Q1,"A 22 year old male presented with progressive left sided facial swelling for 2 weeks. There is history of traumatic injury with wood two months back. CECT nose and paranasal sinuses     shows mass in subcutaneous tissue of left cheek. Biopsy of specimen shows foreign body
granuloma with positive PAS and GMS stain. what is the diagnosis?","a)Phycomycosis
b)Midline lethal granuloma
c)NK/T cell lymphoma
d)IgG4 granuloma","The given clinical scenario is strongly suggestive of phycomycosis/mucormycosis. A positive fungal stain(Grocott-Gomori's methenamine silver stain) narrows down the diagnosis. The   cutaneous disease can be highly invasive, penetrating into muscle, fascia, and even bone.
Mucormycosis is an opportunistic mycosis caused by a number of molds classified in the order
Mucorales . These fungi are ubiquitous thermotolerant saprobes. The leading pathogens among    this group are species of the genera Rhizopus, Mucor, and Absidia. Their spores are present in air and dust.
Mucormycosis can occur as isolated cutaneous or subcutaneous infection in immunologically
normal individuals after traumatic implantation of soil or vegetation. Angio-invasiveness is one of the characteristics of zygomycosis which makes it fatal. Lungs are usually the primary site of
infection. Almost all patients are immunocompromised. Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis
occurs commonly in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. It is the most common form; starts as eye and facial pain may progress to cause orbital cellulitis, proptosis, and vision loss. The
typical finding is the presence of a black necrotic mass filling the nasal cavity.
Diagnosis:
Exudate: wet preparation is made in 1o% potassium hydroxide. Broad, ribbon-like hyphae are seen.
Tissue: Hematoxylin &amp; eosin stain shows non-septate, broad hyphae, often invading into blood vessels. special stains help to identify the fungus in tissue sections.
Biopsy confirms this diagnosis by revealing non-septate hyphae branching at right-angles, which are characteristic of Mucorales such as Rhizopus delemar. The hyphae are broad (1o  15 μm) with  uneven thickness, irregular branching, and sparse septations.
Isolation is by culture on sabouraud agar with an antibacterial agent but without cycloheximide. The colonies are grey-white with a thick cotton, fluffy surface.
Treatment is primarily with liposomal amphotericin B. surgical debridement of the affected tissues and control of underlying predisposing cause is equally important.
other options:
option D: IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is characterized by tissue infiltrates dominated by IgG4 antibodies (the hallmark of the disease). The pathogenesis of this condition is not understood.
This condition leads to fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis. The patients may present as Riedel's   thyroiditis, autoimmune pancreatitis, or idiopathic orbital inflammation. But not with ptosis as shown in the image. Diagnosis is established by positive fibrosis and the presence of plasma
cells on biopsy. Rituximab is known to be beneficial. sometimes, as a rare presentation, this can mimic wegener's granulomatosis.
option B: Midline lethal granuloma is a rare disease. It is characterized by necrotizing destruction and mutilation of the nose and other structures of respiratory passages. Generally, it is a diagnosis



of exclusion. CT may be helpful in picking up the lesions. Negative c-ANCA and fungal stains also aid in the diagnosis.
option C: NK/T cell lymphoma is a destructive lesion usually starting on one side of nose
involving the upper lip, oral cavity, maxilla and sometimes even extending to orbit.Histologically polymorphic lymphoid tissue with angiocentric and angioinvasive features is seen.
Immunochemical staining of biopsy material should be done for CD56+ marker for diagnosis. Nearly all cases of T/NK cel lymphomas are associated with EB virus. Localized T/NK-cell
lymphoma is treated by radiation while a disseminated disease requires chemotherapy.",3267-2021.PNG,A,

b)Anterior ethmoidal nerve
c)sphenopalatine nerve
d)Greater palatine nerve","The given image shows a nasociliary nerve block.
The procedure is done by inserting the needle 1 cm superior and 1.5 cm posterolateral to the medial canthal ligament of the eye.
The nasociliary nerve is a branch of the ophthalmic nerve which in turn is a branch of the trigeminal nerve.
Branches:
• Long ciliary nerve- cornea, ciliary body, iris



• Ramus communicans to the ciliary ganglion
• posterior ethmoidal nerve- sensory innervation to frontal sinus and posterior ethmoidal air cells
• Anterior ethmoidal nerve- sensory innervation to middle and anterior ethmoidal cells as well as lateral part of the nasal septum
• Infra-trochlear nerve (continuation of the nasociliary nerve)- provides innervation to the conjunctiva, lacrimal sac, caruncle, the medial part of the eyelids
uses of nasociliary nerve block:
used in
• surgery of nasal fractures, • septoplasty,
• Rhinoplasty and
• Repair of skin laceration.

d)3-4-5-1-2","The correct sequence of the auditory pathway is spiral ganglion (2) - cochlear nucleus (1) - superior olivary nucleus (3) - inferior colliculus (4) - medial geniculate body (5).
The spiral ganglion contains bipolar cells whose dendrites form the afferent supply for inner and outer hair cells of the organ of Corti and whose axons form the cochlear division of CN VIII that  end in the cochlear nuclei.

Q5,"A 14-year-old is brought to the opd with complaints that she is able to hear the sound of
speech but has difficulty understanding words. Her PTA and BERA were inconsistent with  each other, with PTA being more or less normal. Her middle latency and cortical responses were absent. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Michel aplasia
b)Auditory neuropathy
c)Malingering
d)cochlear otosclerosis","In the clinical scenario, the history of a child presenting with complaints of inability to understand words with abnormal BERA and normal PTA(Pure Tone Audiometry) is suggestive of auditory
neuropathy.



Auditory neuropathy/auditory dyssynchrony is a condition that affects the neural processing of auditory stimuli.
pathophysiology
• Injury to the synaptic junction between inner hair cells of the cochlea and dendrites of spiral ganglion neurons
• Direct damage to the dendrites of the spiral ganglion neurons
• Direct injury to the spiral ganglion neurons
• Direct axonal damage to the auditory nerve
Auditory neuropathy should be suspected in any child with severe speech and language delay out of proportion with the presumed hearing loss.
All of the following must be present in newborns to diagnose auditory neuropathy:
• Absent or severely abnormal ABR test results at maximal stimulus (1oo dBnHL)
• Normal outer hair cell function as determined by oAEs(otoacoustic emission)
• Absent or elevated stapedial reflex thresholds
In addition, adults with mildly to moderately abnormal pure tone thresholds and speech
discrimination scores out of proportion with suspected hearing loss should undergo additional    evaluation. some patients may have normal or slightly elevated audiogram pure tone thresholds
Management includes conventional hearing aids. If a child does not progress with hearing aid
devices and shows limited speech discrimination abilities, cochlear implantation is the next viable option.
other options option A:
Michel aplasia: There is a complete absence of bone and a membranous labyrinth. Even the
petrous apex is absent but external and middle ears may be completely unaffected. The child
presents with congenital sensorineural hearing loss. No hearing aids or cochlear implantation can be used.
option B:
Malingering(Nonorganic hearing loss)
In this type of hearing loss, there is no organic lesion. usually, there is a motive to claim some
compensation for being exposed to industrial noises, head injury, or ototoxic medication. The
patient may present with any of the three clinical situations: Total hearing loss in both ears, total loss in only one ear, or exaggerated loss in one or both ears.
Investigations
Inconsistent results on Repeat pure Tone and speech Audiometry Tests: Normally, the results of repeat tests are within +5 dB. A variation greater than 15 dB is diagnostic of nonorganic hearing  loss (NoHL).
Absence of shadow curve: Normally, a shadow curve can be obtained while testing bone
conduction, if the healthy ear is not masked. This is due to the transcranial transmission of sound to the healthy ear. The absence of this curve in a patient complaining of unilateral deafness is



diagnostic of NOHL.
Inconsistency in PTA and SRT: Normally, the pure tone average (PTA) of three speech frequencies (5oo, 1ooo, and 2ooo Hz) is within 1o dB of the speech reception threshold (SRT). An SRT is
better than PTA by more than 1o dB points to NOHL.
Stenger Test: It helps in identifying malingering
Acoustic Reflex: Threshold Normally, the stapedial reflex is elicited at 7o-1oo dB sensation level. If the patient claims total deafness but the reflex can be elicited, it indicates nonorganic hearing  loss (NOHL).
Option C:
Otosclerosis is the disease of the bony labyrinth in which a normal dense endochondral layer of  the bony otic capsule is replaced by irregularly laid spongy bone. It has a positive family history with an autosomal dominant trait. It is more commonly seen in females between 2o-3o years of age and the hearing loss is aggravated during pregnancy and menopause. It may be associated    with osteogenesis imperfecta and a viral infection like measles.
Stapedial otosclerosis is the most common type of otosclerosis. Here the lesion starts just in front of the oval window in an area called fissula ante fenestram.
Patients present with a bilateral conductive type of hearing loss, tinnitus (commonly in cochlear type and active stage), paracusis willisii (better hearing in noisy surroundings than in a quiet
place), vertigo, and a monotonous, well-modulated soft speech.
The tympanic membrane is quite normal and mobile. Eustachian tube function is also normal. Pure tone audiometry shows a dip at 2ooo Hz in the bone conduction curve known as
the Carhart's notch. Tympanometry shows an As type of tympanogram in which there is reduced compliance at or near the ambient air pressure.
On examination, Schwartz sign/flamingo flush showing a red blush of the tympanic membrane due to vascularity can be seen.
Treatment includes medical, surgical management, and hearing aids. Medical management
with sodium fluoride is used in the active stage to speed up the maturity of the active focus and halt further cochlear loss. The treatment of choice is surgical management which includes
stapedotomy/stapedectomy with the placement of a prosthesis. Hearing aids are used in patients who refuse or are unfit for the surgery.",,B,
Q6,A South Indian male cattle breeder comes with complaints of frank intermittent epistaxis.    The examination of the nose is given below. A biopsy was taken and HPE appears as shown below. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)Nasal polyp
b)Rhinosporidiosis
c)Hemangioma
d)Rhinopyma","The clinical image showing a polyp and the histopathology showing several sporangia is
suggestive of rhinosporidiosis.
Rhinosporidiosis is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi. It is most prevalent in rural districts, among persons bathing in public ponds or working in stagnant water,  such as rice fields. Most common in persons in the age range of 15–4o; males are more commonly affected than females.
The rhinoscopic examination will reveal papular or nodular, smooth-surfaced lesions that become pedunculated and acquire a papillomatous or proliferative appearance. The lesions are pink, red,



or purple in color. Histopathology shows several sporangia, oval, or round in shape and filled with spores.
The treatment of choice is surgical excision of lesions, with or without cauterization. Not many drugs are effective against this disease. Dapsone has been tried with some success.",3346-2092.PNG,B,
Q7,which of the following statements are correct about hair cells?,"a)i, ii, iv
b)i, ii, iii
c)i, iii, iv
d)ii, iii, iv","statements i, ii, and iii are correct.
statement i: There is 1 row of inner hair cells and 3 rows of outer hair cells is a correct statement.
statement ii: Inner hair cells are responsible for transmitting auditory impulses is a correct
statement. Inner hair cells are richly supplied by afferent cochlear fibres and are probably more important in the transmission of auditory impulses.
statement iii: The majority of the afferent fibres of spiral ganglion supply the inner hair cells is a correct statement. Ninety-five percent of afferent fibres of spiral ganglion supply the inner hair
cells while only five percent supply the outer hair cells. Efferent fibres to the hair cells come from the olivocochlear bundle.
statement iv: outer hair cells are important in the modulation of basilar membrane action is an    incorrect statement. outer hair cells mainly receive efferent innervation from the olivary complex and are concerned with modulating the function of inner hair cells.",,B,
Q8,"A 7-year-old male presents with progressive bulging of the right eye with a diminision of     vision since 1 day. He has a history of URTI and on examination, it is seen that he also has nasal congestion with active discharge. The CT scan of the PNs is seen. what is the
diagnosis?","a)sinusitis with preseptal cellulitis
b)sinusitis with orbital cellulitis
c)sinusitis with subperiosteal abcess
d)sinusitis with orbital abscess","In the given clinical scenario, a male patient with symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) exhibits opacity in the right ethmoidal sinus, as shown by the cT image, suggesting a
probable diagnosis of sinusitis. cT scans show a typical lenticular rim-enhancing collection    adjacent to the lamina papyracea with a fat plane between it and the displaced medial rectus muscle, suggesting a diagnosis of sinusitis with subperiosteal abscess.
orbital complications occur most commonly following ethmoid sinusitis as the ethmoid sinus is separated from the orbit by a thin papery bone known as lamina papyracea. Also, the venous
supply of orbit and ethmoid sinuses is the same and additionally, these veins are valveless
(superior and inferior ophthalmic veins). It can vary in degree and severity and is typically graded with the chandler classification.
contrast-enhanced computed tomography (cT) is advised as first-line imaging because of its
superiority in demonstrating bony anatomy and pathology of the orbit and sinuses with its speed and ease of examination. MRI provides outstanding soft tissue detail without radiation exposure.

Q10,The audiogram given in the image below is seen in ______.,"a)ototoxicity
b)presbycusis
c)Noise induced hearing loss
d)Endolymphatic hydrops","The given image shows an upsloping/ ascending audiogram in which lower frequencies are
affected first like in the early stages of Meniere's disease also known as endolymphatic hydrops.
Meniere's disease (endolymphatic hydrops) is an inner ear disorder where the endolymph distends the endolymphatic system.
Meniere's disease is usually unilateral. It is characterized by episodic vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and a sense of ear fullness.
pure tone audiometry reveals a sensorineural type of hearing loss with lower frequencies affected first. It shows a rising type of curve. As the disease progresses, middle and higher frequencies get involved, and the audiogram becomes flat or downsloping type.
The illustration given below shows an audiogram seen in different stages of Meniere's disease.





other options:
option A: ototoxicity causes bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Audiometry
shows a downsloping audiogram, typically involving frequencies above 8,ooo Hz and progresses to lower speech frequencies. Common drugs causing the same include aminoglycoside
antibiotics; loop diuretics (not thiazides); antimalarials; cisplatin; and NSAIDs like ibuprofen, salicylates, and indomethacin.
option B: presbycusis is a physiological sensorineural hearing loss occurring in individuals above 65 years of age. Audiometry shows a downsloping graph.
option C: In noise-induced hearing loss, audiometry shows a typical notch at 4ooo Hz. As the    duration of noise exposure increases, the notch becomes deeper and wider, involving lower and higher frequencies.",3348-2094.PNG,D,3359-2100.PNG;3359-2099.PNG
Q11,A farmer presents with unilateral obstruction of the nasal cavity and nasal bleeding. A mass is found and removed. A biopsy is shown below. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)Rhinosporidiosis
b)Rhinoscleroma
c)Inverted papilloma
d)Angiofibroma","In the above clinical scenario, a patient presenting with unilateral obstruction of the nasal cavity due to the presence of mass and nasal bleeding along with the histopathology showing
several sporangia is most likely suggestive of the diagnosis of rhinosporidiosis.
Rhinosporidiosis is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi. It is most prevalent in rural districts, among persons bathing in public ponds or working in stagnant water,  such as rice fields. Most common in persons in the age range of 15–4o; males are more commonly affected than females.

A patient with rhinosporidiosis is shown below.


other options:
option B: Rhinoscleroma is caused by klebsiella rhinoscleromatis (Frisch bacillus).
Histopathology shows large foam cells with a central nucleus and vacuolated cytoplasm
containing the causative bacilli, which are Mikulicz cells. There are also homogenous eosinophilic inclusion bodies consisting of the immunoglobulins in the plasma cells called the Russell bodies.





option c: Inverted papilloma (transitional cell papilloma) is a tumour originating from
the nonolfactory mucosa of the nose (schneiderian membrane) and paranasal sinuses.
The unilateral growth of hyperplastic papillomatous tissue into the stroma characterizes this
condition. It primarily affects men aged 4o-7o and presents unilaterally with symptoms such
as nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, and epistaxis. Invasive growth into the sinuses or orbit can   lead to proptosis, diplopia, and lacrimation.  A biopsy is essential for diagnosis. Histology shows a thin respiratory epithelium overlying the surface and an underlying stroma containing multiple
nodules of thick neoplastic epithelium growing inward.
option D: Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is seen almost exclusively in males in the age
group of 1o–2o years and is very rarely seen in older people and females. profuse, recurrent, and spontaneous epistaxis is the most common presentation. Diagnosis is mostly
clinical. contrast-enhanced cT scan of the head is the investigation of choice that reveals anterior bowing of the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus (Antral sign/Holman Miller sign) which is
pathognomonic of angiofibroma.",3349-2096.PNG,A,3360-2101.PNG;3361-2102.PNG
Q12,"out of the four given statements, which is true about coughing?","a)i, ii, iii
b)i, iv
c)ii, iv
d)ii, iii","coughing is a type of forceful expiration. During forceful expiration, when pressure builds up, the glottis opens and then the air comes out. The cough reflex is a protective mechanism of the larynx to expel irritants and keep the airway clear.
coughing begins with a deep inspiration followed by a forced expiration against a closed glottis. This increases the intrapleural pressure to 1oo mm Hg or more. The glottis is then suddenly
opened, producing an explosive outflow of air at velocities up to 965 km (6oo ml) per hour.
Both chemical and mechanical stimuli can initiate the cough reflex. chemical or mechanical
irritation of the respiratory mucosa stimulates the afferent internal laryngeal nerve, which is the branch of the superior laryngeal nerve of the vagus nerve. These sensory fibres synapse in the
nucleus tractus solitarius in the medulla oblongata. complex neural networks here generate the conscious 'urge to cough' while also sending efferent signals to the various muscles involved in



generating an effective cough which include the adductors of the vocal cord, the diaphragm, the external intercostals and the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall.
other options
statement ii and iii: It is the forceful expiration, not just a normal expiration or deep inspiration which opens the glottis.",,B,
Q13,"A 32-year-old female presents with progressive bilateral hearing loss, in the right ear more than left. After the initial evaluation, a stapedotomy of the right ear was planned. what
might've been the tuning fork test results of the patient?","a)Bilateral Rinne's negative, weber's lateralized to the right
b)Bilateral Rinne's negative, weber's lateralized to the left
c)Bilateral Rinne's positive, weber's lateralized to the right
d)Bilateral Rinne's positive, weber's lateralized to the left","In the given clinical scenario, a female with progressive bilateral hearing loss, in the right ear
more than the left, and a stapedotomy of the right ear was planned. stapedotomy surgery is done for otosclerosis. otosclerosis results in conductive hearing loss so, the tuning fork test results of   the patient will be Bilateral Rinne's negative, weber's lateralized to the right.
As there is conductive hearing loss in both ears, like that associated with otosclerosis (which may require a stapedotomy), the bilateral Rinne test will be negative. In weber's test, the sound
lateralizes to the affected ear, which, in this case, is the right ear with more significant hearing loss.
Tuning fork tests are performed commonly with tuning forks of frequencies such as 128, 256, 512, 1024, etc. The tuning fork of 512 Hz is considered ideal as forks oflower frequencies produce a
sense of bone vibration, while those of higher frequencies have a shorter decay time.
Rinne’s test is done by placing a vibrating tuning fork on the patient’s mastoid and when he stops hearing, it is brought beside the external auditory meatus (EAC). If he still hears the sound, air
conduction (AC) is better than bone conduction (BC) i.e. AC&gt;BC. The inferences are as follows:
• Rinne's test is considered positive (normal) when the air conduction AC&gt;BC is seen in normal people and people with sensorineural deafness.
• It is considered negative when the BC&gt;AC, and is seen in patients with conductive deafness. weber test is done by placing a vibrating tuning in the middle of the forehead or the vertex and  the patient is asked in which ear the sound is heard. The inferences are as follows:
• Normal result is achieved when the sound heard equally in both ears
• In conductive deafness, it is lateralized to the worse ear
• In sensorineural deafness, it is lateralized to the better ear.",,A,3403-2133.PNG
