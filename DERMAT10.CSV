Q1,"A 1o-year-old boy presents with fever, joint pain, and a lesion over his hand as seen in the image below. which of the following is the clinical finding given and what is the likely
diagnosis?","a)Gottron's papules - Juvenile dermatomyositis
b)Rheumatoid nodules - Juvenile rheumatic arthritis
c)sclerodactyly - systemic sclerosis
d)Mechanic's hand - systemic lupus erythematosus","The given image showing erythematous papules over dorsal metacarpophalangeal and
interphalangeal joints (Gottron’s papules) is a characteristic skin lesion seen in
dermatomyositis (DM). Fever and joint pain (arthralgia) are non-specific complaints.
DM is an inflammatory myopathy affecting skin and skeletal muscle. DM can be seen in children (juvenile DM) or in adults. It presents with symmetric, proximal more than distal muscle
weakness associated with characteristic skin manifestations:
• Heliotrope rash: Lilac erythema of eyelids with periorbital edema




• Gottron’s papules: Violaceous, flat■topped papules on the skin overlying the interphalangeal joints and metacarpophalangeal joints


• Gottron sign: Erythematous rash over the extensor surfaces of joints such as the knuckles, elbows, knees, and ankles
• V-sign: Erythematous macules over anterior chest


• shawl sign: Erythematous macules over posterior neck and upper back
• Mechanic's hand: Roughening and cracking of the skin of the tips and sides of the fingers,
resulting in irregular, dirty-appearing lines that resemble those of a mechanic or manual laborer
• Nail bed telangiectasias
• subcutaneous calcium deposits
DM is associated with interstitial lung diseases (ILD) and internal malignancies, most commonly adenocarcinomas. Adult onset DM has a stronger association with malignancies.



Laboratory evaluation of patients with dermatomyositis will reveal elevated serum creatinine
kinase and antinuclear antibodies. Electromyography will reveal features of myopathy. Histology will show perifascicular atrophy. Immunohistochemical staining will reveal myxovirus resistance protein A, a sensitive and specific marker.
Treatment of dermatomyositis is include:
• Immunotherapy with high-dose glucocorticoids - first-line drug
• Methotrexate - second line drug. Indications include -
• when patient presents with severe weakness, or other organ system involvement
• patients with risk of steroid complications like patients with diabetes, osteoporosis, or postmenopausal women
• patients who do not show improvement after 2-4 months of treatment with prednisone or those who cannot be maintained on a low dose
• Triple therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin or rituximab may be required The prognosis is favourable in the absence of associated ILD or malignancies.",3653-2332.PNG,A,3661-2339.PNG
Q2,A 12-week pregnant woman who is already on multidrug therapy for leprosy presents with type 2 lepra reaction. what is the treatment of choice for this patient?,"a)stop MDT and start oral steroids
b)Antibiotics
c)Thalidomide
d)continue MDT and add oral steroids","The treatment of choice for a pregnant lady with type 2 lepra reaction is to continue multidrug
therapy (MDT) and start oral steroids. MDT is not stopped in lepra reactions. MDT is proven to be safe in pregnancy. Thalidomide is contraindicated (especially in the 1st trimester) due to the risk    of teratogenic changes in the fetus (phocomelia).
Type 2 lepra reaction or erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an immune complex-mediated     syndrome (type 3 hypersensitivity) affecting the skin, nerves, and other organs. It is mainly seen in the multibacillary form of leprosy and is commonly recurrent. It usually occurs during
treatment, but can also be seen before or after treatment.
ENL presents with acute onset, painful, erythematous nodules on the face and extensor     surfaces of limbs that blanch on pressure. systemic manifestations include fever, malaise, anorexia, neuritis, uveitis, dactylitis, arthritis, myositis, etc. can also be seen.
Treatment includes:
• Thalidomide is the drug of choice in young men with severe or recurrent ENL. It is
contraindicated during pregnancy due to its high teratogenicity causing phocomelia. Even in women of reproductive age, it is given with caution.
• Glucocorticoids (high doses) are routinely used in all patients and help in suppressing the acute signs and symptoms of inflammation.
• clofazimine is useful as long-term maintenance therapy for preventing recurrent reactions.
clofazimine is not given to this patient because it is already a part of the MDT regimen containing dapsone, rifampicin, and clofazimine.",,D,
Q3,"A patient presents to the outpatient department with a satellite skin lesion. on examination, he has one hypopigmented lesion and one thickened nerve. Images of two blister packs are    given below. The treatment best suited for this patient would be:","a)packet 1 for 12 months
b)packet 2 for 12 months
c)packet 1 for 6 months
d)packet 2 for 6 months","The treatment best suited for this patient would be packet 2-maroon for 6 months. The clinical scenario of one hypopigmented satellite skin lesion and one thickened nerve suggests
paucibacillary leprosy. The treatment of paucibacillary leprosy (PB) is multidrug therapy (MDT) with rifampicin, dapsone, and clofazimine which is the maroon blister packet for 6 months.
The current recommendation by wHO is to treat PB leprosy with a combination of 3 drugs - rifampicin, dapsone, and clofazimine (maroon blister pack) for 6
months. Meanwhile, multibacillary (MB) leprosy is treated using the same 3 drugs for a duration of 12 months. while the NLEP guidelines earlier mentioned a 2-drug MDT for PB leprosy, the
National strategic Plan and Roadmap for Leprosy (2023-2027) now recommends a uniform MDT of 3 drugs for both PB and MB leprosy.
Management of leprosy is based on the bacterial load. wHO defines PB disease as the presence of no bacilli on smears or biopsy and less than or equal to 5 skin lesions with no or only one
peripheral nerve involved. MB leprosy is characterized by bacilli on smears or biopsies of more than 5 skin lesions and more than 1 peripheral nerve involvement.
The image given below shows a hypopigmented satellite skin lesion seen in leprosy.


chemoprophylaxis for leprosy should be given in those
• Age more than 2 years
• close contact for more than 20 hours per week for more than 3 months
A single dose of rifampicin is recommended for the close contact of a patient with leprosy provided they do not develop any signs or symptoms pertaining to leprosy.",3654-2333.PNG,D,3664-2342.PNG
Q4,chemoprophylaxis for leprosy should be given to which of the following persons?,"a)1, 2, 4
b)1, 3, 4
c)2, 3, 4

chemoprophylaxis for leprosy should be given to the following contacts:
• A person who has been in close contact with the index case for 2o hours or more per week for more than 3 months.
• close contact if the age is more than 2 years
The contact mentioned in option 4, is with the patient for more than 3 months. Therefore, even this contact will require chemoprophylaxis.
chemoprophylaxis cannot be given if there is/are:
• possible signs of leprosy
• signs or confirmed tuberculosis
• Liver or kidney disease
• pregnancy
• Received rifampicin in the last 2 years
A single dose of rifampicin is used in chemoprophylaxis. chemoprophylaxis must be initiated only 4 weeks after treatment for leprosy has begun in the patient so as to ensure the patient is
non-infectious.

Q6,"A 6o-year-old patient presents with the lesion given in the image below. He also describes
having the sensation of spiders crawling in the area of the lesion when he woke up. which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Herpes zoster infection
b)Irritant contact dermatitis
c)Allergic contact dermatitis
d)Herpes simplex infection","The given image showing unilateral, red, grouped vesicles in a single dermatome associated with crawling sensation is highly suggestive of Herpes zoster infection.
Herpes zoster infection or shingles is a segmental eruption due to the reactivation of latent
varicella-zoster virus from the dorsal root ganglia. An earlier infection with varicella is essential



before zoster can occur.
The first symptom of zoster is usually pain. It may also be accompanied by fever, headache,
malaise, and tenderness localized to areas of one or more dorsal roots. The mucous membranes within the affected dermatomes are involved.
The patients are infectious, both from the virus in the lesions and the nasopharynx. The most
commonly involved dermatomes in decreasing order of frequency are thoracic &gt; cervical &gt; trigeminal &gt; lumbosacral. The posterior nerve roots and ganglia show inflammatory changes. zoster is a self■limiting infection but it is painful and carries a risk of secondary infection and    post■herpetic neuralgia. Analgesia and treatment of secondary infections are sufficient for mild infections.
other options:
option B: Irritant contact dermatitis is the cutaneous response to the physical/toxic effects of a wide range of environmental exposures. The main clinical features are
usually dryness or chapping. The lesions could commonly develop into patchy or diffuse erythema with scaling and fissuring.
option C: Allergic contact dermatitis is an eczematous reaction following exposure to a substance to which the immune system has previously been sensitized.
option D: Herpes simplex lesions are thin-walled, umbilicated vesicles, the roof of which breaks down, leaving tiny superficial ulcers. They heal without scarring. The most common site of
cutaneous lesions in the face - is on the cheeks, chin, around the mouth, or on the forehead.",3618-2297.PNG,A,
Q7,"A 6o-year-old diabetic female patient presents with progressive skin lesions, as shown in the image. what is the diagnosis?","a)squamous cell carcinoma
b)Basal cell carcinoma
c)Discoid lupus eryhtematosus
d)Melasma","The image above shows a central ulcer with raised borders and rolled-out edges (rodent ulcer) suggesting a diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma.
Basal cell carcinoma is a slow-growing malignant tumor with locally invasive characteristics. It affects the pilosebaceous skin.
ultraviolet radiation exposure is the strongest predisposing factor. other risk factors include exposure to arsenic, coal tar, aromatic hydrocarbons, and ionizing radiation.
Basal cell carcinoma mainly affects elderly or middle-aged men with excessive skin exposure, commonly in the age group of 4o–8o y and in white-skinned people.
Macroscopically, it is categorized as localized and generalized. Nodular, nodulocystic (nodular and nodulocystic together account for 9o% of basal cell carcinoma), pigmented, and nevoid are the
localized cancers, while superficial multifocal and superficial spreading, infiltrative, and
cicatrizing are the generalized types. The nodular type is described as pearly waxy nodules at the  margins. A central depression (umbilication) or ulceration and rolled-out edges are characteristic of basal cell carcinoma.
The below gross image shows pearly, rolled-out borders suggestive of basal cell carcinoma.





sites near the eye, nose, and ear and of size &gt;2 cm are considered to be high risk. Direct invasion at these sites can reach the cranium.
Management is by Mohs microscopic surgery. Non-surgical measures, such as the administration of topical 5-fluorouracil and imiquimod, are useful. Metastasis is extremely rare.
other options:
option A:  squamous cell carcinoma (scc) is the second most common skin cancer. Uv radiation  exposure is the primary risk factor for scc. classically, it appears as a scaly or ulcerated papule or plaque that can bleed with minimal trauma, but the pain is rare. It can exhibit in situ (confined to  the epidermis) or invasive subtypes. wide surgical excision including subcutaneous fat is the
treatment of choice for scc.
option c: Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE): DLE is typically located on the nose, cheeks, ear    lobe, and concha. It may involve lips, oral mucosa, nose, or eyelids. Initial lesions of DLE are dry red patches, which then progress to indurated red or hyperpigmented plaques with adherent
scale. Follicular keratosis (plugs of keratin within hair follicles) is observed when the surface scales are removed (carpet-tack sign). older lesions are hyperpigmented, especially on
the plaque edges. There is scarring, which results in central loss of pigment, white patches, and skin atrophy.





option D: Melasma is the most common cause of facial melanosis that manifests as
hyperpigmented macules on the face. It is exacerbated by sun exposure and oral contraceptive
pills. The condition is predominantly seen in females. Melasma is very common in the 3rd
trimester of pregnancy and is most marked in brunettes. It occurs due to increased levels
of estrogen and progesterone, stimulating the activity of melanocytes. It resolves on its own after pregnancy. Hypermelanosis affects mainly the upper lip, the malar regions, forehead, and the
chin.",3656-2335.PNG,B,3667-2343.PNG;3668-2345.PNG;3668-2344.PNG
Q8,A diabetic patient presents with the following lesions in the armpit. which of the following would be seen on wood's lamp examination?,"a)yellow fluorescence
b)coral red fluorescence
c)Blue fluorescence
d)Green fluorescence","The image showing brown patches in axilla in a diabetic patient is suggestive of erythrasma. coral■red fluorescence under wood’s lamp is seen in erythrasma.



Erythrasma is a skin infection caused by corynebacterium minutissimum. It is common
in diabetics and immunodeficient patients and is associated with obesity, sweating, and poor
hygiene. It affects the axillae, groins, toe webs, inter-gluteal and submammary regions. Lesions may be symptomless or show mild discomfort and itching.
The lesions may be of irregular shape with sharp margins. They may start as smooth, red patches and then become brown. The lesions are more likely to be pruritic in tropical regions and may be asymptomatic in a temperate climate.
coral■red fluorescence with wood’s light is due to coproporphyrin III and suggests erythrasma. The fluorescence may persist after the eradication of the disease.
Treatment of erythrasma is by using topical clotrimazole and miconazole for two weeks. For more extensive lesions, erythromycin can be administered. Relapse can occur. In such cases, long-term  topical povidone-iodine application with drying agents can be used. photodynamic therapy can
also be attempted.
Green and blue-green fluorescence is seen in tinea capitis infections associated with microspora species and favus.
pityriasis versicolor is caused by Malassezia species and the typical lesions
are asymptomatic hypopigmented or hyperpigmented macules and patches and produce fine scales. The color of the scales may vary from pale ochre to medium brown. pale
yellow fluorescence seen in wood’s lamp examination is characteristic of tinea versicolor or pityriasis versicolor.",3656-2334.PNG,B,3669-2346.PNG;3669-2346.PNG;3670-2347.PNG
Q9,A 1o-year-old boy is brought with weakness in his lower limbs and rash over the eyelids. The biopsy shows inflammation of the muscle. what is the finding shown in the image below?,"a)Gottron's papules
b)shawl sign
c)Heliotrope rash
d)scleroderma","The finding shown in the image is Gottron's papules. The given scenario of a patient with
weakness, rash, muscle inflammation, and presence of Gottron's papules on the skin is highly suggestive of dermatomyositis.
Dermatomyositis (DM) is an autoimmune disorder predominantly affecting the skin and skeletal muscle. The following are various manifestations of dermatomyositis:
• proximal myopathy: patients have trouble performing everyday activities like climbing stairs, getting up, and lifting their arms above their heads
• Gottron's papules: violaceous, erythematous papules overlying the dorsal interphalangeal or metacarpophalangeal, elbow, or knee joints, as shown in the image below
• Gottron's sign: symmetric, non-scaling, violaceous, erythematous macules or plaques, often atrophic, in the same distribution as Gottron's papules
• shawl sign/v-sign: Fixed macular erythema, across the shoulders and outer arms (shawl distribution)
• periungual telangiectasias: Dilated capillaries of the nail folds
• Mechanic's hand: Roughening and cracking of the skin of the tips and sides of the fingers,
resulting in irregular, dirty-appearing lines that resemble those of a mechanic or manual laborer
• Less common manifestations include: Facial swelling, malignancy, erythroderma, lichen planus
Laboratory evaluation of patients with dermatomyositis will reveal elevated levels of serum
creatine kinase and antinuclear antibodies. Electromyography will reveal features of myopathy.   Histology will show perifascicular atrophy. Immunohistochemical staining will reveal myxovirus resistance protein A, a sensitive and specific marker.
Treatment of dermatomyositis:
• Immunotherapy with high-dose glucocorticoids - first-line drug



• Methotrexate - second-line drug; indications include the following
• when the patient presents with severe weakness, or other organ system involvement
• Patients with a risk of steroid complications like patients with diabetes, osteoporosis, or postmenopausal women
• Patients who do not show improvement after 2–4 months of treatment with prednisone or those who cannot be maintained on a low dose

Q10,consider the causes of alopecia. which among the following cause(s) non-scarring alopecia?,"a)3 and 4
b)1, 2, and 3
c)2, 3, and 4
d)only 4","Non-scarring alopecia is caused by androgenic alopecia, alopecia areata, and telogen effluvium (1,
2 and 3).  Frontal fibrosing alopecia is a type of primary cicatricial (scarring) alopecia.
Alopecia areata is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes non-scarring hair loss. It is
a T-cell-mediated inflammatory disease. It is associated with several autoimmune diseases,
including thyroiditis, lupus erythematosus, vitiligo, and psoriasis. It mainly affects the scalp, but    can also affect the beard, eyebrows, and eyelashes. In some cases, this progresses to a total loss of scalp hair (alopecia totalis) or a loss of all hair on the body (alopecia universalis).
Telogen effluvium is a type of nonscarring alopecia that is marked by diffuse shedding of normal hair. This occurs due to premature termination of the anagen phase of the hair cycle.  It can be    either acute or chronic.
• Acute telogen effluvium occurs 2–3 months after a stressful event such as high fever, surgery,
starvation, and hemorrhage. Hormonal fluctuations during the postpartum period can trigger it
(telogen gravidarum). Telogen effluvium can result in a diffuse reduction in hair density but never total baldness. It generally resolves spontaneously.
• chronic telogen effluvium is used to describe the diffuse shedding of telogen hair for more than 6 months. common causes include thyroid disorders, iron-deficiency anemia, and
malnutrition.
Androgenetic alopecia is a disorder characterized by a reduction of hair fiber production by
follicles and miniaturization. Dihydrotestosterone, an androgenic metabolite, is implicated in the etiology. It is of two types: male-pattern and female-pattern hair loss. Male-pattern hair loss
causes frontal hairline recession and thinning of the vertex.  Female-pattern hair loss involves the mid-frontal scalp diffusely. There is no or minimal involvement of the temporal region.",,B,

PUVA is highly effective in clearing psoriasis with clearance rates of over 9o%. It is associated
with both acute (erythema, blistering) and chronic side effects. Long-term PUVA use is associated with the development of non-melanoma skin cancer (squamous cell cancer and basal cell cancer).



cyclosporine is associated primarily with renal impairment (decreased GFR), metabolic
disturbances, and an increased risk of malignancy. Due to its nephrotoxic effects, it is now uncommonly used for the maintenance of psoriasis.
Both acitretin and methotrexate are teratogenic.
Acitretin is associated with dose-dependent mucocutaneous side effects (mucositis) and hyperlipidemia. To prevent retinoid-induced embryopathy, female patients
should avoid conception for 3 years after discontinuing acitretin treatment. Acitretin is approved for use in the cutaneous manifestations of psoriasis.
Absolute contraindications:
• pregnant women
• women who are planning to conceive
• Breastfeeding
Methotrexate is also associated with mucositis and teratogenicity, it has been used as an abortifacient and is used in the management of molar pregnancies. Methotrexate is also  associated with hepatotoxicity.

Q12,skin manifestations caused by the drug administered for amebic dysentery are due to ______.,"a)Fixed drug eruption
b)urticaria
c)Maculopapular rash
d)Atopic dermatitis","The skin manifestations are most commonly due to metronidazole, which is associated with fixed drug eruption (FDE).
Although maculopapular rashes can also be seen with metronidazole, the incidence of a fixed drug eruption is higher with metronidazole.
Fixed drug eruptions/ reactions are characterized by sharply demarcated, dull red to
brown lesions. They occur on lips, hands, legs, face, genitalia, and oral mucosa, and can cause a
burning sensation. They are usually solitary or few in number and recur at the exact location. But, new lesions can occur on different body parts on re-exposure to the offending drug.
FDE is a type of delayed hypersensitivity reaction. paracetamol/NSAIDs are some of the most common drugs causing FDE.
Drug■specific clinical patterns of FDE include:



Diagnosis is based on history and lesion morphology. Discontinuation of the offending drug is the first step in management.

b)1, 2, 3
c)1, 3, 4
d)1, 2, 3, 4","The clinical scenario points to a case of leprosy. The diagnosis of this condition requires nerve examination, skin biopsy, and a slit skin smear (option B- 1, 2, 3).
Leprosy is a chronic granulomatous condition caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It affects the skin, cutaneous and peripheral nerves, and mucous membranes. The most commonly affected
peripheral nerves are the posterior tibial nerve, followed by the ulnar, median, and lateral popliteal nerves. The most commonly involved cranial nerve is the facial nerve.
Leprosy has a long incubation period, usually ranging from 2 to 12 years. It commonly presents as an area of numbness on the skin or a visible skin lesion which could be a hypopigmented or
erythematous macule. Lesions usually involve the face, extensor aspect of the limbs, trunks, and buttocks. The lesions have impaired nerve function and poor hair growth. The patients may also present with burns or ulcers of the anesthetic limb.
classification systems of leprosy:



• Ridley-Jopling classification:
• Tuberculoid (TT)
• Borderline tubercular (BT)
• Borderline (BB)
• Borderline lepromatous (BL)
• Lepromatous (LL)
• WHO classification:
• paucibacillary
• Multibacillary
cardinal signs for the diagnosis of leprosy:
• characteristic skin lesions- hypopigmented or erythematous lesions with definite impairment of sensation.
• peripheral nerve involvement- thickening of the nerve with sensory impairment. Nerve tenderness can also be seen.
• Detection of acid-fast bacilli in slit-skin smear, skin biopsy, or positive biopsy pcR.
The presence of two of the three signs can establish the diagnosis of leprosy. Other tests done for  diagnosis of leprosy include nerve biopsy in pure neural leprosy and pGL-1 antibody in cases with low bacterial load.",,B,
Q14,Identify the condition shown in the image below.,"a)paget disease
b)Lichen sclerosus
c)Lichen planus
d)Angioma of vulva","The given image shows lichen sclerosus.
Lichen sclerosus usually presents in postmenopausal women. Multiple etiologies have been suggested (infectious, hormonal, genetic, and autoimmune). symptoms
include itching, excoriations, vulval skin thinning and crinkling, dysuria, and
dyspareunia. perianal involvement is frequently seen in the form figure of 8 appearance. The typical appearance is white, atrophic papules may coalesce into plaques and distort normal    anatomy. Labia minora regression, clitoral concealment, urethral obstruction, and introital     stenosis can develop. A biopsy is needed to exclude malignancy.
Topical corticosteroids remain the first line of treatment.
premalignant lesions of vulva:
• Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN)
• paget’s disease
• Lichen sclerosus
• squamous cell hyperplasia
• condyloma accuminata
• Bowen’s disease (erythroplasia of Queyrat)



Lichen planus is an inflammatory disorder affecting the skin and mucosal membranes. Nail
involvement includes exaggeration of the longitudinal lines and linear depression. It manifests as   6ps pruritic, purple, polygonal, planar, papules, and plaques. It also exhibits wickham striae (thin white lacy lines on the lesion), and the koebner phenomenon (new lesions at sites of skin trauma). Mucosal involvement is common including mouth and tongue, rarely it can also be found on the    anus and genitalia
The histological changes in lichen planus include increased Langerhans cells in the epidermis,
spongiosis, and sawtooth appearance of Rete ridges. A fully developed lichen planus papule shows acanthosis of the epidermis, thickening of the granular layer, and hyperkeratosis. The image
below shows the histopathological changes in lichen planus.



vulvar paget disease is an intraepithelial neoplasia that presents as an eczematoid, red, weeping area on the vulva. It is associated with invasive paget disease or adenocarcinoma of the vulva or
carcinoma at another non-vulvar location. It can be managed by local excision or vulvectomy. This condition needs long-term surveillance as recurrence is very common.



Angioma of vulva - Hemangiomas and angiokeratomas are benign lesions of the vulva.
Angiokeratomas are benign tumors characterized by hyperplasia of the epidermis along with
multiple dilated vessels in the superficial dermis. They present as well-defined, erythematous,
hyperkeratotic papules. senile (cherry) hemangiomas usually present as red macules that rapidly progress to well-circumscribed, raised, red, and soft lesions. Excision biopsy of bleeding
hemangiomas, cryosurgery, or carbon dioxide laser can be used for management.

b)salt and pepper pigmentation
c)Leukotrichia
d)vitiligo","The clinical scenario is suggestive of systemic sclerosis, and the skin manifestation shown is a salt-and-pepper appearance.
systemic sclerosis is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology, complex pathogenesis, and     variable clinical presentations. It is associated with significant disability and mortality. virtually every organ is affected. Thickened and indurated skin, called scleroderma, is the distinguishing  hallmark of systemic sclerosis.
cutaneous features of systemic sclerosis:
• Raynaud phenomenon, with the typical white discoloration of the fingers caused by vasospasm and bluish discoloration of the fingertips
• Loss of pigmentation except in the perifollicular areas is known as the salt and pepper appearance of the skin, which is mostly seen in the upper back, chest, and scalp
• puffy fingers in early disease
• sclerodactyly and sclerosis extending proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints with or without contractures
• vasculopathic ulcers over the bony prominences
• Loss of fingertip pulp



• severe flexion contractures
• Facial features include expressionless facies, mat■like telangiectases, microstomia, perioral furrowing, and a beak■like nose
other options:
option A: poikiloderma is a skin disorder characterized by hypopigmentation and
hyperpigmentation, wrinkling following atrophy, and telangiectasias. It is seen in ionizing radiation-damaged skin and dermatomyositis.
option C: The hair in the amelanotic lesions of vitiligo can sometimes lose color and become white. This is called leukotrichia.

c)psoriasis
d)Lichen planus","The diagnosis in this patient with the above clinical features is psoriasis.
The image shows nail pitting, oil drop sign, and salmon patches in fingernails
psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the skin with systemic manifestations. The skin lesions can have exacerbations and relapse. They include red, silvery-white well-demarcated
scales. A peripheral clearing known as the ring ofworonoff may be present. It is usually seen on the scalp, trunk, and extensor surfaces of the limbs. The appearance of a smooth, glossy red
membrane with small bleeding points on the removal of the supra-papillary epidermis by gentle scraping is known as Auspitz's sign.
psoriatic arthritis presents as early morning stiffness and joint swelling, heel pain due to
enthesitis of the Achilles tendon, or plantar fasciitis. The clinical examination may reveal evidence of dactylitis (sausage fingers) or swollen or tender joints. The distal interphalangeal joint (DIp) is   classically involved in causing pencil-in cup deformity.
punctate pitting is the most common nail finding and others include the oil-drop sign, subungual hyperkeratosis, splinter haemorrhages, and distal onycholysis.
The topical application of steroids, retinoids, vitamin D, and emollients is the mainstay of
management. phototherapy and oral methotrexate, acitretin, and cyclosporine are used for more extensive and systemic diseases.",3660-2338.PNG,C,
