Q5,Gamma delta T cell(γδ TCRs) receptors recognizes,"a)Lipids without MHC proteins
b)peptides with MHC proteins
c)CD2o
d)CD3","γδ TCRs (T-cell receptors) have been shown to recognize lipid antigens presented by CD1d in an MHC-independent manner
T lymphocytes develop in the thymus from precursors that arise from hematopoietic stem cells.  Mature T cells are found in the blood, where they constitute 6o% to 7o% of lymphocytes, and in T-cell zones of peripheral lymphoid organs.
• Each T cell recognizes a specific cell-bound antigen by means of an antigen-specific T-cell receptor (TCR).
• In approximately 95% of T cells, the TCR consists of a disulfide-linked heterodimer made up of
α and β polypeptide chain, each having a variable (antigen-binding) region and a constant region.



• The αβ TCR recognizes peptide antigens that are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surfaces of antigen-presenting cells. By limiting the specificity of T cells    for peptides displayed by cell surface MHC molecules, called MHC restriction, the immune system ensures that T cells see only cell-associated antigens.
•
• A small population of mature T cells expresses another type ofTCR composed of γ and δ
polypeptide chains. The γδ TCR recognizes lipids, and small molecules, without a requirement for display by MHC proteins.",,A,
Q6,Cancer that least commonly spreads by lymphatic route is ______.,"a)squamous cell carcinoma
b)Merkel Cell Carcinoma
c)Basal Cell Carcinoma
d)Malignant melanoma","Basal cell carcinoma is a locally aggressive tumor that rarely spreads by the lymphatic route.
Mutations in sonic hedgehog pathway are associated with it.
It presents as small, slowly growing pearly nodule, often with tortuous telangiectatic vessels on its surface, rolled borders, and a central crust (nodular BCC).
The occasional presence of melanin in this variant of nodular BCC (pigmented BCC) may lead to confusion with melanoma.
The most common site is the inner canthus of the eye.
Basal cell carcinoma does not show lymphatic or hematogenous metastasis. It is primarily locally invasive.",,C,
Q7,what is correct regarding transfusion of the blood received from blood bank?,"a)It should be started within 4 hours of receiving it from the blood bank.
b)It should be completed within 4 hours of receiving from the blood bank.
c)No such time restraint and can be done anytime.
d)It should be completed within 6 hours of receiving from the blood bank.","Blood received from blood bank should be completely transfused within 4 hours of receiving.
principles of blood administration:
• All blood products should be given through an appropriate blood administration set containing a filter.
• A careful aseptic technique should be practised at all times.
• vital signs should be documented before and after transfusion and as clinically required. For the first 15 minutes after the infusion has begun, the patient should be kept under close observation    to detect any signs of a serious transfusion reaction. If none is observed, the infusion rate may be  increased.
• one unit of red cells is often given in 1 to 4 hours, depending on the amount to be transfused and on the patient’s cardiovascular status. Infusion of a unit for longer than 4 hours is not
recommended, as there is a risk of bacterial proliferation because the opened unit is at room temperature.
• No other solution and no medication should be added to or infused through the same tubing as a blood product.



• Ringer’s lactate or other solutions containing calcium must never be added to a blood product because the calcium present leads to coagulation.
• After the transfusion has been completed, the transfusion tag or record should become part of the patient’s chart.",,B,
Q8,A patient working in a factory presented with lung fibrosis and thickening of pleura. Biopsy was done. Diagnosis from the histopathology picture is:,"a)Asbestosis
b)silicosis
c)Tuberculosis
d)Mesothelioma","This clinical scenario and image showing typical asbestos bodies are suggestive of asbestosis.

Q11,which of the following is a true statement about apoptosis?,"a)There is enzymatic digestion of cellular contents
b)It is associated with adjacent inflammation
c)karyolysis is present
d)plasma membrane remains intact","The plasma membrane remains intact in apoptosis.
Apoptosis literally means falling-off in Greek. It is a pathway of programmed cell death.
Apoptotic cells break up into fragments called apoptotic bodies. These apoptotic bodies have
intact plasma membrane but altered structures. Hence, they are subjected to phagocytosis without eliciting inflammation.
Necrosis is an unprogrammed form of cell death that includes:
• Enzymatic digestion
• Adjacent inflammation
• karyolysis",,D,

• Mixed variant (MCD) - mix of hypervascular and plasma cell subtype features in the same lymph node
The clinical features include:
• Multiple enlarged lymph nodes
• Night sweats
• weight loss
• weakness and fatigue
• Hepatosplenomegaly

Q18,which of the following is involved in recognition and clearance of necrotic cells?,"a)Inflammasome
b)Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
c)P selectin
d)Manoreceptor","Inflammasomes are involved in the recognition and clearance of necrotic cells.
Inflammasomes are involved in pyroptosis, a process of programmed cell death distinct from
apoptosis and necrosis. This process is dependent on caspases 1, 4, and 5 and is responsible for killing of infected cells. It occurs in the following sequence:
• Activation of inflammasome complex by infected cells
• This causes activation of caspase-1
• This results in generation of IL-1, which is responsible for fever, inflammation, leukocyte recruitment
option B: Toll-like receptors (TLR)- recognizes molecules shared by pathogens
option C: P-selectins - an important role in the initial recruitment of wBCs at the site of inflammation &amp; in platelet recruitment and aggregation at the site of injury.",,A,
