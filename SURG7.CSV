Q1,which of the following is true about the flap given in the image.,"a)Pedicled TRAM based on superior epigastric artery
b)Free TRAM based on superior and inferior epigastric artery
c)DIEP based on deep inferior epigastric artery
d)Lower Abdominal Fat based inferior epigastric vessels","The given image showing only skin and fat moved to the chest is suggestive of a deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap (DIEP), based on the deep inferior epigastric artery.



DIEP is a variant of TRAM flap and free flap where only the skin and fat are moved to the chest. A microvascular technique is used in which no muscle is taken and the perforating vessels are
dissected out.
As the muscle is spared in DIEP, there is a reduced risk of abdominal wall weakness and its associated complications.
other options:
options A and B: The pedicled TRAM flap is based on the superior epigastric artery and the free TRAM flap is based on superior and inferior epigastric arteries (supercharged TRAM flap);
however, the given image depicts a deep inferior epigastric artery flap. In TRAM flaps:
• The skin, fat, and muscle are moved to the chest.
• It provides good cosmesis and bulk since it has a soft tissue consistency similar to the breast.
• Disadvantages include epigastric bulge, partial flap loss, fat necrosis, abdominal wall weakness, and hernias.
The given image below shows a TRAM flap:",4835-3020.PNG,C,4845-3025.PNG
Q2,what is the most common site of gastrinoma in MEN 1 syndrome?,"a)Jejunum
b)Ileum
c)Duodenum
d)stomach","The most common site of gastrinoma in MEN 1 syndrome is the duodenum.
Gastrinoma is the most common pancreatic islet tumor in MEN 1 syndrome, arising from the G  cells of the pancreas. Gastrinoma, associated with marked gastric acid production and recurrent peptic ulcers, is called zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The majority of gastrinomas occur in the
gastrinoma (Passaro's) triangle.
In MEN 1, they often occur in patients &lt;3o years. Patients present with abdominal pain (the most common symptom), diarrhea and steatorrhea.
Management:



• Medical management for tumors &lt;2 cm with proton-pump inhibitors.
• surgery for tumors &gt;2 cm.
• Proton-pump inhibitors with somatostatin analogues for advanced locoregional disease or metastasis.",,C,
Q3,A 5o-year-old male who is a chronic smoker presented to the hospital with intermittent     claudication pain of both thigh and buttock region on walking about 5oo m. which of the following is a likely diagnosis?,"a)Arterial disease involving the superficial femoral artery
b)Arterial disease with aortoiliac involvement
c)Femoral venous insufficiency
d)Arterial disease involving the profunda femoris artery","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of arterial disease with aortoiliac involvement. classically, the muscle group affected by claudication is one anatomical level below the level of arterial
disease.
Intermittent claudication is a feature of chronic arterial disease or occlusion of the artery.
Aortoiliac disease affects the infrarenal aorta and iliac arteries.
Management involves smoking cessation, lifestyle modifications, and treatment of underlying diabetes or hyperlipidemia if present.
For claudication, cilostazol or pentoxyfilline is used. cilostazol is superior to pentoxyfilline.
surgical options include aortoiliac bypass, aortobifemoral bypass, percutaneous transluminal
angioplasty (PTA), which can be with or without stent placement, and thromboendarterectomy.

Q4,which of the following statements is true about retrosternal goitre?,"a)operated in all patients regardless of symptoms
b)sternal incision is always required to operate
c)It receives blood supply from the thoracodorsal artery
d)Most of the retrosternal goitres can be removed by a neck incision","Most of the retrosternal goiters can be removed by neck incision (transcervical approach).
Retrosternal goitre is defined as having &gt;5o% of the goiter below the suprasternal notch. It can be either primary or secondary.



• primary: rare and arises from ectopic thyroid tissue in the mediastinum; receives blood supply from intrathoracic blood vessels. It is not related to thyroid tissue in the neck.
• secondary: they are the most common type; an extension of enlarged thyroid from the neck,   usually arising from the lower pole of nodular goitre. It receives its blood supply from superior and inferior thyroid vessels.
The majority of patients are asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms. If the gland enlarges within the thoracic inlet, the pressure may lead to dysphagia, tracheal compression, and
eventually airway symptoms. pemberton sign can be positive (facial flushing and dilatation of cervical veins upon raising the arms above the head).
CECT neck and thorax is the investigation of choice.
over 95% of retrosternal goiters can be removed via a transcervical incision since they are an extension from thyroid tissue in the neck.
other options:
option A: surgical removal of the retrosternal goiter is indicated in patients with significant
airway compression, and in young patients who have symptoms such as dyspnoea or dysphagia.
option B: Median sternotomy approach is indicated in:
• primary mediastinal goiter
• Malignant retrosternal goitre
• very large retrosternal goiter
• Recurrence in the mediastinum
For a primary mediastinal goiter whose boundaries are completely within the chest, resection is often achieved through median sternotomy or thoracotomy to ensure that the vessels supplying the tumor are properly ligated. Removing the tumor through a cervical approach can result in    uncontrolled bleeding and is generally avoided.
option C: Blood supply to the retrosternal goiter is from the thyroid vessels (secondary retrosternal goiter).",,D,

Hinchey's stage?","a)stage 1
b)stage 2
c)stage 3
d)stage 4","Fecal peritonitis belongs to grade 4 in the Hinchey classification.
Diverticulitis refers to the inflammation and infection associated with the diverticula. Hinchey
classification is the most commonly used classification for the severity and complication of acute diverticulitis. It is used additionally to guide the overall management of acute diverticulitis.

Q6,"An 8o-year-old woman presented with complaints of fatigue. on imaging, she was found to
have a scleroatrophic gall bladder with impacted stones in it. A large stone was also present in the common bile duct and the biliary tree is dilated. what is the next step in management?","a)Immediately take up patient for cholecystectomy
b)Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
c)wait and watch
d)CT scan","An 8o-year-old woman with imaging showing a scleroatrophic gall bladder with impacted stones and a stone in the bile duct is suggestive of chronic cholelithiasis with choledocholithiasis. ERCP is the next line of management for this patient.
Choledocholithiasis is the presence of stone in the common bile duct (CBD) or biliary tree. It can be primary or secondary:
• Primary stones are formed in the CBD or biliary tree itself and are rare.
• secondary stones are passed from the gallbladder to the CBD. They are easier to manage than primary stones.
It can be an asymptomatic and incidental finding or present with features such as jaundice (most common), abdominal pain, and fatigue. when there is inflammation of the biliary tree
(cholangitis), the patient will have intermittent pain, fever, and jaundice (Charcot's triad).
Investigations:
• Liver function tests will show elevated direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels.
• Abdominal ultrasound is the first imaging modality done and may show gallstones and dilated bile duct (&gt;8 mm).
• CT is sensitive for CBD stones. It shows stones, location, ductal stricture or block, ductal dilatation, and intrahepatic biliary changes.
• MRCP is highly sensitive and specific for CBD stones, but it is only diagnostic and intervention cannot be performed.
Management:
• ERCP with sphincterotomy is the procedure of choice, followed by the removal of stones using a dormia basket or placement of a stent.
• Despite ERCP being an invasive procedure, it has the advantage of being both a diagnostic and  therapeutic procedure and is more suited for elderly patients who cannot tolerate anesthesia and surgery.
other options:
option A: Cholecystectomy is not recommended for elderly patients, owing to the risk of old age and associated anesthetic and surgical complications.
option C: wait and watch approach can be done for asymptomatic patients, and patients with smaller stones.
option D: CT is sensitive for CBD stones, but it is only diagnostic and intervention cannot be performed.",,B,
Q7,A 35-year-old man presented with recurrent episodes of fever with chills. MRCP image is shown below. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Primary sclerosing cholangitis
b)Caroli disease
c)oriental cholangitis
d)Primary biliary carcinoma","The presence of fever and chills, along with the MRCP showing multiple areas of
intrahepatic beading is typical of primary sclerosing cholangitis.
option B: Caroli's disease is a rare congenital condition characterized by irregular dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts with a normal extrahepatic duct system. It is common in both sexes and
mostly presents before the age of 3o years with abdominal pain, cholangitis, or end-stage liver
disease. MRCP shows irregular, cystic dilation of the large proximal intrahepatic bile ducts with a normal common bile duct.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PsC) is an autoimmune condition characterized by inflammatory   strictures involving the intra and extra-hepatic biliary tree. It is a progressive condition that leads to secondary biliary cirrhosis.
MRCP or ERCP will show demonstrate multifocal, diffuse dilatation and strictures of the
intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary trees, this pattern is a beading or chain of lakes appearance.  Pseudodiverticula of extrahepatic bile ducts are pathognomic of PsC. MRCP is useful in diagnosis and surveillance, while ERCP is reserved for the treatment of dominant strictures and to exclude   malignancy.
The below image shows a cholangiogram of primary sclerosing cholangitis:


The common age group of primary sclerosing cholangitis is 3o-45 years. Men are affected twice as commonly as women. Two-thirds of these cases are associated with ulcerative colitis. It is also
associated with Riedel’s thyroiditis and retroperitoneal fibrosis. 1o–2o% of patients develop cholangiocarcinoma.
Clinical features of a patient with PsC include pruritis, fever, chills, right upper quadrant discomfort, jaundice, and weight loss.
Liver function tests show a cholestatic pattern with an elevation of ALP and GGT and smaller rises in the aminotransferases. Bilirubin values may be variable.
Liver biopsy excludes other causes of cholestatic liver disease and defines the stage of PsC. It shows onion skin concentric periductal fibrosis. with disease progression, periportal fibrosis



occurs, progressing to bridging necrosis, and eventually biliary cirrhosis.
Currently, there is no known effective medical therapy. surgical management involving resection of extrahepatic biliary tree and hepaticojejunostomy has shown reasonable effects. For patients    with advanced liver disease, liver transplantation is the only available option.
other options:
option C: oriental cholangitis, also known as recurrent pyogenic cholangitis is characterized by recurrent attacks of cholangitis due to bile stasis and stone formation. patients between 3o-4o
years and both sexes are equally affected. It is caused due to infections (liver flukes, E.coli,
klebsiella, pseudomonas, and proteus). patients present with Charcot's triad (intermittent fever,   pain, and jaundice). MRCp shows intra or extrahepatic calculi, dilatation of ducts, and strictures. option D: Biliary carcinoma  (cholangiocarcinoma) most commonly affects patients &gt;6o years  and presents with fever, abdominal pain, weight loss, and features of obstructive jaundice. MRCp shows irregular narrowing of the bile duct involved by the tumor, with asymmetric upstream
dilatation of the intrahepatic ducts.",4837-3021.PNG,A,4849-3026.PNG

Q9,The most common neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas is,"a)Gastrinoma
b)Somatostatinoma
c)Insulinoma
d)VIPoma","The most common neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas is insulinoma (4 per million).
Insulinoma is an insulin-producing tumor of the pancreas, with more than 9o% of them being
benign. It occurs in &gt;4o years in patients without MEN 1 syndrome and &lt;4o years in patients with MEN 1. It presents with symptoms of hypoglycemia such as weakness, headaches, sweating,   faintness, seizures, and altered behavior. These occur after fasting or exertion and improve after     glucose intake.
The investigation of choice for insulinoma is the determination of 72-hour fasting
glucose and serum insulin levels. C-peptide and proinsulin levels are also elevated.
Medical management includes:
• Frequent carbohydrate-rich meals
• Somatostatin analogs like octreotide are effective in controlling symptoms due to excess insulin secretion. They should be used with caution as they can suppress counterregulatory hormones,    such as growth hormone (GH), glucagon, and catecholamines, and precipitously worsen
hypoglycemia.
• Diazoxide can be used in the initial management of insulinoma as it inhibits insulin release. Its side effects include sodium retention and nausea.
• Everolimus has been found to be highly effective in improving glycemic control in patients with insulinoma owing to its antitumor effect and induction of insulin resistance.
Enucleation and pancreatectomy are the definitive surgical management of insulinoma.
other options:
option A: Gastrinoma has an incidence of o.5 to 4 in a million.
options B &amp; D: Somatostatinoma and vIPoma are much rarer than gastrinoma.",,C,

Q11,A patient comes with long-standing non-pitting edema in the legs. what is the most probable cause?,"a)Lymphedema
b)Arterial Disorders
c)Venous Disorders
d)coronary heart disease","Lymphedema is the most probable cause of long-standing non-pitting edema in the limbs.
Lymphedema is the abnormal accumulation of protein-rich fluid in the interstitial spaces of the tissues.
Lymphedema can be primary or secondary.
primary lymphedema includes:
• Lymphedema congenita (o-2 years): more common in males, involves multiple limbs, face, and genitalia. It can be familial or sporadic. The familial type is called Nonne Milroy syndrome.
• Lymphedema praecox (2-35 years): more common in females, the most common type of primary lymphedema with a peak incidence in puberty. It can be familial or sporadic. The familial type is    called Meig's disease.
• Lymphedema tarda (&gt;35 years): Rare and uncommon.
secondary lymphedema is more common than primary and is the most common cause of lymphedema overall. causes include lymph node dissection (axillary or inguinal),
post-mastectomy, postoperative radiotherapy, obesity, varicose vein surgery, and trauma.
complications of lymphedema include infections, skin changes, recurent cellulitis, non-healing ulcers, and lymphangiosarcoma.
Treatment mostly includes patient education and nonsurgical interventions, which include limb elevation, and external compressive garments. when the above methods fail, surgery can be
considered.",,A,

Q14,True statement about intermittent claudication:,"a)Felt at rest
b)Most commonly felt in the calf muscles
c)Day to day distance is variable
d)Relived after getting out of bed","Intermittent claudication is most commonly felt in the calf muscles because of the involvement of the superficial femoral artery in chronic vascular occlusive disease.
Intermittent claudication:
• Intermittent claudication is the debilitating cramp-like pain felt in the leg muscles due to reduced blood flow and anaerobic metabolism brought on by peripheral arterial disease.
• It usually signifies mild to moderate chronic vascular occlusive disease
• The pain is brought on by walking (option D)
• Not present on taking the first step
• Relieved by rest in both the standing and sitting positions, usually within 5 minutes (option A).



• The distance that a patient is able to walk without stopping is known as claudication distance. It varies only slightly from day to day (option C).
• The superficial femoral artery (7o%) is the most commonly affected artery by claudication and manifests as pain in the calf muscles.
• Aorto-iliac occlusion may cause thigh or buttock claudication. Leriche's syndrome occurs due to aortoiliac occlusion and presents with a triad of claudication, impotence, and absent femoral
pulses.
Boyd's classification of claudication:
• Grade I: patient complains of pain after walking. If the patient continues to walk, due to
increased blood flow in muscle and opening of collaterals metabolites causing pain are washed away and the pain subsides.
• Grade II: pain still persists on continuing to walk; but can walk with effort.
• Grade III: The patient has to take rest to relieve the pain.",,B,

b)surgery is indicated if aneurysmal diameter is &gt;55mm
c)urgently wheel the patient to OT for surgery
d)surgery is indicated only if aneurysm is &gt;77mm","surgery is indicated in an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) only if its diameter is more than 55 mm in a male patient.
If the diameter is less than 55 mm, regular ultrasound monitoring is required. This is because
elective open surgery has a higher rate of mortality when compared to conservative management for aneurysms of size &lt; 55 mm.
Indications for surgery in abdominal aortic aneurysm:
• size &gt;5.5 cm in males
• size &gt;5 cm in females
• Expansion of &gt;1 cm in one year
• painful tender aneurysm
• Thrombosed aneurysm; aneurysm with distal emboli
Management of aortic aneurysm: AAA is surgically managed by dacron graft repair. It can be either open or EVAR (endovascular aneurysm repair)



• open surgical repair is done by exposing the aorta through a mid-sternal incision and graft
replacement. To expose the aorta the descending colon should be mobilized medially and this is known as left visceral rotation or Mattox procedure.
• EVAR is a minimally invasive procedure in which an aortic stent graft is placed on the nonaneurysmal aortoiliac segment.
complications following an AAA repair are:
• cardiovascular (ischemia and infarction)
• Respiratory (atelectasis or consolidation).
• colonic ischemia.
• Renal failure.
• Aortoduodenal fistula

Q17,which of the following is the Miami criteria for intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) measurement?,"a)Quarter fall in 5 min
b)Quarter fall in 1o min
c)Half fall in 5 min
d)Half fall in 1o min","A drop in the level of PTH to less than half the maximum value (corresponding to the preoperative levels)  at 1o min postresection is the Miami criteria.
It is used to determine the extent of resection of the parathyroid gland which is done in a case of primary hyperparathyroidism due to adenoma.
Intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring is a commonly used adjunct, which guides the surgeon on when to stop parathyroid exploration and helps in confirming there is no residual   hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue. The PTH levels are expected to drop after the gland is
excised due to its short half-life (3-5 minutes). Blood is drawn at various time points and the hormone levels are assessed.



Based on the Miami Criteria, a more than 5o% decline in PTH at 1o minutes following
parathyroid gland removal compared to the highest baseline level, either the pre-incision or pre-excision, suggests a cure, and the procedure can be terminated.
Indications for parathyroidectomy:
All symptomatic patients with hyperparathyroidism should be offered surgery. Indications for surgery in asymptomatic patients include:

Q18,"A 15-year-old boy undergoes bilateral adrenalectomy for phaeochromocytoma. on the third   postoperative day, the boy feels lethargic and tired. Blood pressure is 8o/6o mm Hg, there is no sign of bleed. what could be the cause of this?","a)Addisonian crisis
b)SIADH
c)Diabetes insipidus
d)cerebral salt wasting disease","The given clinical scenario of hypotension with no presence of bleeding and bilateral
adrenalectomy is suggestive of an Addisonian crisis. It is a life-threatening condition caused due to sudden insufficiency of adrenal hormones.
Acute adrenal insufficiency (adrenal or addisonian's crisis) is a medical emergency caused due to a precipitating illness unmasking insufficiency or trauma or severe sepsis causing adrenal
hemorrhage (waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome) or surgical removal of the glands. It presents with non-specific symptoms such as shock with fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
hypocalcemia and electrolyte imbalances. It may be often misdiagnosed as an acute abdominal emergency.
Adrenal insufficiency can be primary (due to adrenal pathology), secondary (due to pituitary pathology- lack of ACTH) or tertiary (due to hypothalamus pathology- lack of CRH).
Autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency worldwide. Tuberculosis is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in India.
Adrenal crisis requires immediate intervention owing to its high mortality rate. Immediate
rehydration is initiated with a saline infusion at 1 litre/hr with continuous cardiac monitoring.
Glucocorticoid replacement is initiated with an initial bolus injection of hydrocortisone 1oo mg
followed by 2oo mg over 24 hours, preferably by continuous infusion or alternatively by IV or IM



injections. Mineralocorticoid replacement is initiated once the daily dose of hydrocortisone has

Q20,"A middle-aged man presented to the emergency department with upper abdominal pain after having a heavy meal. on clinical examination, upper abdominal tenderness was noted. on
chest radiography widening of the mediastinum with pneumomediastinum was seen. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)Spontaneous perforation of esophagus
b)perforation of peptic ulcer
c)Foreign body in esophagus
d)Rupture of emphysematous bulla of lung","The clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of spontaneous perforation of the esophagus.
In a perforated peptic ulcer, patients develop sudden onset severe generalized abdominal pain,
tenderness, and board-like rigidity and an erect plain chest X-ray shows gas under the diaphragm (option B). The foreign body in the esophagus can be asymptomatic or may present with
perforation after ingestion. The radiopaque foreign body can be seen with a chest X-ray (option c).  Rupture of emphysematous bullae of the lung will lead to secondary pneumothorax, which   manifests as chest pain and dyspnoea. A plain chest X-ray shows air in the thorax, and the
mediastinum is pushed to the opposite side (option D).
spontaneous perforation of the esophagus needs immediate diagnosis and intervention due to the higher mortality associated with it. The most common site of perforation is the lower esophagus    towards the left esophageal cavity.
causes:
• Iatrogenic perforation (most common)
• Boerhaave's syndrome (spontaneous emetogenic perforation)
• sharp foreign body
• corrosive ingestion



• Esophageal carcinoma
It usually manifests as severe pain in the chest or abdomen after a meal or after a bout of
drinking, commonly associated with dyspnoea. on clinical examination, there is rigidity and
tenderness in the upper abdomen. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by a chest radiograph which shows pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, and pneumothorax. Subcutaneous emphysema   can be seen in Boerhaave's syndrome. patients with sepsis will have a fever, tachycardia and
tachypnea.
Treatment includes adequate drainage, antibiotics, closure of the perforation site if possible and supportive measures.",,A,
Q21,"A 32-year-old male was diagnosed with achalasia cardia. High-resolution manometry revealed massive, simultaneous, high-pressure contractions of the distal oesophagus. According to the
■chicago classification, the patient has which type of achalasia?","a)Type II
b)Type I
c)Type IV
d)Type III","The given features are suggestive of type III achalasia cardia.
Type III achalasia cardia is characterised by massive, simultaneous, high-pressure contractions of the distal esophagus.
Achalasia cardia occurs due to the loss of inhibitory ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus of GIT. During swallowing, the food bolus normally triggers a primary peristaltic wave, which is
responsible for carrying the bolus to the stomach, accompanied by the relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to allow esophageal emptying into the stomach.
Achalasia is characterized by a disruption of this normal process. Failure of relaxation of the LES causes an elevated median integrated relaxation pressure and a complete failure of
peristalsis. The esophagus becomes progressively more tortuous, leading to a megaesophagus.",,D,

Q24,which of the following should be the treatment of choice for renal cell carcinoma with tumor less than 4 cm in size?,"a)partial nephrectomy
b)partial nephrectomy + neoadjuvant chemotherapy
c)Radical nephrectomy
d)Radical nephrectomy + postoperative radiotherapy","partial nephrectomy (also known as nephron-sparing surgery) is the treatment of choice for tumors &lt;4 cm.
Indications for partial nephrectomy:
• Tumors &lt; 4cm
• well-selected tumors between 4-7 cm
• Bilateral tumors
• Tumor in solitary kidneys
• patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction.
Recently, partial nephrectomy is also increasingly being performed for stage T1b tumors.
Treatment of renal cell carcinoma:
RCC is a radio and chemoresistant tumor.
Radical nephrectomy consists of the removal of the kidney, perirenal fat, adrenal gland, and
regional lymph nodes. The adrenal gland is no longer removed except in cases of obvious tumor    involvement. Lymphadenectomy is indicated only in high-risk patients with large primary tumors and enlarged lymph nodes.
Cryoablation is indicated in the T1a stage of RCC if surgery cannot be performed. It is also indicated in advanced/metastatic tumors.
Note: sunitinib and sorafenib are also used in GIsT and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Q25,"A 38-year-old man was brought to the emergency department after suffering a stab injury to   the lower chest. on presentation, he had bradycardia and hypotension which did not improve despite IV fluid administration. Chest radiography showed clear lung fields. what is the next  step in management?","a)eFAST
b)Tube thoracostomy
c)CECT chest
d)CECT abdomen","The given clinical scenario of a patient with a stab injury and hypotension not responding to IV fluids indicates persistent hypotension due to ongoing hemorrhage and the next step in the
management is to perform an eFAST.
Cardiogenic shock or hemorrhagic shock are the most likely causes of persistent hypotension in a trauma patient. ultrasound evaluation using eFAST to look for pericardium, pleural cavities, and  abdomen in combination with plain radiographs of the chest and pelvis will usually identify the    source of the bleed.
In patients with persistent hypotension due to blunt trauma, the pelvis should be wrapped in a sheet for stabilization until radiography can be done.
Evaluation of CVp or ultrasound ofthe IVC may further assist in distinguishing between cardiogenic and hypovolemic shock.
It is mostly fatal if not controlled, and requires immediate management. Blood and plasma
transfusions are provided in a ratio of 2:1. patients with persistent hypotension requiring surgical intervention include:
• Blunt trauma and massive hemothorax
• penetrating trauma
• Hemoperitoneum
• Gunshot injuries to the chest or abdomen
• penetrating weapon remaining in place.
other options:
options C and D: CECT can be done only when the patient is hemodynamically stable.
option B: Tube thoracostomy has no role in this patient's management since the X-ray shows clear lung fields.",,A,
Q26,"A man was brought to the emergency department after he fell into a manhole and injured his  perineum. He gets an urge to micturate but is unable to urinate. on examination, blood was    seen at the tip of the urethra, and swelling of the penis and scrotum was seen. what is the site of injury?","a)Membranous urethra rupture
b)Bulbar urethra injury
c)prostatic urethra injury
d)urinary bladder rupture","The given clinical scenario with a history of a blow to the perineum, blood at the tip of the meatus, swelling of the penis and scrotum is suggestive of an injury to the bulbar urethra.
urethral injuries can be classified into:



Note: urinary bladder rupture occurs due to an injury to the suprapubic region. Extraperitoneal bladder rupture is more common and associated with pelvic fracture. Intraperitoneal bladder
rupture is caused by a blow or a fall on a distended bladder. It manifests as sudden severe pain in the hypogastrium and syncope.
