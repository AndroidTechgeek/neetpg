Q1,which of the following layers is affected in salter Harris type 1 fracture?,"a)Through the whole of epiphysis
b)Resting zone of the growth plate
c)calcific layer of the growth plate
d)Mineralisation zone",salter Harris type 1 fracture is a transverse fracture through the hypertrophic or calci■ed zone of the growth plate. The growing zone of the physis is usually not injured and growth disturbance is uncommon.,,C,
Q2,"A 75 year old man presents with fracture of intracapsular neck of femur. what is the ""standard of care"" management done for this patient?","a)Boot and bar cast
b)Russell's traction
c)Intramedullary nailing
d)Hemiarthroplasty","In patients over 65 years old with an intracapsular neck of femur fracture and a normal hip otherwise, hemiarthroplasty is the standard management approach.
Reduction and ■xation of fractures in the elderly patient is not recommended due to the
associated high rates of subsequent reoperation , non-union and osteonecrosis of the femoral
head. In young patients presenting with fracture within 3 weeks, closed reduction internal fixation with cannulated cancellous screws is performed.
Bipolar hip prosthesis is preferred as it has 2 articulating sites. Austin Moore and Thompson
prosthesis are also used. If the patient has pre exixting hip conditions like osteoarthritis, total hip replacement is preferred.",,D,
Q3,what is the diagnosis of the following X Ray?,"a)Tibial condylar fracture
b)Rheumatoid arthritis
c)patellar fracture
d)Hemarthrosis","The X-ray shows a transverse fracture of the patella.
The patient presents with pain and swelling over the affected knee. patellar tenderness and bruise over the front of the joint can be present. crepitus may be felt in comminuted fractures. The
patient cannot lift his leg in full extension(extension lag) due to the disruption of the extensor apparatus. Hemarthrosis can be associated.
patellar fractures can be transverse, longitudinal, polar, or comminuted.
The radiological examination includes Ap and lateral views. A skyline view of the patella is required in some cases of undisplaced fractures.
Management of patellar fractures:
• undisplaced fractures: It is treated with a plaster cast extending from the groin to just above the malleoli, with the knee in full extension. This is called a cylinder cast and is usually left in place
for a period of at least 3 weeks
• A transverse fracture is treated by a surgical procedure consisting of the reduction of the
fragments known as tension-band wiring and K- wire fixation. This is followed by the repair of the extensor retinacula and physiotherapy.
• comminuted fractures are treated by open reduction and fixation. patellectomy  is the preferred option in this case as restoration of a smooth articular surface is difficult in this condition.
patella-saving operations are recently more performed with advancements in fixation techniques.
• Longitudinal fractures usually have intact extensor apparatus. They can be treated with a cylinder cast or extension brace initially, followed by a range of motion.",5457-3478.PNG,C,
Q4,A 22 year old came with thigh pain. X ray was done as shown below. what is the diagnosis?,"a)osteosarcoma
b)osteomalacia
c)chronic osteomyelitis
d)Ewings sarcoma","The given clinical scenario of a patient with thigh pain and an X-ray of the lower limb revealing involucrum and cloaca in the femur, strongly suggests a diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis.
chronic osteomyelitis may occur by direct inoculation of the infective organism during trauma (like road traffic accidents). The infection continues to thrive within the bone leading to
alternating quiescent and flare-up stages of chronic osteomyelitis.
sequestrum is a piece of dead bone. It is formed when a fragment of bone gets separated from the healthy bone due to necrosis. It varies in size from a spicule to a large fragment and acts as a
nidus for infection. It leads to abscess and persistent pus discharge in the bone. sinus tracts are formed when the abscess from the infected bone drains out through the skin.
The involucrum is the dense new sclerotic bone surrounding the sequestrum. It is formed from   deep layers of stripped periosteum. cloacae are the perforations in the involucrum. pus and tiny spicules of bone may be discharged through them.
The radiograph below shows sequestrum, involucrum and cloacae:",5458-3479.PNG,C,5463-3481.PNG
Q5,"out of the following, which is the most common site of osteoporotic fracture?","a)vertebral fracture
b)Glenoid fracture
c)subtrochanteric fracture
d)Mid shaft of humerus","out of the following options, vertebral fractures are most commonly seen in osteoporosis
The fractures are classically low trauma de■ned as a fall from standing height or less. Fracture
ofthe distal radius (colles’ fracture) is usually the ■rst fracture to occur, followed by vertebrae and hip unless treatment is initiated. osteoporotic vertebral fractures are particularly dif■cult to
diagnose as they may be clinically silent.  In severe cases, signi■cant height loss (often exceeding 4 cm)and thoracic kyphosis can occur due to multiple vertebral fractures.
osteoporosis is a common metabolic bone disease characterized by a diffuse reduction in bone   density due to a decrease in bone mass. A DEXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan is the investigation of choice for the diagnosis and assessment of severity.
The mainstay of treatment is to reduce the risk of fractures. The following medications can be useful in the treatment:
• Bisphosphonates - They are the first line of medication. They reduce osteoclastic bone resorption and prevent bone loss. Eg. zoledronate.
• Denosumab - This is an antibody to the RANK ligand. It prevents the activation of RANK which is required for the proliferation of osteoclasts. Therefore, it decreases bone resorption.
• parathyroid hormone - Teriparatide is a recombinant parathyroid hormone analog. At low and intermittent doses, they can promote bone formation.
• selective estrogen receptor modulators (sERMs) - They act on the estrogen receptors and prevent bone resorption. Eg. raloxifene.
• strontium ranelate - It is thought to increase bone formation and reduce bone resorption.",,A,
Q6,A 7o yr old female presents with extracapsular neck of femur fracture. what is the best step in management?,"a)Russell's traction
b)Interlocking plate
c)Dynamic hip screw
d)Boot and bar cast","Intertrochanteric fractures are the most common type of extracapsular fracture. Dynamic hip screw is the managament for undisplaced intertrochanteric fractures.
In elderly patients, internal fixation is preferred because inthem prolonged bed rest in traction may cause complications related to recumbency i.e., bed sores, pneumonia etc.
Intertrochanteric fractures of the femur can be treated by:
• Extramedullary implants - dynamic hip screw
• Intramedullary implants - proximal femoral nail and gamma nail.
Dynamic hip screws are used in undisplaced intertrochanteric fractures, whereas proximal femoral nails are used in displaced intertrochanteric fractures.



conservative methods like Russels traction or skeleton traction in Thomas splint are nowadays not preferred due to the success rate of operative methods.",,C,5464-3483.PNG;5464-3482.PNG
Q7,A 26 year old female presented with proximal one-third fracture of shaft of femur. what is the treatment of choice ?,"a)Intramedullary nailing
b)Above knee slab
c)Hip spica
d)Above knee cast","closed intramedullary nail with interlocking screws is the preferred treatment of most femoral shaft fractures.
Newer technique uses Gross-kempf nails which have perforations at the proximal and distal ends to be locked in place, using transverse screws. Thus, it ensures stability, prevents rotation of the     fractured fragments and telescoping of the implant.
In modern practice, conservative treatments like traction, bracing, and spica casts are rarely used. Traction can reduce and maintain alignment in most fractures, except for those in the upper third of the femur. Joint mobility can be preserved through active exercises. However, the major
drawback is the extended bed rest required (1o–14 weeks for adults), which makes it difficult to keep the femur aligned long enough for callus formation and can lead to increased patient
discomfort and frustration.
After surgery, full weight-bearing should be commenced as soon as the ■xation allows. The
fracture usually heals within 2o weeks and the complication rate is low; sometimes malunion or delayed union occur.

Q8,All of the following statements regarding ankylosing spondylitis are true except?,"a)Most commonly seen between the age of 2o to 4o.
b)Affects males more than females
c)In 85-95% patients, HLA-B27 is positive
d)Non Erosive arthritis of the joint with sclerosis is seen","The cardinal and the earliest sign of ankylosing spondylitis is erosion of the sacroiliac joints. Later there may be periarticular sclerosis, especially on the iliac side of the joint and ■nally bony
ankylosis
Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the spine and sacroiliac joint. It is more common in young males and has a strong association with HLAB27. Males are affected
more frequently than females and the usual age at onset is between 15 and 25 years. clinically,  patients present with recurring backache which worsens in the early morning or with inactivity and improves with exercise. Later they develop fatigue, pain, joint swellings, and heel pain.



Extra-articular manifestations include anterior uveitis, aortic valve insufficiency, heart blocks, and pulmonary fibrosis. Examination findings include loss of lumbar lordosis, increased thoracic
kyphosis, diminished spinal movements, and decreased chest expansion.
The EsR and CRp are usually elevated during active phases ofthe disease. HLA-B27 is present in 95% of cases. serological tests for rheumatoid factor are usually negative
X-ray findings:
• Erosion of sacroiliac joints- earliest sign
• periarticular sclerosis in later stages
• squaring of vertebrae due to the flattening of normal anterior concavity of the vertebral body is the earliest vertebral change
• Bamboo spine appearance due to bridging of adjacent vertebrae
• wedging of the vertebra leading to hyperkyphosis
Treatment consists of maintaining posture and preserving mobility. pain and stiffness can be
controlled with anti-inflammatory drugs. In severe cases, TNF inhibitors are used. surgery can be considered to correct the deformity.
option D: Non erosive arthritis is a feature of systemic lupus erythematosus (sLE).",,D,
Q9,"A 6o-year-old female comes with complaint of unable to bear weight following trivial trauma.
X ray of hip and leg is given. what is the diagnosis?","a)Brown tumor
b)Disseminated TB
c)Eosinophilic granulomas
d)Metastasis","The given scenario of a 6o-year-old female with trivial trauma unable to bear weight and X ray findings suggestive of destruction of the hip joint and periarticular bone and shaft of the tibia   fracture is most likely due to metastasis.
Its more likely this patient has metastasis because:
• Age: 6o-year (old age favors cancer)
• overall bone denisty is normal
pathological fractures are fractures that occur in a weakened bone that has structurally changed due to some condition. They occur either spontaneously or due to minor trauma. The features    suggestive of a pathological fracture include:
• pain at the site before the fracture
• Multiple recent fractures
• Elderly patient
• History of primary malignancy
• unusual fracture pattern (Banana fracture - transverse fracture through an abnormal area of bone, similar to breaking a segment from a banana)





other options:
option A: Brown tumor: seen in hyperparathyroidism. X-rays show lytic lesions, but this is rare and typically involves long-standing disease in younger patients. Focal osteoblastic activity.
overall bone denisty is low.
option B: Disseminated TB: pott’s disease or monoarticular destruction (e.g., hip or spine). Hip   joint is usually destroyed and articular surface erosion is present. Disseminated TB rarely causes widespread fractures. Here there is no joint involvement.
option C: Eosinophilic granulomas: Typically seen in younger individuals (children/young adults). X-rays reveal punched-out lesions, not diffuse destruction.",5460-3480.PNG,D,5467-3485.PNG
Q10,A 4o-year-old male comes with an intracapsular fracture of the femur. what is the surgery of choice?,"a)open reduction internal fixation
b)closed reduction internal fixation
c)Hemiarthroplasty
d)Total arthroplasty","Closed reduction internal fixation is the surgery of choice for a 4o-year-old patient with an intracapsular fracture of the femur.
A displaced fracture neck of the femur in an adult who is physiologically less than 65 years of age is best treated by closed reduction and internal fixation with multiple cannulated cancellous
screws. open reduction is only done if closed reduction fails, as the complication rate is higher.
proximal femur fractures are classified based on their location near the hip joint. The main types include:
• Intracapsular Fractures:: It occurs within the joint capsule and involves the femoral neck and head.
subtypes:
• Femoral head fracture
• Femoral neck fracture (common site for avascular necrosis and non-union).
2. Extracapsular Fractures: occur outside the joint capsule.



subtypes:
• Intertrochanteric fracture: Between the greater and lesser trochanters.
• subtrochanteric fracture: Below the lesser trochanter.
• Trochanteric fracture: Isolated fracture of the greater or lesser trochanter.
Management of Intracapsular Fractures depends on the age of the patient:
1. &gt; 65 years: Replacement - Hemi/Total Replacement (option C and D)
2. &lt; 65 years: is based on duration of fracture
• &lt;3 weeks- CRIF with cannulated cancellous screws (avoid hematoma)
• &gt;3 weeks- Check the viability of head- further management depends on the viability of head",,B,
Q11,FRAX is related to?,"a)Fracture risk assessment
b)Fracture rehabilitation assessment
c)Fracture repair assessment
d)Fracture reduction assessment","FRAX is related to Fracture risk assessment.
It is used to predict the risk of fracture in a person with osteoporosis within the next 1o years. It is used to recommend treatment or suggest ways of preventing osteoporosis.
The FRAX tool can be used to guide treatment decisions in people who meet the following three conditions:
• postmenopausal women or men age 5o and older.
• people with low bone density (osteopenia).
• people who have not taken an osteoporosis medicine.",,A,
