As the tip of the coccyx is the closest option relating to the spine , it can be the most appropriate answer.
The ischial spine is a bony prominence found on the ischium. The interspinous distance is the distance between the tip of two ischial spines.

Q11,which of the following statements is true concerning the anatomy of the breast?,"a) Inner quadrants contain most breast tissue
b) Ligaments of cooper are found only in lower quadrants
c) Tail of spence extends across anterior axillary fold
d) Breast is made of 1o lobes","The tail of spence extends across the anterior axillary fold and is a small extension of the upper lateral quadrant of the breast.
The breast lies in the superficial fascia of the pectoral region. A small extension of the upper lateral quadrant, called the axillary tail of spence, passes through an opening in the deep fascia and lies in the axilla.
The upper outer quadrant of the breast contains a greater volume of tissue than the other quadrants. This is the reason for the majority of the carcinomas arising in the upper outer quadrant.
The suspensory ligaments (Cooper’s ligaments) are often well-developed in the superior parts of the breast.
The breasts normally comprise up to 2o discrete lobes.",,C,388-403.PNG

d) parotid duct","Lower lip paralysis is caused by damage to the cervical branch of the facial nerve.
The cervical branch of the facial nerve is responsible for innervating the platysma muscle, which is one of the muscles involved in the movements of the lower lip. Damage to this nerve can potentially lead to paralysis of the lower lip.
The facial nerve is the motor nerve of the face. Its five terminal branches emerge from the parotid gland: Temporal, zygomatic, Buccal, Marginal mandibular, Cervical.",,B,389-404.PNG

An aberrant right subclavian artery occurs when the right fourth aortic arch and right dorsal aorta involute cranial to the seventh intersegmental artery.
This artery arises distal to the left subclavian artery and crosses the midline posterior to the esophagus. Most patients with this anomaly are asymptomatic. Dysphagia caused by compression of the esophagus by an abnormal subclavian artery is called dysphagia lusoria.",372-390.PNG,C,390-406.PNG

b) Levator labii superioris
c) zygomaticus major
d) orbicularis oris","This patient, recovering from facial nerve palsy, getting food stuck between the cheek and teeth while eating, is because of the buccinator being affected.
The buccinator is a muscle of facial expression. It is innervated by the facial nerve. It is known as the whistling muscle.
The buccinator muscle is primarily responsible for keeping food between the teeth during mastication by pressing the cheek against the teeth.
In facial nerve palsy, paralysis of the buccinator muscle can lead to food accumulating in the cheek pouch.",,A,
Q17,which of the following is not a derivative of neural crest cells?,"a) ciliary muscles
b) Retinal pigment epithelium
c) ciliary ganglion
d) Melanocytes","Retinal pigment epithelium is not a derivative of neural crest cells.
Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is derived from the neuroectoderm. The RPE develops from the outer layer of the optic cup, a structure that arises from the neural tube (neuroectodermal origin), not from neural crest cells.
Neural crest cells are a group of cells that migrate during embryonic development and give rise to various structures, including parts of the nervous system, face, and heart. Derivatives include melanocytes, sensory ganglia, sympathetic neurons, Schwann cells, adrenal medulla cells, craniofacial skeleton, ciliary ganglion, and ciliary muscles.",,B,
Q18,The cranial component of the neural crest cells leads to the formation of?,"a) SA node
b) AV cushion
c) conotruncal septum
d) chordae tendinae","The cranial component of neural crest cells (Ncc) leads to the formation of conotruncal septum.
The conotruncal septum is also known as the aortopulmonary septum. The formation of the aortopulmonary septum in the truncus arteriosus divides the outflow channel of the heart into the ventral aorta and the pulmonary trunk.
other options:
option A: SA node is derived from the primary heart field - sinus venosus.
option B: AV cushions are derived from adjacent endocardial cells.
option D: chordae tendineae are formed from mesenchymal tissue within the heart.",,C,394-408.PNG
Q19,"A 15-year-old boy underwent splenectomy for immune thrombocytopenic purpura. During the procedure, the surgeon noticed bleeding while separating the spleen from the stomach. which vessels are most likely implicated in this bleeding?","a) Left gastric vessels
b) short gastric vessels
c) Right gastro-epiploic vessels
d) splenic vessels","This patient, undergoing splenectomy, while separating the spleen from the stomach, is likely bleeding from the short gastric vessels.
In an open splenectomy, the gastrosplenic ligament is opened and short gastric vessels are ligated and divided.
The spleen is attached to the stomach through the gastrosplenic ligament. Contents of the gastrosplenic ligament include: short gastric vessels and Left gastroepiploic vessels.
Hence, while separating the spleen from the stomach, there are maximum chances of bleeding if there is injury to the short gastric vessels.",,B,395-409.PNG
Q20,Identify the marked structure,"a) primitive streak
b) Notochord
c) Neural groove
d) secondary neural plate","The marked structure is the primitive streak.
The primitive streak appears in the early stages of gastrulation, a process that reorganizes the epiblast into three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. It appears as a linear thickening on the dorsal surface of the epiblast in the bilaminar embryonic disc.
Functions of the primitive streak:
• serves as the site where cells migrate inward to form the mesoderm and endoderm.
• Marks the beginning of gastrulation.
• Defines the body axis (head-to-tail, left-to-right).",375-393.PNG,A,396-411.PNG
Q21,which of the following is the first to be formed by the migration of the epiblast along the primitive streak?,"a) Endoderm
b) cardiac mesoderm
c) Epidermis
d) Neural groove","Endoderm is the first to be formed by the migration of the epiblast along the primitive streak.
Gastrulation is when the single-layered blastula reorganizes into a multi-layered structure called the gastrula. During gastrulation, epiblast cells migrate through the primitive streak to form the three primary germ layers.
The first group of migrating epiblast cells replaces the hypoblast to form the definitive endoderm. Subsequent migrating cells spread between the epiblast and the newly formed endoderm to create the mesoderm. Remaining epiblast cells that do not migrate through the primitive streak form the ectoderm.",,A,397-412.PNG
Q22,"During walking, the hip bone on the side of the suspended leg is raised by the action of which muscle present in the supporting leg?","a) Gluteus Medius
b) Gluteus Maximus
c) obdurator Internus
d) Quadratus Femoris","Gluteus Medius of the supporting leg is responsible for raising the hip bone on the side of the suspended leg.
Actions of Gluteus Medius: Hip abduction, stabilizes the pelvis during gait, Assists the internal rotation of the thigh.
Trendelenburg sign is a clinical sign used to assess the function of the gluteus medius. It is positive when the pelvis drops on the opposite side of the stance leg, indicating weakness or dysfunction of the gluteus medius on the supporting leg.",,A,398-413.PNG
Q23,Identify the marked structure?,"a) oculomotor nerve
b) Abducens nerve
c) Trochlear nerve
d) ophthalmic division","The structure shown in the above image is the oculomotor nerve. The oculomotor nerve (CN III) passes through the superior orbital fissure, which lies within the region of the cavernous sinus.",376-394.PNG,A,399-415.PNG
Q24,Injury to the posterior interosseous nerve leads to?,"a) Loss of extension of digits
b) Loss of extension of the wrist
c) Loss of supination
d) wrist drop","Injury to the posterior interosseous nerve leads to loss of extension of digits.
The posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) is a continuation of the deep branch of the radial nerve. It is purely a motor nerve and supplies the posterior compartment of the forearm.
Clinical correlation: Monteggia fracture involves a fracture of the proximal ulna with a dislocation of the radial head. The radial nerve, especially its posterior interosseous branch, is at risk due to its proximity to the fracture site and leads to loss of extension of digits.",nan,A,nan
