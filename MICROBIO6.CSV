option D: Paul-Bunnell test is the investigation of choice for infectious mononucleosis.",,B,
Q3,"A patient presents with gastrointestinal problems including abdominal pain and distension, bloody and mucus-filled diarrhea, and tenesmus, with rectal prolapse. A stool examination   reveals the presence of typical barrel-shaped eggs. what is the possible causative agent?","a)Giardia lamblia
b)Trichuris trichiura
c)Ascaris lumbricoides
d)Ancylostoma duodenale","The given clinical picture and the barrel-shaped eggs are suggestive of infection with Trichuris trichiura (whipworm).
The characteristic features of whipworm eggs are:
• Eggs are barrel-shaped in the middle with a projecting mucus plug at each pole containing an unsegmented ovum. The plugs are colorless.
• They float in the saturated salt solution.
• It has a triple shell, the outermost layer of which is stained brown.
The below image shows the egg of Trichuris trichiura.



In moderate infections of 2o adult worms or less, the worms are confined to the caecum and   ascending colon. The symptoms include epigastric and lower abdominal pain, diarrhea (rarely bloody), vomiting, flatulence and distention, weight loss, and increased blood and iron loss.
In heavy infections of 2oo adults worms or more (trichuris dysentery syndrome), the worms are in the distal colon and rectum. The symptoms include bloody diarrhea with profuse mucus,
abdominal pain, tenesmus, weight loss leading to cachexia, severe anemia, and rectal prolapse. on examination, clubbing may be present. Blood investigations may show moderate eosinophilia.
Chronic infection leads to growth retardation and nutritional deficiencies. Around o.oo5 ml of   blood is lost per day per worm. In heavy infections, as much as 4 to 5 ml can be lost per day per worm.
Treatment is mebendazole or albendazole.",,B,1466-891.PNG
Q4,Viral infection mimicking erythroblastosis fetalis is:,"a)HSV
b)Epstein-Barr virus
c)picornavirus
d)parvovirus B19","parvovirus B19 infection mimics erythroblastosis fetalis.
parvovirus B19, belonging to the parvovirus group consisting of the smallest animal DNA viruses,  primarily infect immature cells of the erythroid lineage. It is associated with erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), transient aplastic crisis, pure red cell aplasia and hydrops fetalis.
During pregnancy, infection with parvovirus B19 can lead to severe anemia, non-immune hydrops fetalis and fetal death. This is because parvovirus preferentially infects RBC progenitor cells. This  mimics erythroblastosis fetalis, in which maternal antibodies against fetal RBCs cause varying
degrees of anemia and immune-mediated hydrops fetalis in sever cases.
picornavirus, Epstein-Barr virus and HSV infections do not mimic erythroblastosis fetalis.",,D,
Q5,"An 11-year-old boy was brought to the pediatric OpD with multiple abscesses over his face,

b)The action of MHC II occurs via endocytic pathway
c)MHC Class II presents endogenous antigens
d)MHC II is present on antigen presenting cells",MHC class II presents exogenous antigens while MHC class I presents endogenous antigens.,,C,1468-893.PNG
Q8,which of the following investigations does not use antibody marking?,"a)ELISA
b)Radioimmunoassay
c)Immunofluorescence
d)Hemagglutination","The hemagglutination test is not based on the principle of antibody marking.
In tests based on the principle of antibody marking, the antigens or antibodies are labelled or
marked with enzymes, fluorescent dyes, radioisotopes etc. In radioimmunoassay, fixed amounts     of antibody and radiolabelled antigen react in the presence of unlabelled antigen. The labelled and unlabelled antigens compete for binding sites on the antibody. Thus, the concentration of the test  antigen can be calculated from the ratio of the bound and total antigen counts using a standard
dose-response curve. In immunofluorescence, fluorescent dyes are conjugated to antibodies or
antigens. The labelled antibodies or antigens can then be used to identify antigens and antibodies, respectively. In ELISA, an adsorbing material - cellulose, agarose, polystyrene, polyvinvyl etc - is    used to bind to either antigens or antibodies.
when antibodies bind to antigens on the surface of red blood cells, the resultant clumping
reaction is referred to as hemagglutination. It is routinely performed to type red blood cells in ABO blood-typing. The image below shows hemagglutination.



Note: If no hemagglutination occurs it means the patient’s serum has anti-haemagglutinin
antibodies that bind to hemagglutinin and prevent the clumping reaction. This hemagglutination inhibition reaction is a method of detection of viruses and antiviral-antibodies and is used to
make a diagnosis of influenza.",,D,1469-894.PNG
Q9,A 3-year-old child presents with a history of repeated sinopulmonary infections caused by encapsulated organisms. which of the following is most likely to be deficient in this case?,"a)IgG1
b)IgG2
c)IgG3
d)IgG4","Deficiency of IgG2 results in recurrent sinopulmonary infections with encapsulated organisms.
IgG is the only maternal immunoglobulin that is normally transported across the placenta and  provides natural passive immunity to the newborn. IgG1 is the antibody maximally transported across the placenta, whereas IgG2 has the least transplacental movement.
Deficiencies of other IgG:
• IgG1- bacterial infections (diphtheria, tetanus)(option A)
• IgG3- viral infections (option C)
• IgG4- parasitic infections (option D)",,B,
Q10,A veterinarian developed an ulcer with central black eschar over the forearm as shown in the image. which of the following is the most probable causative organism?,"a)pseudomonas aeruginosa
b)yersinia pestis
c)Bacillus anthracis
d)Francisella tularensis","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of cutaneous anthrax which is caused by Bacillus anthracis.
Human anthrax presents in one of three ways:
• Cutaneous Anthrax(hide porter’s disease)- Black eschar at the base, with a very prominent inflammatory ring around the eschar, is referred to as a malignant pustule.
• pulmonary Anthrax(wool sorter’s disease)- Hemorrhagic pneumonia.

• Intestinal Anthrax- Hemorrhagic diarrhoea. It occurs mainly in primitive communities that eat the carcasses of animals dying of anthrax.
Robert koch validated the germ theory of disease after discovering the anthrax bacillus as the
cause of anthrax. He also discovered the causative agents of tuberculosis and cholera. Hence, he is known as the Father of Bacteriology.
koch's postulates, which link specific microorganisms to specific diseases, state that the
microorganism must be:
• Found in abundance in diseased organisms, but not in healthy organisms.
• Isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture
• Able to cause disease when inoculated into a healthy organism
• Re-isolated from the diseased experimental host and identical to the original specific causative agent",1458-886.PNG,C,
Q11,which of the following is not used as an immediate test in the screening of urinary tract infections (UTI)?,"a)Pour plate culture
b)Griess Nitrite test
c)Leukocyte esterase test
d)wet mount examination","pour plate culture (quantitative test) is not used as an immediate test for screening of
UTI. However it is considered the best diagnostic test for confirmation of UTI due it’s high sensitivity and specificity.
The screening tests for UTI are as follows:
• wet mount examination: It is done to demonstrate pus cells in urine.
• Leukocyte esterase test: It is a rapid and cheaper method, and detects leukocyte esterases secreted by pus cells present in urine.
• Nitrate reduction test (Griess test): Nitrate reducing bacteria like E. coli give a positive result.
• catalase test: E. coli and other bacteria that produce the enzyme catalase give a positive result.
Quantitative culture:
• standardized loop technique
• pour plate method",,A,
Q12,In which of the following is the disc diffusion method for antibiotic susceptibility testing applied?,"a)Agar dilution method
b)kirby-Bauer method
c)Broth dilution method
d)PCR based assay","The disc diffusion method for antibiotic susceptibility testing is applied in the kirby-Bauer method.
In kirby-Bauer’s disc diffusion method, a suitable standard dilution of a broth culture of the test bacterium is inoculated on the surface of a solid medium (cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton agar) as a lawn culture. After drying, various antibiotic discs are placed on its surface. zones of
inhibition around the disc are recorded and interpreted according to the zone diameters available in the tables of the clinical and Laboratory standards Institute (cLsI) guidelines. The results
obtained are qualitative (resistant, sensitive, or partially sensitive).

The image below shows kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method.


Laboratory testing for antibiotic sensitivity can be done by:
• Diffusion methods: The drug diffuses through a solid medium so that a gradient is established. The concentration is highest near the site of drug application and decreases with distance. The
test bacterium is cultured on the medium and its sensitivity to the antibiotic is determined by the zone of growth inhibition. Examples include kirby–Bauer method and Stokes method.
• Dilution methods: Serial dilutions of the drug are prepared and inoculated with bacteria.
Examples include tube dilution method and agar dilution method
• Diffusion and dilution method: E–test (Epsilometer)",,B,1471-895.PNG
