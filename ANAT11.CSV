NUMBER,QUESTION,OPTIONS,SOLUTION,IMAGE Q,ANSWER KEY,IMAGE A
Q1,The structure marked A in the image below gives rise to which of the following structures?,"a) Gastrosplenic ligament
b) Lienorenal ligament
c) Falciform ligament
d) Gastrophrenic ligament","The structure marked A is ventral mesentery. The falciform ligament is a derivative of the ventral mesentery.
Mesenteries are double layers of the peritoneum that enclose an organ and connect it to the body wall.
• ventral mesentery: only the foregut has a ventral mesentery. It is derived from the septum transversum. when the liver grows into the mesenchyme of the septum transversum, it divides the ventral mesentery into 2 parts:
• Lesser omentum
• Ligaments of the liver- all ligaments of the liver (falciform ligament, right and left triangular ligaments, and coronary ligaments), except ligamentum teres
• Dorsal mesentery: The foregut, midgut, and hindgut have a dorsal mesentery. This connects the organs to the posterior abdominal wall.
• Gastrosplenic ligament (stomach to the spleen), lienorenal ligament (spleen to the left kidney), and gastrophrenic ligament (stomach to diaphragm) are derived from the dorsal mesentery.",301-313.PNG,C,301-313.PNG
Q2,A patient underwent surgery for the varicose vein. He now complains of sensory loss over the medial aspect of the leg and foot. which of the following nerves is most likely to be injured?,"a) sural nerve
b) superficial peroneal nerve
c) Deep peroneal nerve
d) saphenous nerve","The given clinical scenario in a patient with sensory loss over the medial aspect of the leg and foot is suggestive of injury to the saphenous nerve. Injury to the saphenous nerve is common following varicose vein surgery.
The saphenous nerve is the longest and largest cutaneous branch of the femoral nerve and is the longest nerve in the body. It arises from the posterior division of the femoral nerve. The saphenous nerve then descends along the medial border of the tibia along with the great saphenous vein (anterior to the vein) and supplies the skin on the medial side of the knee, leg, and foot up to the first metatarsophalangeal joint.
During stripping of veins in varicose surgery, injury to the saphenous nerve is common as it closely travels with the great saphenous vein.",,D,304-317.PNG
Q3,Identify the cartilage given below:,"a) Non articular hyaline cartilage
b) Articular hyaline cartilage
c) yellow cartilage
d) white fibrocartilage","The given image shows prominent collagen fibers arranged in bundles with intervening rows of chondrocytes. This is suggestive of white fibrocartilage.
Microscopy of fibrocartilage shows the following:
• chondrocytes- round in shape (in tendons they are flattened and elongated)
• Ground tissue with collagen fibers- type I collagen fibers
• Absence of perichondrium
Fibrocartilage is found in:
• Articular discs (temporomandibular joint and sternoclavicular joint)
• Intervertebral discs
• Menisci
• Glenoid and acetabular labrum
• pubic symphysis
• Manubriosternal joint
• The lining of the bony grooves for tendons",299-310.PNG,D,305-318.PNG
Q4,"A patient presents with a unilateral throbbing headache, photophobia, and excessive lacrimation. He also complains of hemifacial pain on clenching of teeth. on examination, pupillary reaction, light reflex, and accommodation reflex are normal. which of the following marked nerves is involved in the above scenario?","a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4","The above patient presents with features suggesting an involvement of the trigeminal nerve. The structure marked 3 is the trigeminal nerve.
other marked structures:
• 1- optic nerve. The normal visual field and light reflex rules out the involvement of the optic nerve.
• 2- oculomotor nerve. Normal accommodation and pupillary reflex rule out the involvement of the oculomotor nerve.
• 4- Facial nerve. Absence of motor involvement of the face rule out the involvement of the facial nerve.
The trigeminal nerve leaves the anterior aspect of the pons as a small motor root and a large sensory root. The large sensory root expands to form the crescent-shaped trigeminal ganglion, which lies within a pouch of dura mater called the trigeminal or Meckel's cave. The ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular nerves arise from the anterior border of the ganglion.",300-312.PNG,C,306-319.PNG
Q5,Identify the given structure:,"a) Lymph node
b) Glomerulus
c) spleen
d) pancreatic islet cells","The above image shows pancreatic islet cells. Islet of Langerhans makes up the endocrine part of the pancreas.
Islets are characterized by secretory cells supported by reticulin fibers, and containing numerous fenestrated capillaries. There is a delicate capsule around each islet. They are paler than the surrounding exocrine cells, as they have less rough endoplasmic reticulum.
The islets of Langerhans contain four major and two minor cell types:
• Four main types are β , α , δ , and PP (pancreatic polypeptide) cells:
• α or A cells- located peripherally and secrete glucagon
• β or B cells- located centrally and produce insulin
• δ or D cells- scattered between beta cells and secrete somatostatin
• PP cells- secrete a pancreatic polypeptide, which exerts several gastrointestinal effects.",300-311.PNG,D,308-321.PNG
