Q1,which of the following is contraindicated in PPH in a primigravida with chronic hypertension?,"a)Methyl ergometrine
b)Misoprostol
c)oxytocin
d)Prostaglandin F2 alpha","Methylergometrine is contraindicated in the management of postpartum hemorrhage in a female with chronic hypertension.
Methylergometrine is an ergot derivative, which acts directly on the myometrium. It excites
uterine contractions which come so frequently one after the other with increasing intensity that the uterus passes into a state of spasm without any relaxation in between. Hence, it should be    used only be used either in the late second stage of labor(after the delivery of the anterior
shoulder) or following the delivery of the baby.
Indications :
• prophylactic - Active management of the third stage of labor as prophylaxis to excess bleeding following delivery
• Therapeutic - To stop the atonic uterine bleeding, following delivery, abortion or expulsion of hydatidiform mole. It is used at a dose of o.2mg im/iv, repeated every 2-4 hours.
side effects :
• Nausea and vomiting.
• Because of its vasoconstrictive action, it may precipitate a rise in blood pressure, myocardial infarction, stroke and bronchospasm.
• Repeated use may lead to gangrene of the toes due to its vasoconstrictive effect.
• Repeated use in puerperium may interfere with lactation by lowering prolactin levels.
contraindications :
• Multiple pregnancy - If given accidentally with the delivery of the first baby, the second baby is compromised by the tetanic contractions of the uterus.
• Heart disease - Results in sudden squeezing of blood from the uterine circulation into the systemic circulation causing overloading of the right heart and failure.
• Hypertensive disorders, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia
• Rh-negative mother - More risk of fetomaternal microtransfusion.
• vascular disease
other options :
option B - Misoprostol is a methyl ester of pGE1, used in the induction of labor and in the
management of postpartum hemorrhage. side effects include fever, tachysystole
(hyperstimulation), fetal heart rate changes and meconium passage. It should not be used for cases with previous cesarean birth because the risk of uterine rupture is high.
option c - oxytocin is used in the active management of the third stage of labor, augmentation of  labor and control of postpartum hemorrhage. contraindications for its use are hypovolemic states, obstructed labor and cardiac disease.
option D - prostaglandin F2 alpha derivative (carboprost) is used in the management of
postpartum hemorrhage. contraindications for its use are asthma, active cardiac, renal, or hepatic



disease.",,A,
Q2,"A 16-year-old female came with complaints of primary amenorrhoea. she had normal
secondary sexual characteristics and breast development corresponded to Tanner stage IV. Her FsH - 5.3 and LH - 12.1. Her karyotype is 46xx. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)kallmann syndrome
b)Androgen insensitivity syndrome
c)Gonadal dysgenesis
d)Mullerian agenesis","The given clinical scenario is that of a female with primary amenorrhea, preservation of secondary characteristics, and normal levels of FSH and LH, with a karyotype of 46xx. These are features of Mullerian agenesis.
congenital absence of both the uterus and vagina is termed Mullerian agenesis or
Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome. Females have a shallow vaginal pouch (1 to 2 inches deep). The uterus, cervix, and upper part of the vagina are absent. Typically, normal ovaries
persist, as they originate from the genital ridge. Individual presents with primary amenorrhea,   have a normal female appearance, secondary sexual characteristics, and 46 xx karyotype. Most patients with Mullerian agenesis have only small rudimentary Mullerian bulbs without
endometrial activity.
with Mullerian agenesis, traditional conception is not possible, but pregnancy may be achieved using oocyte retrieval, fertilization, and gestational surrogacy.
Individuals with Mullerian agenesis or hypoplasia have associated congenital renal or skeletal    anomalies. common renal anomalies include ectopic, horseshoe or pelvic kidney and collecting system anomalies. Skeletal malformations include spina bifida, sacralization, sacral bone
lumbarization, and cervical vertebral anomalies.
other options:
option A - Kallmann syndrome presents with primary amenorrhea due to hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism from deficiency of GnRH. The FSH and LH levels are lower than normal, leading to poor development of secondary sexual characteristics. It is associated with olfactory
dysfunction and anosmia.
option B - Androgen insensitivity syndrome occurs due to a defect in the androgen receptor in a genotypic male (xy). These individuals are phenotypic females with no male or female internal
genitalia. They have normal female external genitalia with an absent or shallow vagina,
well-developed breasts, and scanty body hair (axillary and pubic) and present with primary amenorrhea.
option c - Gonadal dysgenesis in the form of 45xo (Turner syndrome) or 46xy (Swyer
syndrome) presents with poor development of secondary sexual characteristics. Since the gonads are nonfunctional, there is a loss of negative feedback with increased levels of FSH and LH.",,D,6236-3851.PNG;6236-3852.PNG
Q3,which of the following combinations is not seen in the case of twin pregnancy?,"a)Monochorionic monoamniotic (MCMA)
b)Dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA)
c)Monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA)
d)Dichorionic monoamniotic (DCMA)","Dichorionic monoamniotic (DCMA) combination is not seen in twin pregnancies.
The table below describes the types of amnion and chorion seen in different types of twins, depending on the time of division.
In monochorionic diamniotic gestation, the twins are separated only by the two amniotic
membranes, with no intervening chorion. So, a thin 'T sign' is formed at the point at which the
amnions meet the placenta. It is best seen in the latter part of the first trimester or at the
beginning of the second trimester. In monochorionic monoamniotic gestation, there is an absence of a dividing membrane.



Time of division after fertiliz ation	Type of twin
o - 4 days (morula)	Dichorionic diamniotic (DCD A)
4 - 8 days (blastocyst)	Monochorionic diamniotic ( MCDA)
8 - 12 days (implanted blasto cyst)	Monochorionic monoamnioti c (MCMA)
>13 days (formed embryonic disc)	Conjoined twins


In dichorionic gestation, the twins are separated by amniotic membranes and an intervening chorion. So, a thicker twin peak sign or lambda (λ) sign is formed at the point at which the     amnions meet the placenta. It is best seen in the first trimester.",,D,6237-3854.PNG;6237-3853.PNG
Q4,"An 18-year-old girl was brought by her mother with complaints of primary amenorrhea and   acute retention of urine. she had cyclical abdominal pain and on examination, a supra pubic



mass and a tense bluish bulge were seen in her vagina. what is the most appropriate cause of her symptoms?","a)Imperforate hymen
b)Transverse vaginal septum
c)vertical vaginal septum
d)Mullerian agenesis","The features of primary amenorrhea, cyclical abdominal pain, acute retention of urine along with a tense bluish bulge make the diagnosis of imperforate hymen more likely.
Imperforate hymen is a type of Mullerian defect, of urogenital origin. Failure of canalization leads to the formation of mucocolpos; this may be recognized in early infancy. However, the anomaly
often continues unrecognized until puberty. It presents with amenorrhoea in the presence of    secondary sexual characters, cyclic abdominal discomfort, retention of urine and a suprapubic bulge caused by hematocolpos. Examination of the external genitalia reveals the presence of a telltale bluish bulging membrane in the region of the hymen.
A simple cruciate incision followed by an excision of the hymenal tags allows the drainage of the    retained menstrual blood. The operation should be performed under aseptic conditions and under an adequate antibiotic cover to avoid any ascending infection.
other options :
option B - Transverse vaginal septum is a much rarer condition that occurs due to faulty fusion or canalization of the urogenital sinus and the Müllerian ducts. The majority of the cases involve the  upper portion of the vagina. It can be differentiated from imperforate hymen by the presence of a  short vagina and the absence of a bulging membrane.
option c - vertical vaginal septum occurs when the distal parts of the Müllerian ducts fail to fuse. on examination, there is a longitudinal anteroposterior septum which may be partial or complete, extending right down to the vaginal outlet. It may be associated with a double uterus and double    cervix.
option D - Mullerian agenesis is characterized by congenital absence of the uterus and vagina (small rudimentary uterine bulbs are usually present). The female presents with primary
amenorrhea and preservation of female secondary sexual characteristics.",,A,
Q5,"In the quadruple marker test, a 33-year-old G2P1L1 at 18 weeks of gestation was found to be  at a high risk of neural tube defects and low risk of trisomy 21. what is the next investigation to be done?","a)Amniocentesis
b)chorionic villus sampling
c)Non invasive prenatal testing
d)Anomaly scan","For a female with a quadruple test showing a low risk of trisomy 21, the next investigation to be done is an anomaly scan, as part of routine antenatal care.
Prenatal genetic counseling involves screening and diagnostic methods. The various screening methods are as follows
The values of the parameters in trisomy 21 are as follows :
PAPP-A - low, MSAFP - low, unconjugated estriol - low,  NT - increased, Beta hcG - high, inhibin A - high.
If the screening tests report a high risk of aneuploidy, then the confirmatory diagnostic test is performed, depending on the trimester.
• chorionic villus sampling - Transcervical - 1o-13 weeks, transabdominal - 1o weeks to term
• Amniocentesis - After 15 weeks



• Cordocentesis - 18-2o weeks
since the screening test report in the question mentions a low risk of trisomy 21, the female
should be followed up with an anomaly scan, which is performed as a part of the antenatal care at 18-2o weeks. It gives a detailed survey of fetal anatomy, placental localization and the integrity of  the cervical canal.
other options :
option A - Amniocentesis is a confirmatory karyotyping test performed if the initial screening test reveals a high risk of aneuploidy.
option B - Chorionic villus sampling (Cvs) is also a confirmatory test, hence done if there is a high risk of aneuploidy. Moreover, Cvs is not performed at 18 weeks.
option C - Non-invasive prenatal testing utilizes cell-free fetal DNA in the maternal blood.
However, it is a screening test. since the female here has already undergone a screening test, there is no benefit is subjecting her to a second screening test.

Q6,"An 18-year-old came with complaints of pain in the abdomen and bleeding Pv for the last 2 days. Her last menstrual period was 6 weeks back. on examination, she has hypotension,    tachycardia and cervical motion tenderness. ultrasound of the abdomen shows free fluid in the pouch of Douglas and paracolic gutters. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Placenta previa
b)Abruptio placenta
c)Ruptured ectopic pregnancy
d)Missed abortion","The given clinical scenario with a triad of abdominal pain, amenorrhea and vaginal bleeding,  along with the ultrasound findings of free fluid, is suggestive of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.
An ectopic pregnancy is one in which the fertilized ovum is implanted and develops outside the    normal endometrial cavity, with the Fallopian tubes being the most common site. The outcomes  of such a pregnancy are varied with tubal rupture and massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage being one of them.
Clinical features :
• The incidence is maximum between the age of 2o and 3o years, the maximum fertility period. The onset is acute. The classic triad of symptoms is - abdominal pain (1oo%), preceded by
amenorrhea of 6-8 weeks(75%), and lastly, the appearance of vaginal bleeding (7o%).
• Abdominal pain is the most constant feature. Pain is located in the lower abdomen. shoulder tip pain (25%) (referred pain due to diaphragmatic irritation from hemoperitoneum) may be present.
• vomiting, fainting attack. syncopal attack (1o%) is due to reflex vasomotor disturbances following peritoneal irritation from the hemoperitoneum.
• Pallor and features of shock - feeble pulse with tachycardia, hypotension, cold clammy extremities.



• pelvic examination - Vaginal mucosa is blanched white; uterus seems normal in size or slightly bulky; extreme tenderness on fornix palpation(75%).
Investigations :
Estimation of ß-hcG - The findings suggestive of ectopic are a lower concentration of hcG
compared to normal intrauterine pregnancy, and doubling in plasma failing to occur in 2 days. Sonography: Transvaginal sonography (TVS) is more informative. The diagnostic features are    • Absence of intrauterine pregnancy with a positive pregnancy test.
• Fluid (echogenic) in the pouch of Douglas.
• Adnexal mass clearly separated from the ovary (Blob sign).
color Doppler sonography can identify the placental shape (ring-of-fire pattern) and enhanced blood flow pattern outside the uterine cavity.
Management of ruptured ectopic :
The principle in the management is resuscitation and laparotomy, and not resuscitation followed by laparotomy. Salpingectomy is the definitive surgery.
other options :
option A - placenta previa is a type of antepartum hemorrhage occurring after 28 weeks of
pregnancy. It presents as sudden onset painless, recurrent vaginal bleeding. USG findings reveal placenta occupying the lower segment of uterus.
option B - Abruptio placenta is another form of antepartum hemorrhage occurring due to
premature separation of the normally situated placenta. The majority of cases occur in the third trimester. The clinical features vary depending on whether the hemorrhage is concealed or
revealed and include abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding. Ultrasound reveals a collection of blood in the retroplacental, subchorionic or preplacental region.
option D - Missed abortion refers to when the fetus is dead and retained inside the uterus.
clinical features include the persistence of brownish vaginal discharge and subsidence of
pregnancy symptoms. Examination findings are uterus size smaller than the period of gestation and closed cervical os. USG reveals an empty sac or a fetus without cardiac activity.",,C,
Q7,"A 32 year old primigravida with chronic hypertension came to the hospital at 36 weeks of
gestation with headache and blurring vision. Her BP is 17o/11o mm Hg. urine analysis reveals urine albumin 3+. what is the next step to be done?","a)Injection labetalol and magnesium sulphate and expedite the delivery
b)Injection labetalol , antenatal steroids and immediate termination of pregnancy
c)Injection labetalol and magnesium sulphate and deliver at 37 weeks
d)Injection labetalol to control her blood pressure","The given scenario is suggestive of chronic hypertension with superimposed severe pre-eclampsia. The next step in the management is to give injection labetalol, and magnesium sulfate and
expedite the delivery, irrespective of the duration of gestation.
The criteria for diagnosis of superimposed pre-eclampsia are :
• New onset proteinuria
• Aggravation of hypertension
• Development of HELLp syndrome
• Development of headache, scotoma, and epigastric pain.



pre-eclampsia is further divided into :
• Nonsevere pre-eclampsia: Blood pressure &gt;14o/9o mmHg but &lt;16o/11o mmHg without significant proteinuria
• Severe pre-eclampsia: persistent increase of systolic blood pressure above 16o mmHg or
diastolic above 11o mmHg, proteinuria, oliguria (&lt;4oo mL in 24 hours), platelet count &lt;1
lakh/cu.mm, serum creatinine level of &gt;1.1 mg/dL, persistent severe epigastric pain, marked
elevation of liver enzyme levels, convulsions or visual disturbances, intrauterine growth restriction of the fetus, and pulmonary edema.
In a patient with severe pre-eclampsia, ie, systolic Bp ≥ 16o mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 11o mm Hg,   immediate delivery after single-dose steroids is indicated regardless of the period of gestation.   concurrently, injection labetalol is given to reduce the blood pressure and injection magnesium sulfate is given for seizure prophylaxis.
patients with pre-eclampsia may be expectantly managed up to 34 weeks of gestation. After 34
weeks pregnancy, may be prolonged up to 37 weeks if there is adequate Bp control, and delivery is recommended at 37 weeks of gestation. However, in the following events, pregnancy is terminated regardless of the period of gestation:
• uncontrolled severe hypertension
• Eclampsia
• pulmonary edema
• HELLp Syndrome
• Renal dysfunction
• coagulopathy (disseminated intravascular coagulation)
• Abruption
• Fetal compromise",,A,6241-3855.PNG
Q8,"A female at 4o weeks of gestation presents with labor pains and is in the second stage of labor for the last 2 hours. on examination of the abdomen, there are 4 uterine contractions per 1o   minutes each lasting more than a minute. on Pv examination, the fetal station is at +3 and
the suture is in AP diameter and caput +. The fetal heart rate is 7o beats/ minute in the last 2o minutes. which is the appropriate method of delivery?","a)outlet forceps
b)ventouse delivery
c)Mid cavity forceps
d)Low cavity forceps","In the given scenario, outlet forceps would be the best choice of instrumental delivery as the fetus is at +3 station, with suture in AP diameter and has caput.
The criteria for the application of different types of forceps are as follows :
outlet forceps :
• scalp is visible at the introitus without separating the labia
• Fetal skull has reached the level of the pelvic floor
• sagittal suture is in direct anteroposterior diameter or in the right or left occiput anterior or posterior position, but rotation is &lt;=45 degrees
• Fetal head is at or on the perineum
Low forceps :
• Leading point of the fetal skull (station) is at +2 cm or more but has not yet reached the pelvic floor, and
(a) Rotation is &lt;=45°, or (b) Rotation is &gt;45° Mid forceps :
• Fetal head is engaged. Head is 1/5 palpable per abdomen but the station is above +2 cm but not above the ischial spines (station o).
High forceps :
• Head is not engaged. This type of forceps is not used in current obstetrics.
Note : ventouse is not the best choice for a fetus with caput, as there is a risk of scalp avulsion. Also, the vacuum cannot be adequately generated owing to the presence of soft tissue swelling.",,A,6242-3856.PNG
Q9,which of the following hormones is not responsible for the in-utero growth of the baby?,"a)Insulin
b)Growth hormone
c)Insulin like growth factor
d)Thyroxine","Growth hormone does not play a role in the in-utero growth of a baby. It is, however, essential for postnatal growth.
Normal fetal growth is characterized by cellular hyperplasia followed by hyperplasia and
hypertrophy and lastly by hypertrophy alone. The fetal growth increases linearly until the 37th
week. It is controlled by genetic factors in the first half and by environmental factors in the second half of pregnancy. Imprinted genes (maternal or paternally acquired alleles) primarily control fetal growth.
The important physiological factors are race (European babies are heavier than Indians); sex
(male baby weighs &gt;female); parental height and weight (tall and heavier mothers have heavier babies); birth order (weight rises from first to second pregnancy) and socioeconomic factors
(heavier babies in social class I and II).
Fetal growth is predominantly controlled by insulin-like growth factor -1 (IGF-1), insulin and other growth factors. Maternal and fetal thyroid hormones also play a role in the normal development     of virtually all fetal tissues, especially the brain.",,B,
Q10,A G2P1L1 delivered a baby via full-term vaginal delivery. The baby is 3 kgs and is active and   plays well. Her blood group was found to be o negative and her husband's blood group was   found to be B positive. she was given anti-D at 28 weeks of gestation. which of the following is the appropriate situation to administer postpartum anti D prophylaxis?,"a)Baby is o positive and DCT is negative
b)Baby is o negative and DCT is negative
c)Baby is o negative and DCT positive
d)Baby is o positive and DCT positive","post-partum anti-D prophylaxis is given if the baby is o positive and DCT (direct Coombs' test) is negative.
To prevent active immunization of Rh-negative yet unimmunized, Rh anti-D immunoglobulin    (IgG) is administered intramuscularly to the mother following childbirth. The mode of action is antibody-mediated immune suppression.
Anti-D immunoglobulin should be administered within 72 hours or preferably earlier following delivery or abortion. It should be given provided the baby born is Rh-positive and the direct
Coombs’ test is negative. This reduces the alloimmunization rate by 9o%. use of anti-D
immunoglobulin at 28 weeks gestation additionally reduces third-trimester alloimmunization to o.1%.
Dose: Anti-D-gammaglobulin is administered intramuscularly to the mother (3oo µg) following delivery. All Rh-negative unsensitized women should receive 5o µg of Rh-immunoglobulin IM
within 72 hours of induced or spontaneous abortion, ectopic or molar pregnancy or chorionic
villus sampling in the first trimester. women with pregnancy beyond 12 weeks should have a full dose of 3oo µg. standard 3oo µg of anti-D immunoglobulin IM dose will protect a mother from   fetal hemorrhage of up to 3o mL of fetal whole blood or 15 mL of fetal RBCs.
other options:
Anti-D prophylaxis is futile if -
• the baby has Rh negative blood group - there is no risk of alloimmunization when the Rh antigen is absent
• if the DCT of the baby's blood is positive - it means that alloimmunization has already occurred.
such babies are managed with other treatment options like exchange transfusion.",,A,
Q11,what is the correct dose of administration of antenatal steroids for lung maturity?,"a)Betamethasone 12 mg 12 hours apart 4 doses
b)Dexamethasone 6 mg 12 hours apart 4 doses
c)Betamethasone 6mg 12hrly 4 doses
d)Dexamethasone 12mg 24hrly 2 doses","The correct dose of administration of antenatal steroids for lung maturity is dexamethasone 6 mg
12 hours apart 4 doses.
Maternal administration of corticosteroids is advocated where the pregnancy is less than 34
weeks. This helps in fetal lung maturation. This is beneficial when the delivery is delayed beyond
48 hours of the first dose. The benefit persists as long as 18 days. Either betamethasone 12 mg IM
24 hours apart for two doses or dexamethasone 6 mg IM every 12 hours for 4 doses is given.
Betamethasone is the steroid of choice (RCOG–2004).
Antenatal steroids also reduce the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage and patent ductus arteriosus.
Risks of antenatal corticosteroid use:
• premature rupture of the membranes especially with evidence of infection, as the infection may flare-up
• Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus where patients need insulin dose readjustment
• Transient reduction of fetal breathing and body movements.",,B,
Q12,which of the following is not a criterion to diagnose IUGR?,"a)Estimated fetal weight &lt; 3rd percentile
b)Abdominal circumference less than 3rd percentile
c)Absent diastolic flow in umbilical artery
d)Uterine artery pI &lt; 95th percentile","uterine artery pulsatility index (pI) &lt; 95th percentile is not a criterion used to diagnose intrauterine growth restriction (IuGR).
Fetal growth restriction (FGR)/IuGR is said to be present in those babies whose birth weight is below the 10th centile of the average for the gestational age.
The causes of fetal growth restriction are divided into :
• Maternal - constitutional, nutritional, anemia, hypertension, chronic renal disease, alcohol, smoking
• Fetal - structural anomaly, chromosomal anomaly, infections, multiple pregnancy
• placental -placenta previa, abruption, circumvallate placenta
• unknown
Diagnosis :
Clinical -
• symphysis fundal height (sFH) measurement in centimeters closely correlates with gestational age after 24 weeks. A lag of 3 cm or more suggests growth restriction.
• Maternal weight gain remains stationary or, at times, falling
• Measurement of the abdominal girth showing stationary or falling values
ultrasound -
various criteria and thresholds have been used to define FGR. These have included estimated fetal weights (EFW) below the 3rd, 5th, or 10th percentiles; similar abdominal circumference (AC)



percentiles; a specified decline in the EFW percentile or AC percentile over serial assessments; and various abnormal Doppler findings.
Currently, the ACOG (2o21) and the society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (2o2o) recommend
defining FGR as either an EFW &lt;1oth percentile for gestational age or an AC &lt;1oth percentile for gestational age.
AC is the single most sensitive parameter to detect FGR.
Doppler velocimetry - The umbilical artery Doppler study should be the primary surveillance tool in FGR (RCOG).
• In normal pregnancy, the systolic/diastolic (s/D) ratio, pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI) decrease as the gestational age advances. Values greater than 2sD indicate reduced diastolic   velocities and increased placental vascular resistance. These are associated with FGR and
intra-uterine fetal hypoxia.
• Reduced or absent or reversed end-diastolic velocity (AREDV) in the umbilical artery indicates fetal jeopardy and poor perinatal outcome.
• Umbilical venous pulsations indicate inefficient cardiac output with a rise in central venous pressure → impending cardiac failure.
• Middle cerebral artery (MCA): Increased diastolic velocity (brain-sparing effect) is observed in
FGR. This is due to cerebral vasodilatation in response to hypoxemia. Abnormal MCA PI, suggests fetal compromise.
• Doppler cerebroplacental ratio (CPR): It is calculated by dividing MCA PI by UA PI. In FGR, placental resistance (UA PI) increases and fetal brain vascular resistance (MCA PI) decreases   resulting in a decrease in CPR index. CPR is more sensitive compared to UA or MCA Doppler alone.
Management is as outlined below :",,D,6245-3857.PNG
Q13,Early onset pre-eclampsia is defined before:,"a)28 weeks
b)3o weeks
c)32 weeks
d)34 weeks","Early onset pre-eclampsia is defined before 34 weeks.
pre-eclampsia is characterized by hypertension and end-organ dysfunction that typically develops after 2o weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive individual.
Features of pre-eclampsia:
• Hypertension:
Blood pressure ≥14o/9o mmHg on 2 occasions at least 4 hours apart, or ≥16o/11o mmHg in a single measurement.
• proteinuria:
≥3oo mg of protein in a 24-hour urine collection.
protein/creatinine ratio ≥o.3.
Dipstick reading of ≥1+ (though less specific).
• End-organ Dysfunction (may occur even without proteinuria):
Renal: Elevated serum creatinine &gt;1.1 mg/dL or doubling of baseline.
Hepatic: Elevated liver transaminases (AsT/ALT).
Hematologic: Thrombocytopenia (&lt;1oo,ooo/µL).
Neurologic: severe headache, visual disturbances (e.g., scotoma, blurred vision).
pulmonary: pulmonary edema.
Early-onset pre-eclampsia:
• occurs before 34 weeks of gestation.
• Associated with more severe complications, including fetal growth restriction and placental insufficiency.
• Requires careful monitoring and often early delivery if maternal or fetal conditions worsen. Late-onset pre-eclampsia:
• occurs at or after 34 weeks of gestation.
• Typically milder, with fewer complications.
Management
• Mild pre-eclampsia: close monitoring, antihypertensives (e.g., labetalol, nifedipine), and maternal-fetal surveillance.
• severe pre-eclampsia: Hospitalization, magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis, and delivery planning (often the definitive treatment).
• Timing of Delivery:
Recommended at ≥37 weeks for mild pre-eclampsia.

c)Hr HpV testing every 5 years starting at 3o years
d)pap smear every 5 years starting at 21 years","In the given scenario, cervical cancer is screened by performing a pap smear every 3 years, starting at 21 years.
Pap smear is a screening test. In case of positive test further investigations should be done.

• women aged 21-29 years: Every 3 years(earlier it was done annually)
• women aged 3o-65 years: Pap test + HPV testing every 5 years.
• women should stop having cervical cancer screening after the age of 65 years. If suspicious PAP, screening till 75 years.
• HIV+ women: annual checkup until three consecutive negative tests followed by testing every 3 years for life.
• HPV DNA testing in combination with PAP improves the sensitivity of screening. Ayres spatula and endocervical brush are the instruments used for the pap test.

Q15,"26-year P1L1 presents with abdominal pain. She has a past history of rheumatic heart disease for which she has undergone mitral valve replacement surgery and is on the oral tablet
warfarin 3mg oD. on examination, an abdominal mass corresponding to 14 weeks was felt. on USG, an 8*6 cm unilocular cyst with a reticular pattern was observed in the left ovary.    what is the next line of management?","a)Measure CA-125
b)Repeat USG after 6-12 weeks
c)Surgical intervention
d)MRI pelvis","The USG findings of a unilocular cyst with reticular pattern indicate a functional hemorrhagic cyst. Hence, the next line of management is to repeat USG after 6-12 weeks.
Although the cyst size is &gt;7 cm, invasive treatments are not suitable immediately because of her current use of warfarin which needs time to be tapered. Also, as most functional cysts resolve
spontaneously over time, repeat USG might show a decrease in cyst size.
Management of ovarian cysts in reproductive age and perimenopausal women is mentioned in the table below:
other options:
option A: Measure CA-125: In this case, it might not be the best first step because CA-125 is not    specific and its level can be influenced by multiple factors. Additionally, the cyst described here is more likely to be benign (reticular pattern suggesting blood), such as a functional ovarian cyst or   follicular cyst.
option C: Surgical Intervention: Surgical intervention may be required if there are signs of
torsion, rupture, or malignancy. However, with a simple, unilocular cyst without these features,
surgery is usually not warranted immediately, especially as the patient is on warfarin and needs to be tapered. This approach would be more appropriate if the cyst showed signs of complications or did not resolve after monitoring.
option D: MRI Pelvis: An MRI can offer more detailed imaging if there is concern about the nature of the cyst, but it is typically reserved for complicated cysts (e.g., solid components,   suspicious features). It's not the first-line investigation in this case.

Q16,when is delayed cord clamping done?,"a)Term and preterm babies irrespective of birth weights
b)vigorous term and preterm babies requiring resuscitation
c)vigorous term babies requiring resuscitation
d)All term babies born at 37 weeks","Delayed cord clamping (DCC) is done in term and preterm babies irrespective of birth weight.  DCC involves waiting at least 3o–6o seconds or more after birth before clamping the umbilical cord. It is recommended for both term and preterm babies as part of standard delivery care.
Indications of DCC:
• Term infants: DCC improves iron stores and reduces the risk of anemia in infancy.
• preterm infants: DCC increases blood volume and reduces the risks of:
• Intraventricular hemorrhage
• Necrotizing enterocolitis
• provides stabilization benefits by enhancing transitional circulation
Babies irrespective of birth weights: The benefits of DCC apply regardless of the baby's weight. Contraindications of DCC:
• Babies requiring immediate resuscitation: In emergencies, immediate neonatal stabilization takes priority, and DCC may not be feasible.
• Maternal or placental complications: Conditions like placental abruption or postpartum hemorrhage may necessitate immediate cord clamping for maternal safety.
other options:
option B and C: Vigorous term and preterm babies requiring resuscitation: Resuscitation needs immediate intervention, which may preclude delayed cord clamping.
option D: All term babies born at 37 weeks: while DCC is recommended for term infants, the
guideline includes preterm babies too, so this option is incomplete. It also fails to exclude babies requiring resuscitation.",,A,
Q17,"A couple presents with infertility even after 2 years of unprotected intercourse. The seminal  analysis reveals a volume of 2 mL, concentration of 4o million/ml, progressive motility of      55%, and morphology of 45%. The wife's hormone levels were normal with bilateral spillage of dye from both fallopian tubes on HSG. what percentage of couples can be attributed to     unexplained infertility?","a)5%
b)3o%
c)15%
d)25%","25% of couples can be attributed to unexplained infertility.
unexplained infertility refers to cases where no clear cause of infertility can be identified after a thorough evaluation of both partners. In the scenario provided, the male partner has normal
seminal parameters, and the female partner has normal hormonal levels and patent fallopian



tubes, making this a case of unexplained infertility.
some causes of unexplained infertility include:
• ovulatory Dysfunction
• Impaired sperm function despite normal semen analysis
• Tubal or uterine Factors
• Endometriosis
• Antisperm antibodies or autoimmune issues.
• Lifestyle and Environmental Factors: stress, smoking, diet, or environmental toxins.
unexplained infertility is diagnosed when standard evaluations yield normal results:
• semen analysis showing normal volume, concentration, motility, and morphology.
• Normal hormonal tests, basal body temperature, or ovulation predictor kits.
• Hysterosalpingography (HsG) or saline sonography shows no blockages.
• Transvaginal ultrasound or hysteroscopy ruling out structural abnormalities.
If no cause is identified after these tests, the couple is categorized as having unexplained infertility.
Management includes:
1. Expectant Management
• suitable for younger couples (&lt;35 years) with a short duration of infertility.
• Lifestyle modifications (e.g., weight management, smoking cessation, stress reduction).
2. Medical :
• ovulation Induction: Clomiphene citrate or Letrozole.
• Gonadotropins: Injectable hormones (FsH, LH) for controlled ovarian stimulation.
3. Intrauterine Insemination (IuI)
4. Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)
• In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)
• Intracytoplasmic sperm Injection (ICsI)",,D,
Q18,which of the following is not a physiological change seen in pregnancy?,"a)peripheral resistance to insulin leading to hyperinsuliemia
b)Fasting hypoglycemia and postprandial hyperglycemia
c)Increased plasma volume and RBC mass","Increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure after 6 weeks is not a physiological change seen in pregnancy.
During early pregnancy, systemic vascular resistance decreases, leading to a drop in blood  pressure (both systolic and diastolic), which typically reaches its lowest point in the second trimester. Blood pressure gradually returns to pre-pregnancy levels in the third trimester.



An increase in blood pressure during early pregnancy is not physiological and could indicate an   underlying pathology (e.g., chronic hypertension or gestational hypertension later in pregnancy). Cardiovascular parameters that increase in pregnancy are:
• Cardiac output
• Stroke volume
• Heart rate
Cardiovascular parameters that decrease in pregnancy are:
• Peripheral vascular resistance (due to smooth muscle relaxation by progesterone)
• Both diastolic BP and systolic BP (decrease in DBP &gt; SBP)
• Mean arterial BP
• Artery venous o2 gradient
other options:
option B: Peripheral resistance to insulin leading to hyperinsuliemia: During pregnancy, placental hormones like human placental lactogen (hPL), cortisol, and progesterone induce insulin
resistance to ensure adequate glucose availability for the fetus. This leads to compensatory hyperinsulinemia.
option C: Fasting hypoglycemia and postprandial hyperglycemia: Fasting hypoglycemia occurs    due to increased maternal glucose utilization by the fetus. Postprandial hyperglycemia is a result of insulin resistance and slower glucose uptake.
option D: Increased plasma volume and RBC mass: Plasma volume increases by about 4o-5o%, and red blood cell (RBC) mass increases by 2o-3o%, leading to hemodilution and the
physiological anemia of pregnancy.",,A,
Q19,Instrument assisted delivery is not indicated in which of the following?,"a)Fetal distress
b)Maternal exhaustion
c)prolonged second stage of labour
d)Cephalo pelvic disproportion","Instrument-assisted delivery is not indicated in cephalo pelvic disproportion. Ruling out CPD is a prerequisite before attempting instrument-assisted delivery.
Cephalo-pelvic disproportion (CPD) is a condition in which the baby’s head is too large, or the
pelvis is too small, for the baby to pass through the birth canal. In such cases, instrument-assisted delivery is not indicated because vaginal birth is not feasible. The appropriate management for
CPD is usually a cesarean section to avoid complications for both mother and baby.
Conditions where instrument-assisted delivery may be indicated:
• Fetal distress: If the baby is showing signs of distress (such as decelerations in the heart rate), an instrument-assisted delivery may be needed to expedite delivery and reduce the risk of further
harm. (option A)
• Maternal exhaustion: In cases of maternal fatigue, particularly after a prolonged second stage of labor, instruments may be used to assist in delivery if the mother is unable to continue pushing     effectively. (option B)



• prolonged second stage of labor: If the second stage of labor (when the cervix is fully dilated and the baby is descending) is prolonged, instruments can be used to assist in the delivery of the baby, especially if there are signs of fetal distress or maternal exhaustion. (option c)
prerequisites for instrumental vaginal delivery:
• Ruptured membranes vertex presentation
• cephalopelvic disproportion not suspected
• No fetal coagulopathy or bone demineralization disorder
• completely dilated cervix
• precisely assessed fetal head position
• Engaged head
• Experienced operator",,D,
Q20,In which stage of meiosis is the primary oocyte arrested?,"a)Diplotene
b)Leptotene
c)zygotene
d)pachytene","The primary oocyte is arrested in prophase I of meiosis during a specific substage called diplotene.
primary oocytes initiate meiosis I, but are arrested in prophase I before birth.
The arrest persists until puberty, when hormonal signals trigger the resumption of meiosis in a selected number of oocytes during each menstrual cycle.


Meiosis I (Reduction Division): Homologous chromosomes separate.
• prophase I: chromosomes pair, cross over.
• Metaphase I: Homologous pairs align at the equator.
• Anaphase I: Homologous chromosomes separate.



• Telophase I: Two haploid cells form.
Meiosis II (Equational Division): sister chromatids separate.
• prophase II: chromosomes condense.
• Metaphase II: chromosomes align at the equator.
• Anaphase II: sister chromatids separate.
• Telophase II: Four genetically unique haploid cells form.
prophase I consists of several substages (leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, diplotene, and diakinesis). In primary oocytes:
• Leptotene: chromosomes condense and become visible. (option B)
• zygotene: Homologous chromosomes pair up through synapsis. (option c)
• pachytene: crossing over occurs between non-sister chromatids. (option D)
• Diplotene stage: The homologous chromosomes are connected at chiasmata (sites of crossing
over), and the oocyte enters a prolonged resting phase. At ovulation, the primary oocyte completes meiosis I and becomes a secondary oocyte, which then gets arrested in metaphase II of meiosis
until fertilization.
• Diakinesis: chromosomes fully condense; nuclear envelope breaks down.",,A,6252-3860.PNG
Q21,Restitution is best described as:,"a)passive movement of head due to untwisting of neck
b)Movement of the head by 1/8th of the circle due to torsion
c)Stretching of the vulval outlet by the head
d)External rotation after delivery of shoulder","Restitution describes a passive adjustment of the head to untwist the neck after internal rotation.
The most common position of the fetus is the left occipito-lateral position where the vertex occupies the left anterior quadrant of the mother's pelvis.
During internal rotation, there will be anterior rotation of the occiput by 2/8th of a circle, placing the occiput behind the symphysis pubis. There is always an accompanying movement of descent   with internal rotation. (option B)
Torsion of the neck occurs during internal rotation of the head. The neck cannot withstand such a high degree of torsion, so the shoulders will rotate in the same direction to the extent of 1/8th of a circle, placing the shoulders in the oblique diameter with one-eighth of the torsion still left
behind. Torsion refers to the twisting forces applied to the fetal head and neck during internal rotation to align the head with the birth canal.
In restitution, these twisting forces are released, allowing the head to return to its anatomical alignment with the shoulders.





other options:
option B: Movement of the head by 1/8th of the circle due to torsion: While the head typically
does rotate by about 1/8th of a circle (45°) during restitution, this is a passive as the tension in the neck resolves. The phrase ""due to torsion"" is misleading because torsion refers to twisting forces    exerted during internal rotation, not restitution. Restitution is about the release of torsion, not its application.
option C: Stretching of the vulval outlet by the head: This describes a process that occurs during    the crowning stage of labor, not during restitution. At crowning, the fetal head stretches the vulval outlet as it emerges. Restitution occurs after the head is delivered and involves the passive
rotation of the head to align with the shoulders.
option D: External rotation after delivery of shoulder: once the shoulders are delivered, the head undergoes a second adjustment to align with the shoulders as they rotate to fit through the
maternal pelvis. This is an active movement that happens post-delivery of the shoulders, while restitution occurs before shoulder delivery.",,A,6254-3861.PNG
Q22,which of the following is NOT part of AMTSL?,"a)uterine massage
b)Delivery of placenta by controlled cord traction
c)Bimanual compression
d)Administration of oxytocin after shoulder delivery","Bimanual compression is not part of AMTSL.
AMTSL is recommended by the WHo to prevent postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). uterotonics are the most important components in AMTSL to do so.
Note: uterine massage or fundal massage is not recommended as an intervention to prevent PPH in women who have already received prophylactic uterotonics such as oxytocin (core component   of AMTSL). Hence, it is now an optional component of AMTSL that is done in patients with
uterine atony as a part of the management of PPH.  (option A)

Q23,A 35-year-old P2L2 woman presents with malodorous vaginal discharge and a normal cervix. The whiff test is positive. what is this condition?,"a)candida
b)chalmydia
c)Bacterial vaginosis
d)Pelvic inflammatory disease","The patient with malodorous vaginal discharge and a positive whiff test, strongly suggests bacterial vaginosis.
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is caused by an imbalance in the vaginal microbiome, characterized by the overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria (Gardnerella vaginalis) and a decrease in the normal
protective lactobacilli. Bacterial vaginosis is a polymicrobial infection characterized by malodorous (fishy smell) vaginal discharge. causative organisms include:
• Gardnerella,
• Mobiluncus,
• Mycoplasma hominis
Bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed using Amsel's criteria:
Amsel's criteria: (any 3 should be present)
• Thin, white homogenous vaginal discharge
• pH of Vaginal fluid&gt;4.5
• Fishy odor of discharge accentuated on adding 1o% KoH (whiff test)
• presence of clue cells on microscopy. Many epithelial cells present with granular cytoplasm
caused by small gram-negative bacilli adhering on their surface, these cells are called clue cells.





Treatment is oral metronidazole 5oo mg BD for 7 days. Alternatively, Ampicillin 5oo mg or cephalosporin 5oo mg bid for 7 days is also effective.
other options:
option A: candida: presents with thick, white ""cottage cheese-like"" discharge, intense itching, and no fishy odor. whiff test is negative.
option B : chlamydia: often asymptomatic or causes mucopurulent cervical discharge and friable cervix. Does not cause a fishy odor or a positive whiff test.
option D : pelvic Inflammatory Disease (pID): causes pelvic pain, fever, and cervical motion tenderness. Not typically associated with malodorous discharge or a positive whiff test.",,C,
Q24,"A 14-year-old came with complaints of acute urinary retention. she has not attained
menarche and has cyclic abdominal pain. On genital examination, a bluish bulge is seen. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)Transverse vaginal septum
b)Imperforate hymen
c)MRKH
d)OHVIRA","This patient presenting acute urinary retention, cyclic abdominal pain, bluish bulge on genital examination and primary amenorrhea (no menarche), likely has imperforate hymen.
Imperforate hymen results due to failure of canalization of the inferior end of the vaginal plate. This anomaly usually remains unrecognized until puberty. It can lead to mucocolpos in early
infancy.
key Features of Imperforate Hymen:
• cyclic abdominal pain: caused by retained menstrual blood (hematocolpos) due to the obstruction.
• primary amenorrhea: Menstruation cannot occur due to the blockage.
• Bluish bulge: Hematocolpos causes distension of the vaginal canal, which can present as a bluish bulge at the hymen.
• urinary retention: The distended vagina (hematocolpos) can compress the bladder or urethra, leading to urinary retention.



ultrasound pelvis confirms the diagnosis.
Management: A simple cruciate incision of the hymen allows the free drainage of the collected menstrual blood, and leads to normal reproductive function.
other options:
option A: Transverse vaginal septum: would also cause primary amenorrhea and hematocolpos. Typically presents without a bluish bulge, as the obstruction is deeper in the vagina. Extensive     dissection and vaginoplasty is required.
option C: MRKH: Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome causes primary
amenorrhea due to absent uterus and upper vagina. There is no cyclic pain or bluish bulge, as menstruation cannot occur.
option D: oHVIRA: obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal anomaly: Rare condition with an obstructed hemivagina. often associated with renal anomalies and a functional contralateral
uterus, but it presents with cyclic pain later after menarche onset, not primary amenorrhea.",,B,
Q25,which of the following does not constitute a germ cell tumor?,"a)yolk cell tumor
b)Dysgerminoma
c)Juvenille granulosa cell tumor
d)Non gestational choriocarcinoma","Juvenile granulosa cell tumor does not constitute a germ cell tumor. It is a pure-sex cord tumor. Germ cell tumors:
• Dysgerminoma
• Endodermal sinus tumor (yolk sac tumor)
• Embryonal carcinoma
• polyembryoma
• Non-gestational choriocarcinoma
• Teratoma (Mature/immature)
• Mixed forms",,C,
Q26,which of the following is the smallest pelvic diameter at the brim?,"a)obstetric conjugate
b)Diagonal conjugate
c)True conjugate
d)Anatomical conjugate","The obstetric conjugate is the smallest pelvic diameter at the brim.
It is the distance between the midpoint of the sacral promontory to the prominent bony projection in the midline on the inner surface of the symphysis pubis. It is the shortest anteroposterior
diameter in the anteroposterior plane of the inlet and measures 1o cm. It represents the narrowest fixed diameter of the pelvic inlet that the fetal head must navigate. It cannot be measured directly  during a pelvic exam but is estimated using the diagonal conjugate.





other options:
option B: Diagonal conjugate:  It is the distance between the lower border of the symphysis pubis to the midpoint on the sacral promontory. It measures 12 cm. obstetric conjugate is derived by
subtracting 1.5–2 cm from the diagonal conjugate depending upon the height, thickness and inclination of the symphysis pubis.
option c and D : True conjugate: Also called anatomical conjugate, is the distance between the
midpoint of the sacral promontory to the inner margin of the upper border of the symphysis pubis and measures 11 cm.",,A,6258-3863.PNG
Q27,A female with abdominal pain and bleeding per vagina with 3 months of amenorrhea. on  examination her Bp was 9o/6ommHg. which of the following statements is/are true about ectopic pregnancy?,"a)1, 2
b)3,4
c)1,2,3
d)1,2,3,4","An ectopic pregnancy is one in which the fertilized ovum is implanted and develops outside the normal endometrial cavity.
clinical features :
The classic triad of symptoms is - abdominal pain (1oo%), preceded by amenorrhea of 6-8 weeks(75%), and lastly, the appearance of vaginal bleeding (7o%).
Abdominal pain is the most constant feature. (statement 1) pain is located in the lower abdomen. shoulder tip pain (25%) (referred pain due to diaphragmatic irritation from hemoperitoneum)
may be present.
pelvic examination - vaginal mucosa is blanched white; uterus seems normal in size or slightly bulky; extreme tenderness on fornix palpation(75%).
Risk factors of ectopic pregnancy:
• previous ectopic pregnancy
• Tubal corrective surgery, tubectomy
• Assisted reproductive technology



• Documented tubal pathology
• pelvic inflammatory disease (chlamydia infection and salpingitis isthmica nodosa), Genital tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases (statement 2)
• Endometriosis, pelvic adhesions
• prior abortion, prior caesarean delivery
• Multiple sexual partners
• progesterone-only pills (pops)
Diagnosis:
• serum ■rοg■■t■rone – concentrations are higher in viable IUps than in ectopic pregnancies
and IUps that are destined to abort, and measurement of serum ■rοg■■t■r■ne may be useful in a patient with abdominal pain and bleeding who has a serum hcG level below that expected for
the gestational age. However, the definition of low ■rοg■■terο■■ is unclear as there is no specific value to diagnose ectopic pregnancy. (statement 3)
• ß-hcG - lower concentration of hcG and doubling in plasma failing to occur in 2 days.
• Transvaginal sonography (TVs) features are absence of intrauterine pregnancy with a positive pregnancy test.
• color Doppler sonography can identify the placental shape (ring-of-fire pattern).
Management of ectopic pregnancy:
1. Medical management is preferred in the following cases:
• Low initial serum beta-hcG level (Less than 5,ooo IU/L)
• small ectopic pregnancy size (Less than 3.5 cm)
• Absent fetal cardiac activity
• Hemodynamically stable
2. Expectant management: A low initial serum hcG concentration, a considerable reduction in levels over 48 hours, and a sonographic inhomogeneous mass instead of a tubal halo or other   gestational features are predictive variables for success.
3. surgical management with salpingectomy or salpingostomy is done when:
• Gestational sac &gt;3.5 cm
• Fetal cardiac activity present
• Beta-hcG &gt;5ooo mIU/mL
• significant pain and hemoperitoneum
oral methotrexate is not the preferred route for treating ectopic pregnancy, as it may lead to variable absorption and unreliable dosing. Intramuscular injection is the preferred route of   administration for methotrexate in the management of ectopic pregnancy. (statement 4)",,C,
Q28,"A 32-year-old woman, G2p1L1, comes for a quadruple test at 16 weeks. which of the following is not included in the quadruple test?","a)Dimeric inhibin B

Q29,"An athlete with a BMI of 17.5 kg/m2 presentes with secondary amenorrhea and primary infertility. Her laboratory investigations reveal FSH 2 mIU/ml; LH o.32 IU/L; TSH
1.2mIU/ml. prolactin 2ong/ml. what is the underlying cause of this condition?","a)primary ovarian failure
b)Hypogonadotrophic Hypogonadism
c)Hypergonadotrophic Hypogonadism
d)Normogonadotrophic Normogonadism","The low FSH and LH levels, along with the low BMI, suggest hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.
BMI of 17.5 kg/m2 indicates low body weight, which can lead to hypothalamic suppression and a     disruption in the normal feedback mechanisms that regulate the menstrual cycle. FSH (2mIU/ml), LH (o.3IU/L): These values are low, indicating that the pathology lies at the level of the
hypothalamus or pituitary, rather than the ovaries. In hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, there is    insufficient secretion of gonadotropins (FSH and LH), which are needed for ovarian function. TSH (1.2mIU/ml) and prolactin (2o ng/ml) are normal, which rules out thyroid dysfunction or
hyperprolactinemia as the cause of the amenorrhea.
causes of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism:
• kallman's syndrome, prader-willi syndrome
• pituitary tumors, apoplexy
• Anorexia nervosa, excess exercise
• Irradiation, Infection,Trauma
Exercise-induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (EIHG): intense and prolonged physical   activity leads to a decrease in the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HpG) axis, resulting in lower levels of sex hormones. This occurs due to reduced secretion of
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which subsequently lowers levels of luteinizing



hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).
causes: Excessive physical training, especially in endurance sports. Energy imbalance (low calorie intake vs. high energy expenditure). psychological stress and overtraining.
Symptoms:
• Men: Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, and muscle weakness.
• women: Irregular or absent menstrual cycles (amenorrhea).
Management includes rest and reduced exercise intensity. Adequate caloric intake to correct
energy deficits. EIHG is a reversible condition with lifestyle modifications and is most commonly seen in athletes or individuals with excessive physical demands.
other options:
option A: primary ovarian failure (premature ovarian insufficiency) is associated with elevated     FSH and LH levels due to a lack of negative feedback from the ovaries, which is not the case here (FSH and LH are low).
option c: Hypergonadotropic Hypogonadism refers to primary ovarian failure, where FSH and
LH levels are elevated due to the lack of ovarian response. The low levels of FSH and LH here rule out this condition.
option D: Normogonadotropic Normogonadism would indicate normal levels of FSH, LH, and estrogen, typically seen in conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (pcoS). However, in this  case, the low FSH and LH levels suggest a hypothalamic or pituitary issue.",,B,
