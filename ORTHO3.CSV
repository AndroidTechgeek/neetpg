Q1,"Following a fall in the bathroom, an elderly lady is diagnosed with a fractured neck of the
femur. which of the following coexisting conditions is most likely to have predisposed to this injury?","a)osteoporosis
b)osteopetrosis
c)osteoarthritis
d)osteomalacia","Given the clinical history of an elderly woman experiencing a fracture following a trivial fall, which indicates a pathological fracture, the most probable predisposing condition would be  osteoporosis.
osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disorder characterized by abnormally low bone mass, which makes the bone unusually fragile and increases the risk of fractures.
A DEXA scan is performed in the following patients to assess bone mineral density and screen for osteoporosis, and the results are reported in terms of T-score or Z-score:
• Females aged 65 years or more
• Males aged 7o years or more



• post-menopausal females under the age of 65 years with risk factors
• Fracture after the age of 5o years
• Males aged 5o-69 with risk factors",,A,
Q2,At what age in women is a DEXA scan done routinely?,"a)At 5o years
b)At 55 years
c)At 6o years
d)At 65 years","Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA scan) is routinely done in women at 65 years of age to screen for osteoporosis.
osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disorder characterized by abnormally low bone mass, which makes the bone unusually fragile and increases the risk of fractures.
The criteria to screen for osteoporosis according to the national osteoporosis foundation is as follows:
• Females aged 65 years or more
• Males aged 7o years or more
• post-menopausal females under the age of 65 years with risk factors
• Fracture after the age of 5o years
• Males aged 5o-69 with risk factors
A DEXA scan is performed in the above patients to assess bone mineral density, and the results are reported in terms of T-score or Z-score.",,D,
Q3,Most specific feature for ankylosing spondylitis:,"a)HLA-B27 positivity
b)Bilateral sacroiliitis
c)Elevated ESR
d)Lumbar laxity","Bilateral sacroiliitis is the most specific sign of ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
while HLA-B27 is positive in up to 9o% of patients with AS, it is not specific to AS (option A). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRp) are often, but not always,
elevated and are not specific to AS (option C). Lumbar laxity is not a feature of AS (option D).
The Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society classification criteria for axial
spondyloarthritis includes lower back pain for more than 3 months in patients less than 45 years of age and one of the following:
• Sacroiliitis confirmed on x-ray or MRI and at least one typical clinical or laboratory finding
• A positive HLA-B27 test and at least two typical clinical or laboratory findings
Clinical and laboratory findings used in the diagnostic criteria for AS include:
• Articular manifestations: inflammatory back pain, dactylitis, arthritis
• Extraarticular manifestations: enthesitis, uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis
• patient history: positive family history, good response to NSAIDs
• Laboratory findings: positive for HLA-B27;  elevated CRp and/or ESR



HLA-B27 is strongly associated with the following conditions:
• Ankylosing spondylitis
• psoriatic arthritis
• Acute anterior uveitis
• IBD-associated ankylosing spondylitis
• Reactive arthritis",,B,
Q4,The treatment for the condition given below is:,"a)Extended curettage with allograft
b)Bone biopsy
c)curettage
d)Extended curettage with autograft","The provided radiograph of the knee joint shows an expansile, eccentric, subarticular, lytic lesion in the epiphysis of the distal femur with a soap bubble appearance, which suggests a giant cell
tumor (GCT). The recommended approach for management is extended curettage and autograft.
GCT or osteoclastoma usually affects young adults in the age group of 2o-4o years. The most common location of the tumor is the distal femur followed by the proximal tibia.
Important X-ray features of a GCT:
• A solitary, possibly loculated, lytic lesion in the epiphysis.
• Eccentric location, most often subchondral.
• Expansion of the overlying cortex.
• soap bubble appearance - The tumor is homogeneously lytic with trabeculae of the remnants of bone traversing it, giving it a loculated appearance called soap bubble appearance.
• No calcification within the tumor.
• No or minimal reactive sclerosis around the tumor.
The image below shows an X-ray of a giant cell tumor showing the typical soap bubble
appearance:




The treatment of choice for GCT is extended curettage and bone grafting.
• GCT in the relatively insignificant bone like the distal ulna, clavicle, and proximal fibula is treated by resection without reconstruction.
• Bisphosphonates have been shown to reduce the proliferation of osteoclasts and hence have been shown to stabilize local and metastatic disease.
• Radiation/embolization can be used for inoperable spinal or sacral tumors.
• Denosumab is approved for use in unresectable tumors in skeletally mature patients.",5257-3309.PNG,D,5266-3318.PNG;5267-3319.PNG
Q5,Identify the instrument given below.,"a)Bone nibbler
b)Bone curette
c)plate holding forceps
d)Bone holding forceps","The instrument given is a bone nibbler, which is designed to remove or shape small sections of bone by gently nibbling or biting away at the bone tissue.
It is available in various sizes and with different angles of the nose:
• Straight nibbler – for general use.
• Curved nibbler – for spinal surgery.
• Double-action nibbler – straight or curved. The double-action reduces the force required for cutting the bone and is mechanically superior.",5257-3308.PNG,A,
Q6,A 3o-year-old man presents with numbness of both hands. He was asked to perform the test demonstrated below. what is this test?,"a)Adson's test
b)pemberton test
c)Roos test
d)wright test","The test performed in the image is Roos test. It is also referred to as the elevated arm stress test (EAST). It is a provocative test for the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome.
For this test, the patient abducts the shoulders to 9o degrees and flexes the elbow to 9o degrees.    The patient is made to open and close the hand repeatedly for three minutes. The test is positive if



the patient is unable to complete the test or experiences cramping, pain, numbness, on the affected side.",5258-3310.PNG,C,
Q7,The test performed in the following video is,"a)Allen's test
b)Roos test
c)Adson's test
d)wright test","The test performed in the given video is Allen's test.
Allen's test is mainly used to test the adequacy of ulnar collateral blood flow to the hand, which is usually done prior to radial artery cannulation.
procedure:
• The radial and ulnar arteries are occluded as the patient makes a tight fist so as to exsanguinate the palm.
• Then the patient is asked to open the hand and the occlusion over the ulnar artery is released.


Interpretation:
• As occlusion of the ulnar artery is released, the color of the open palm is observed. Normally, the color will return to the palm within 5 – 6 seconds.
• If the palm remains pale for more than 6-1o seconds, it indicates reduced ulnar collateral flow.
• The modified Allen’s test considers a threshold of 5 to 15 seconds.
clinical significance:
• In recent years, studies have shown that, although the Allen test is often used to identify patients at increased risk for ischemic complications from radial artery cannulation, the predictive value of this test is poor.
• It is also used for identifying patients acceptable for radial artery harvest or use for coronary angiography.",5259-3311.PNG,A,5247-3296.PNG
Q8,"A child presents with difficulty in walking. on biopsy of the hip, some cells with grooved    nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm are present. which investigation would you order next?","a)MRI
b)serum calcium
c)serum PTH
d)CD1a marker","Histopathologically, cells with grooved nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm can be observed in both  Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and chondroblastoma. Therefore, the next step to differentiate between them would be to obtain a CD1a marker, which is typically positive in LCH.
The specific markers for LCH are CD1a and langerin (CD207)
It is worth noting that while an MRI can provide valuable information for evaluating the pathology, it is ideally performed before the biopsy.",,D,
Q9,"A 28-yr old man has recently finished a half- marathon. He complains of pain along the
anterior and medial aspect of the tibia which increases on jogging &amp; walking for a long time. Plain X-Ray radiograph of the leg was found to be normal. what is the probable
diagnosis?","a)Jones fracture
b)shin splint
c)Lisfranc fracture
d)Nutcracker fracture","The given clinical scenario, with a history of lower limb overuse (marathon running) and pain
along the medial tibial border which increases with activity (jogging and long walks), along with a normal radiograph, suggests medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), also known as shin splints.
MTSS is a stress injury of the tibia which occurs due to the frequent overuse of lower limbs. It is commonly seen in athletes and military personnel.
Exercise-induced pain along the distal two-thirds of the medial tibial border is typical. Since it is a stress injury, the radiograph of the leg appears normal.
Management is mainly conservative with rest and activity modification with less repetitive and load-bearing exercises.",,B,
Q10,"The following X-ray shows a lytic lesion of the lower limb. The biopsy shows fibroblastic proliferation, osteoclast and inflammatory cells. From the given options, the most likely  diagnosis that can be inferred from the above clinical picture is______.","a)Aneurysmal bone cyst
b)Giant cell tumor
c)chondroblastoma
d)Langerhan cell histiocytosis","The provided X-ray reveals a lytic lesion in the epiphysis of the distal tibia, and the biopsy, which shows osteoclast cells, suggests a diagnosis of a giant cell tumor (GCT).
Important X-ray features of a GCT:
• A solitary, possibly loculated, lytic lesion in the epiphysis.
• Eccentric location, most often subchondral.
• Expansion of the overlying cortex.
• Soap bubble appearance - The tumor is homogeneously lytic with trabeculae of the remnants of bone traversing it, giving it a loculated appearance called soap bubble appearance.
• No calcification within the tumor.
• No or minimal reactive sclerosis around the tumor.
The image below shows an X-ray of a giant cell tumor showing the typical soap bubble
appearance:





Histologically, GCT is characterized by the presence of a large number of osteoclast-like giant cells among scattered round or spindle-shaped mononuclear cells. The tumor stroma is
well-vascularized with bands of cellular or collagenous fibrous tissue.
The image below shows the histopathology of GCT:


other options:
option A: Aneurysmal bone cyst usually occurs in the metaphysis of long bones and the posterior elements of vertebral bodies. It is characterized by multiloculated blood-filled cystic spaces
separated by septae, composed of multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells and reactive woven   bone. Radiographically, an aneurysmal bone cyst is seen as an eccentric, expansile, lesion with   well-defined margins. Most lesions are completely lytic and often contain a thin shell of reactive bone at the periphery.





option C: Chondroblastoma is a benign cartilaginous tumor that occurs mainly in bones around  the knee joint. on x-ray, the tumor appears as a well-circumscribed, round, or oval lytic lesion in the center of the epiphysis of long bones, with areas of calcification within the tumor, giving the   characteristic mottled appearance. on histology presence of ""chicken wire calcification"" is
pathognomic.


option D: Langerhans cell histiocytosis commonly involves the skull, pelvis, femur, and mandible. Radiographs show a lytic lesion with periosteal new bone formation. In the skull, lesions appear     as a hole within a hole, and in the vertebra, vertebra plana (flattening of the vertebral body) can be seen. Histopathologically, Langerhans cells have a single large nucleus with a characteristic folded or grooved nucleus (“coffee-bean” appearance) with small inconspicuous nucleoli. on electron
microscopy, the presence of Birbeck granules in the cytoplasm is characteristic.",5260-3312.PNG,B,5251-3303.PNG;5270-3320.PNG;5271-3321.PNG;5272-3323.PNG
Q11,which of the following is used to stabilise a fracture of the distal femur as shown in the image below?,"a)Rail fixator
b)Ilizarov fixator
c)K wire binding
d)Interlocking nail","The above image shows a rail fixator.
In this type of external fixator, multiple pins are inserted into the bone. These pins are then attached to different blocks which can move over a track or rail.
Given below is an Ilizarov ring fixator. Here, pins are attached to an adjustable ring system.


Tension band wiring is used in the fixation of transverse patellar fractures. In this method, two K-wires are used to transfix the reduced patellar fragments and a flexible wire is looped around them tightly.





The following X-ray image shows tibial intramedullary interlocking nailing.",5261-3314.PNG,A,5272-3322.PNG;5273-3324-1.png;5273-3324.PNG
Q12,what is the type of scoliosis shown in the X-ray given below?,"a)congenital scoliosis
b)postural scoliosis
c)Infantile scoliosis
d)Degenerative scoliosis","In the given radiograph, the presence of a single hemivertebra at T9 and concavity to the right in the lower thoracic region is suggestive of congenital scoliosis.
congenital scoliosis is a lateral curvature of the spine which is always associated with a radiologically demonstrable anomaly of the vertebral bodies, which includes:
• Hemivertebrae (where only one-half of the vertebra grows)
• Block vertebrae (where two vertebral bodies fuse)
• An unsegmented bar (a bone bar joining two adjacent vertebrae on one side, which hinders growth on that side)



The image below shows a unilateral and unsegmented bar with contralateral hemivertebra:


In infantile scoliosis (option C), most curves are thoracic with convexity to the left and the anomalies described above are absent.
Note: The most progressive type of congenital scoliosis is a concave, unilateral unsegmented bar with a convex hemivertebra.",5261-3313.PNG,A,5274-3325.PNG
Q13,The following instrument is used for:,"a)Nibbling the ends of the bones
b)Holding the bone and plate
c)controlled traction of fracture segments
d)cutting the K- wire","The image shown is of bone holding forceps (verbrugge forceps). It is used to hold the bone and plate.
It consists of a ratcheted clamp with a curved distal end.",5262-3315.PNG,B,
Q14,A patient presents to the emergency department after he fell on his outstretched hand. An X-ray was performed and is given below. what is the diagnosis?,"a)colleIs fracture
b)RolandoIs fracture
c)Galeazzi fracture
d)Montegia fracture","The provided history of falling on an outstretched arm and the X-ray revealing an oblique fracture in the lower third of the radius with dislocation of the distal radio-ulnar joint point to the
diagnosis of Galeazzi's fracture.
Galeazzi's fracture is the fracture of the lower third of the radius and the subluxation or
dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint. This injury usually happens when one falls on an outstretched hand.
patients present with pain, swelling, and deformity at the lower end of the radius. on
examination, the disruption of the radio-ulnar joint can be elicited by pressing the lower end of the ulna. The ulna moves down and comes back like the key of a piano (piano-key sign).
The aim of treatment for this fracture is to preserve supination and pronation of the forearm. In children, closed reduction is usually enough to achieve perfect reduction. However, in adults,



open reduction using a k-wire fixation or compression plating is usually required. It is also important to look for ulnar nerve damage.
Galeazzi's fracture can cause complications such as malunion due to displacement of the fragment. This often results in deformity and limitation in supination and pronation.",5263-3317.PNG,C,
Q15,Identify the following device.,"a)cock-up splint
b)collesI cast
c)knuckle bender splint
d)Dynamic finger splint","The device shown in the image is a cock-up splint. It is used to manage radial nerve palsy.
Radial nerve palsy manifests as an inability to dorsiflex the wrist and digits (wrist drop and finger drop). Numbness occurs on the dorsoradial aspect of the hand and the dorsal aspect of the radial  3 1/2 digits. The cock-up splint is designed to counteract the wrist drop position by holding the
wrist in a slightly extended or neutral position, which helps prevent further contracture and allows for functional use of the hand.
other options:
option B: undisplaced colles' fracture is managed by immobilization in a below-elbow plaster cast for six weeks. Displaced fractures are managed by manipulative reduction followed by
immobilization in colles' cast in palmar flexion, pronation, and ulnar deviation.


option c: knuckle bender splint is used in cases of ulnar claw hand where ulnar nerve recovery is anticipated. The splint can be used to correct and prevent metacarpophalangeal hyperextension     by maintaining flexion as shown below.





option D: Dynamic finger splint can be used for:
• Immobilization in case of fracture of the proximal phalanx
• Extensor tendon injuries of the finger
• prevention of deformities in rheumatoid arthritis.
• post-operative immobilization.",5263-3316.PNG,A,5275-3326.PNG;5276-3328.PNG;5276-3327.PNG
