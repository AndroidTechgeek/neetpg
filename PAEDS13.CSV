Q1,"In a baby born with meconium-stained liquor, which of the following are recommended as per Neonatal Resuscitation guidelines?","a)1, 2, 3, 4
b)2, 4
c)3, 4
d)1, 3, 4","In a baby born with meconium-stained liquor, gentle suction of the nose and mouth is done in the case of a vigorous baby (statement 3), and positive pressure ventilation (ppv) is done in the case    of a non-vigorous baby after early steps (statement 4).
A baby born through meconium-stained liquor is classified as either a vigorous baby or a
non-vigorous baby. A vigorous baby has good breathing and normal tone, whereas, a non-vigorous baby has poor or no breathing with decreased tone. According to neonatal resuscitation
guidelines, in a vigorous baby, gentle suction is done and the baby is kept with the mother. In a     non-vigorous baby, the initial steps of resuscitation are done and is followed by ppv if the baby is not responding. Routine tracheal suctioning is not recommended (statement 2).
The response to neonatal resuscitation at various steps is assessed based on the heart rate.
• If the heart rate is less than 1oo, ppv (positive pressure ventilation) is provided with bag and mask and spo2 monitoring is done and adequate ventilation is ensured.
• If the heart rate is below 6o, then chest compressions are initiated over the lower third of the sternum at a rate of 9o compressions/min.
• Recommended rate of ventilation is 3o inflations/min. (9o compressions + 3o inflation = 12o events/ min). The ratio of compressions to ventilation is 3: 1.
• If the heart rate still remains &lt;6o, despite effective compressions and ventilation, then Iv epinephrine is given.
Note: For any baby, intrapartum suction of nose and mouth before delivery of shoulder is not recommended. (statement 1)",,C,5729-3634-1.png
Q2,which of the following has the least risk of perinatal transmission?,"a)HSV
b)CMV
c)Rubella
d)Hepatitis B","Rubella has the least risk of perinatal transmission.
Rubella or German measles has an intrauterine transmission that causes serious infection in
pregnancy which results in abortions or severe fetal defects if infection occurs in the first
trimester. The classical triad of congenital rubella syndrome is deafness, cataract, and congenital heart disease.
other options-
option A: Herpes simplex infection can be acquired in utero, intrapartum/perinatally, or during  the neonatal period. The intrauterine infection causes skin vesicles, eye findings (chorioretinitis, keratoconjunctivitis), and microcephaly/hydranencephaly. Intrapartum infection presents with    either:
• skin, eye, and mouth disease
• Encephalitis
• Disseminated disease with sepsis-like presentation
option B: cytomegalovirus, the most common congenital infection with perinatal transmission    presents with hepatosplenomegaly, petechial rashes, jaundice, chorioretinitis, and microcephaly. one of the long-term sequelae is hearing loss.
option D: Hepatitis B virus is associated with significant perinatal transmission. The most important risk factor that determines perinatal transmission is HBeAg.",,C,
Q3,which of the following is a new drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of Rett syndrome?,"a)olcegepant
b)Lasmiditan
c)Trofinetide
d)Erenumab","Trofinetide is the newly FDA-approved drug for the treatment of Rett syndrome.



The mechanism by which trofinetide exerts therapeutic effects in patients with Rett syndrome is unknown. It is a synthetic analog of the amino■terminal tripeptide of insulin-like growth factor
(IGF-1) designed to treat the core symptoms of Rett syndrome by potentially reducing
neuroinflammation and supporting synaptic function of the protein fragment glypromate
(GPE). IGF-1 is produced by both major types of brain cells – neurons and glia; IGF-1 in the brain  is critical for both normal development and response to injury and disease. Trofinetide has been    shown to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines, inhibit overactivation of microglia and astrocytes, and increase the amount of available IGF-1 that can bind to IGF-1 receptors.
It is Indicated for the treatment of Rett syndrome.
Adverse effects include diarrhea, vomiting, fever, seizure, anxiety, decreased appetite, fatigue, nasopharyngitis
other options:
option A: olcegepant is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist which was considered for the treatment of migraine, but discontinued.
option B: Lasmiditan is a nontriptan 5HT1F receptor–selective agonist and is used to treat migraine.
option D: Erenumab is a CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) blocking antibody used in the treatment migraine.
Note: The spelling of the drug in the options has been corrected from Trofinitide to Trofinetide.",,C,
Q4,"A 6-year-old boy was brought with a history of chronic cough, and foul-smelling stools. His     sibling who had similar complaints died a few years back. Sweat chloride test and CFTR gene studies were done. CFTR gene codes for proteins involved in the transport of:","a)Na+
b)HCO3-
c)Cl-
d)K+","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of cystic fibrosis. In this condition, CFTR gene codes for proteins involved in the transport of Cl- ions.
Cystic fibrosis or mucoviscidosis is an autosomal recessive disorder with a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7q. The most common CFTR
mutation is F508 deletion.
CFTR gene encodes for ATP-gated chloride channels in the apical membranes of epithelial cells. It regulates the flow of ions across epithelial membranes of sweat glands, respiratory airways,
pancreatic ducts, etc. The defect leads to high salt concentrations in sweat and viscous luminal secretions in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Excessive loss of salt in the sweat
predisposes young children to salt-depletion episodes. Therefore, these children present with hypochloremic alkalosis, resulting in increased serum bicarbonate levels.
Clinical manifestations/ complications of cystic fibrosis include:
• sinusitis and nasal polyps
• Respiratory - copious hyper-viscous and adherent pulmonary secretions with abnormal mucociliary clearance obstruct small and medium-sized airways leading to respiratory
compromise. The disease can be further complicated by bronchiectasis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).
• Gastrointestinal -



• Thick and adherent exocrine secretions obstruct pancreatic ducts and impair the production and flow of digestive enzymes
• Tissue destruction of the exocrine pancreas, with fibrotic scarring, cyst proliferation, and loss of acinar tissue - fat malabsorption, steatorrhea, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies
• obstruction of intrahepatic bile ducts and parenchymal fibrosis leading to hepatic insufficiency and focal biliary cirrhosis
• Distal intestinal obstructive syndrome in adults and meconium ileus in neonates
• Reproductive - males have infertility due to the congenital absence of bilateral vas deferens and defective sperm transport, resulting in obstructive azoospermia. Females have infertility due to    abnormalities of the reproductive tract secretions.
The diagnosis is confirmed if both of the following criteria are met:
• presence of
• Clinical symptoms affecting at least one organ system (respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary) or
• positive newborn screening or
• A sibling with cystic fibrosis
• Evidence of dysfunction of the CFTR gene by
• Two positive sweat chloride test results were obtained on separate days or
• Identification of two CFTR mutations by genetic testing or
• An abnormal measurement of nasal potential difference
Cystic fibrosis requires a multidisciplinary approach to management. The correction of the defect can be via:
• Lumacaftor, an FDA-approved drug that corrects the misfolding and reverts the phe508del mutation defect
• Ivacaftor potentiates CFTR channel opening and stimulates ion transport

Q5,"The perinatal transmission of infection shows the spectrum of anemia, possibly myocarditis, high output cardiac failure, and ascites. Identify the causative agent.","a)Treponema pallidum
b)CMV
c)parvovirus B19
d)Toxoplasma gondii","The given clinical vignette with anemia, myocarditis, high output cardiac failure, ascites and the    image showing hydrops fetalis point to a diagnosis of erythema infectiosum (Fifth disease) caused by parvovirus B19.
parvovirus B19 infects fetal erythroid progenitor cells and causes anemia. severe anemia leads to high-output cardiac failure and hydrops fetalis. In addition to bone marrow, the liver is also affected causing ascites, because it is involved in erythropoiesis in the early fetal life.
Erythema infectiosum presents as a prodrome oflow-grade fever, headache, and a mild upper
respiratory tract infection after an incubation period of 4-28 days. A characteristic rash occurs in
3 stages:



• Erythematous facial flushing causing a slapped cheek appearance in the 1st stage
• Diffuse macular erythema spreads to the trunk and proximal extremities in the 2nd stage.
• central clearing of the macular lesions, giving the rash a lacy, reticulated appearance in the 3rd stage.
The rash is more prominent on extensor surfaces and spares the palms and soles. At this stage,  affected children are afebrile and do not appear ill.  children with erythema infectiosum are not likely to be infectious at presentation.
complications of the disease include:
• Arthralgias or arthritis
• Transient Aplastic crisis: A transient arrest of erythropoiesis and absolute reticulocytopenia in serum hemoglobin in individuals with chronic hemolytic conditions like sickle cell anemia
• Thrombocytopenic purpura
• Myocarditis
• A papular-purpuric “gloves-and-socks” syndrome
• Neurological: Aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and peripheral neuropathy, stroke in children with sickle cell disease
• Infection-associated hemophagocytic syndrome in immunocompromised patients
• Maternal infection is associated with nonimmune fetal hydrops and intrauterine fetal demise
There is no data to support the use of IVIG for postexposure prophylaxis, however, it has been used with some success to treat B19-related episodes of anemia and bone marrow failure in
immunocompromised children. There is no specific antiviral therapy for B19 infection.",5715-3631.PNG,C,
Q6,In which of the following conditions is live vaccination not contraindicated?,"a)4 only
b)1 only
c)1 and 3
d)2 and 3","Live vaccination is not contraindicated in complement deficiency. In DiGeorge syndrome, wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and Ataxia telangiectasia, live vaccines are contraindicated.
In patients with DiGeorge syndrome, wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and Ataxia telangiectasia, there is a risk of severe or fatal infections due to live vaccines because of their impaired T-cell
immunity. In contrast, a patient with a complement deficiency has an intact T-cell and B-cell
immunity, which are crucial for building an immune response against live vaccines. These
patients have an increased susceptibility to certain bacterial infections, especially those caused by Neisseria species, due to defects in the complement system, which is part of the innate immune    system. But their adaptive immune system, which is primarily responsible for responding to
vaccinations, is generally intact. Therefore, live vaccinations are not typically contraindicated in these patients.
DiGeorge syndrome is due to a developmental defect involving the endodermal derivatives ofthe 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches. cell-mediated immunity is defective due to decreased T-cells.    Affected individuals also have depressed graft rejection, hypocalcemia, and cardiac defects. For    severe T cell deficiencies (e.g. severe combined immunodeficiency disease [scID], complete
DiGeorge syndrome), no live viral or live bacterial vaccines should be given.



wiskott-Aldrich syndrome(wAS) is an X-linked recessive immunodeficiency disorder. It is caused by mutations in the wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (wASp) that primarily affects the T
lymphocytes. In patients with partial T cell deficiencies (e.g., partial DiGeorge syndrome, wiskott-Aldrich syndrome), all live viral vaccines are avoided.
Ataxia telangiectasia is caused due to mutation of the ATM gene. This gene is involved in
the repair of double-strand DNA breaks. This defect in DNA repair leads to impaired Ig isotype
switching and the formation of antigen receptors. As a result, the patient is immunodeficient with partial T cell deficiency, and hence live vaccines are avoided.",,A,

Q8,An 18-month-old child with a 3-day history of watery diarrhea and vomiting presented with altered sensorium. which of the following are differential diagnoses?,"a)1, 2, 3, 4
b)1, 2, 3
c)1, 3, 4
d)2, 3, 4","The differential diagnoses in a child with a history of watery diarrhea and altered sensorium include severe dehydration, cerebral venous thrombosis, and hyponatremia.
The lack of dysentery(bloody diarrhoea) and the short period of interval between diarrhoeal
episodes and the symptom complex, help to rule out Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). HUS is a form of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia usually occurring in children less than 5 years of
age. There are 2 forms of HUS:
• Typical HUS which is usually followed by a gastrointestinal infection most commonly by E.coli. The infection in turn affects the gastric mucosa and alters the endothelial cells which promotes    platelet activation and aggravation.
• Atypical HUS which occurs due to deficiency in certain proteins like complement factor H, factor I, or cD46.
clinical features of the condition include bloody diarrhea which occurs 5-1o days before the onset of hemolytic uremic syndrome, abdominal pain, fatigue, cramping, and vomiting. The most
dangerous complication is renal failure requiring dialysis or renal transplantation. Treatment is



mainly supportive and the nature of the illness is usually self-limiting.
Differential diagnoses in a child presenting with altered sensorium/ seizures with diarrhea:
• Hypo- or hypernatremia
• Hypoglycemia
• Encephalitis or meningitis
• Febrile seizures
• Cerebral or saggital sinus thrombosis",,C,
Q9,The causative agent of this condition is associated with which of the following conditions?,"a)Gingivostomatitis
b)pure red cell aplasia
c)Molluscum contagiosum
d)kaposi sarcoma","The given image showing the classical slapped cheek appearance is strongly suggestive of
erythema infectiosum. It is caused by parvovirus. parvovirus B19 is associated with pure red cell aplasia.
Clinically, parvovirus B-19 infection may have several presentations-
• Erythema infectiosum- Also known as the fifth disease. The incubation period after infection is    typically around 1-2 weeks. The hallmark of erythema infectiosum is the characteristic rash, which appears initially as erythematous facial flushing, often described as a “slapped cheek” appearance.  Later the rash spreads rapidly or concurrently to the trunk and proximal extremities as diffuse
macular erythema. The child may be febrile.
• Transient aplastic crisis- It may be seen in patients with underlying chronic hemolytic
anemia like sickle-cell disease, thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis, and RBC enzyme
deficiencies like pyruvate kinase deficiency. patients with aplastic crisis appear ill with fever,
malaise, and pale with tachycardia and tachypnea due to profound anemia. The rash may or may not be present.
• pure red cell aplasia- Erythrocyte p blood group antigen is the primary cell receptor for the virus.
persistent parvovirus B19 infection in immunocompromised patients can cause chronic
suppression of bone marrow and chronic anemia leading to pure red cell aplasia.
• Maternal infection is associated with non-immune fetal hydrops and intrauterine fetal demise.
• only about 7% of children with erythema infectiosum have, whereas 8o% of adults have joint involvement.
• Infection-associated hemophagocytic syndrome in immunocompromised patients.
The diagnosis of erythema infectiosum is made clinically and does not require investigations
routinely. Detection of viral DNA in the blood by pCR or nucleic acid hybridization may be done for immunocompromised cases or for prenatal diagnosis of infection.
It is self-limited and resolves on its own. IVIG may be given to immunocompromised children.",5716-3632.PNG,B,
Q10,"A 4-year-old boy presented with a history of fever, conjunctival congestion, and erythematous desquamation of the skin as shown in the images below. A 2D echo shows a coronary
aneurysm. what is the first line of treatment for his condition?","a)Aspirin
b)IVIG
c)clopidogrel
d)LMwH","This child with a history of fever, conjunctival congestion, strawberry tongue, and erythematous desquamation of the skin is likely to have kawasaki's disease. The first line of treatment in
kawasaki disease is IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin).
kawasaki's disease is also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. It is a vasculitis
condition of unknown etiology.  clinical features include a high spiking fever that is unresponsive to antipyretics. The fever can last between 5 days to 3-4 weeks. The five principal clinical criteria   for kawasaki's disease are:
• Bilateral nonexudative conjunctival infection with limbal sparing
• Erythema of the oral and pharyngeal mucosa, strawberry tongue, and red, cracked lips
• Edema and erythema of the hands and feet
• Various forms of rash- maculopapular, erythema multiforme, scarlatiniform
• Nonsuppurative cervical lymphadenopathy
Diagnosis requires fever and at least four of the five principal criteria. Myocarditis develops
frequently in acute kawasaki disease. It presents as tachycardia and reduced ventricular systolic function. The tachycardia will be disproportionate to the fever. patients may develop coronary    artery aneurysms in the 2nd to 3rd week of illness. They are generally asymptomatic and
diagnosed on echocardiography. However, if large it can lead to death. Thus, echocardiography should be performed at diagnosis and after 1-2 weeks.
other symptoms include periungual desquamation, gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting,
abdominal pain, diarrhea), cough, rhinorrhea, and arthritis. Laboratory evaluation will reveal elevated leukocytes, platelets, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and c-reactive protein levels.
Treatment involves 2g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulin as an infusion over 1o-12 hours within 1o days of onset. Moderate to high-dose aspirin should be administered until the patient is
afebrile.

Q11,which of the following is not associated with Down's syndrome?,"a)conductive hearing loss
b)short stature
c)Hypothyroidism
d)caudal regression","Among the choices provided, caudal regression is not associated with Down’s syndrome. It occurs more frequently in infants of diabetic mothers (both preconceptionally and early
in pregnancy) than in other infants although the exact mechanism is unclear.
Down’s syndrome is an autosomal disorder. It was described by Langdon Down in 1866. It is also called trisomy 21 or mongolism. The clinical features of Down's syndrome seen in older children   are:
• short stature
• small round head
• Narrow tilted eye slits
• Mal-formed ears
• short broad hands



• Lax limbs
• Mental retardation
Conditions most commonly associated with Down’s syndrome:
• Congenital heart disease (in about 35% of cases)
• Gastrointestinal anomalies (in about 1o%)
• Chronic serous otitis media (in &gt;5o%)
• Conductive hearing loss
• Hypothyroidism
• Alzheimer’s disease (in the 3o's and 4o’s)
• Epilepsy (in about 1o%)
• ocular disorders
• Reduced fertility
• Reduced life span (often due to complications like infections)
The frequency of Down's syndrome increases with rising maternal age. The risk of a woman who is 2o is 1 in 3ooo but that of a woman who is 45 is 1 in 5o.
It seems to be unaffected by the age of the father.
Note: Genetic counseling: It can either be prospective or retrospective. Prospective genetic
counseling refers to the prevention of disease by the prevention or reduction of heterozygous
marriage like in sickle cell anemia or thalassemia. Retrospective genetic counseling means that the hereditary disorder has already occurred in the family and methods like contraception,
pregnancy termination or sterilization are to be used to avoid any serious health disorder in the unborn baby.
Methods of early diagnosis and treatment are early detection of genetic carriers, prenatal diagnosis, screening of newborn infants, and recognizing pre-clinical cases.",,D,
Q12,which of the following is correct about congenital CMV?,"a)4o-5o % of the cases are symptomatic at birth
b)optimum sample for PCR is blood/ urine/ saliva sample within 2-3 weeks of birth
c)If asymptomatic at birth, then there is a higher risk of developing SNHL later
d)Most common congenital infection after congenital syphilis","The correct statement regarding CMV infection is optimum sample for PCR is blood/ urine/ saliva sample within 2-3 weeks of birth
CMV is the most common congenital infection (option D). The clinical manifestations are
hepatosplenomegaly, petechial rashes, jaundice, chorioretinitis, and microcephaly. one of the
long-term sequelae is sensorineural hearing loss. Neuroimaging shows intracranial periventricular calcifications. other manifestations include IUGR, hydrops, microcephaly, pneumonitis,
chorioretinitis, seizures, abnormal dentition, and hypocalcified enamel.
only 1o% of the infected babies are symptomatic (option A). Asymptomatic neonates have lesser chances of having late sequelae i.e. sensorineural hearing loss. About half of the symptomatic
infants develop long-term sequelae which include sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), vision loss, seizure disorders, mental retardation, and developmental delay. However, in asymptomatic
infants, only about 13.5% develop long-term sequelae which is commonly SNHL (option C).



Diagnosis can be made by the presence of IgM antibodies in the fetal blood. Isolation of the virus from the urine or blood by PCR is more sensitive. The investigation of choice is PCR or viral
culture. It should be done within the first three weeks of life. After this period, it is difficult to distinguish between a congenital and an acquired infection. since not all affected infants are    viremic at birth, urine and/or saliva are more reliable samples than blood (option B).
There is no definitive treatment for congenital CMV infection. Treatment with ganciclovir is
indicated only in patients with progressive neurologic disease and deafness. Below is the image showing the blueberry muffin baby.",,B,5729-3634.PNG
Q13,"A 3.5 kg term neonate born to a mother with eclampsia, did not cry at birth. which of the following is the criteria for perinatal asphyxia?","a)APGAR persists at 4-7 for &gt; 5 minutes

Q14,Choose the correct statements for cystic fibrosis:,"a)i and iii
b)ii and iii
c)i and iv
d)ii and iv","In cystic fibrosis, there are increased chloride levels in sweat and decreased Chloride levels in    pancreatic juice. The chloride level of sweat, known as the sweat test, is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF). A sweat chloride level of &gt;60 mmol/L is diagnostic of CF.
Cystic fibrosis or mucoviscidosis is an autosomal recessive disorder with a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7q. The most common CFTR
mutation is F508 deletion.
CFTR gene encodes for ATP-gated chloride channels in the apical membranes of epithelial cells.
The function of the CFTR gene on chloride channels is organ-specific. In sweat glands, the normal function of the CFTR gene is to reabsorb chloride ions. But in the pancreatic ducts and respiratory airways, the normal function of the CFTR gene is to secrete chloride ions. So, in cystic fibrosis,
due to defect in the chloride channels, chloride levels in the sweat increase, and chloride levels in the pancreatic juices decreases. Excessive loss of salt in the sweat predisposes young children
to salt-depletion episodes. Therefore, these children present with hypochloremic alkalosis, resulting in increased serum bicarbonate levels.
Clinical manifestations/ complications of cystic fibrosis include:
• Sinusitis and nasal polyps
• Respiratory - copious hyper-viscous and adherent pulmonary secretions with abnormal mucociliary clearance obstruct small and medium-sized airways leading to respiratory
compromise. The disease can be further complicated by bronchiectasis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).
• Gastrointestinal -
• Thick and adherent exocrine secretions obstruct pancreatic ducts and impair the production and flow of digestive enzymes
• Tissue destruction of the exocrine pancreas, with fibrotic scarring, cyst proliferation, and loss of acinar tissue - fat malabsorption, steatorrhea, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies
• obstruction of intrahepatic bile ducts and parenchymal fibrosis leading to hepatic insufficiency and focal biliary cirrhosis
• Distal intestinal obstructive syndrome in adults and meconium ileus in neonates
• Reproductive - males have infertility due to the congenital absence of bilateral vas deferens and defective sperm transport, resulting in obstructive azoospermia. Females have infertility due to    abnormalities of the reproductive tract secretions.
The diagnosis is confirmed if both of the following criteria are met:
• Presence of
• Clinical symptoms affecting at least one organ system (respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary) or
• Positive newborn screening or
• A sibling with cystic fibrosis
• Evidence of dysfunction of the CFTR gene by
• Two positive sweat chloride test results were obtained on separate days or
• Identification of two CFTR mutations by genetic testing or



• An abnormal measurement of nasal potential difference
Cystic fibrosis requires a multidisciplinary approach to management. The correction of the defect can be via:

Q15,"one-day-old term neonate presented with respiratory distress, tachypnea, Spo2-8o%, and scaphoid abdomen. which of the following cannot be used in resuscitation?","a)Positive pressure ventilation
b)Endotracheal intubation
c)Bag and mask ventilation
d)oxygen suplementation","The given clinical scenario of a one-day term-old neonate presented with respiratory distress,
tachypnea, SpO2-80%, and scaphoid abdomen is suggestive of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Bag and mask ventilation is to be avoided in the management of this baby. Bag and mask
ventilation may increase abdominal distension and limit the expansion of the hypoplastic lungs. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a birth defect of the diaphragm. Malformation of the  diaphragm allows the abdominal organs to push into the chest cavity, hindering proper lung
formation and resulting in pulmonary hypoplasia. The most common type of CDH is
a Bochdalek hernia and in most cases involves the left side. CDH is a life-threatening pathology in infants and a major cause of morbidity and mortality due to two
complications: pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension.
Babies with CDH present with respiratory distress characterized by tachypnea, grunting, use of accessory muscles, and cyanosis. They may also have a scaphoid abdomen and increased chest  wall diameter. Auscultation of the chest may reveal bowel sounds with reduced breath sounds.
Diagnosis: A chest radiograph and nasogastric tube passage can confirm the diagnosis of CDH. prenatal diagnosis can be made using ultrasonography between 16 to 24 weeks of gestation.
High-speed fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can further define the lesion.
Management ofCDH:
The immediate step in the management is the naso- or orogastric tube placement
for decompression. The airway is to be secured with endotracheal intubation and respiratory distress is stabilised.
Inhaled nitric oxide is used widely for its pulmonary vasodilatory effect. Conventional mechanical ventilation, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), and extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO) are the 3 main strategies to support respiratory failure in newborn with CDH.
Surgical repair of the defect is to be considered at least 48 hours after stabilization and resolution of pulmonary hypertension. During surgery, the viscera are reduced into the abdominal cavity,
and the posterolateral defect in the diaphragm is closed using interrupted, nonabsorbable sutures.",,C,
Q16,"A child with type 1 DM presents with acidosis, and blood sugar 4oo mg/dl. what is the further management?","a)IV insulin stat
b)Normal saline with sC insulin stat
c)Normal saline followed by insulin infusion after 1 hour
d)Normal saline and insulin infusion immediately","A given clinical scenario of a child with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) presenting with acidosis and a high blood sugar level (hyperglycemia) describes a scenario suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis     (DKA), a serious complication of uncontrolled diabetes. the further management would be Normal saline followed by insulin infusion after 1 hour.
The International Society for pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISpAD) guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis)
in children and adolescents.
Diabetic ketoacidosis is the most serious complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus. clinical manifestations of diabetic ketoacidosis include:
• Dehydration, tachypnea with deep, sighing respiration (Kussmaul breathing)
• Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain that may mimic an acute abdominal condition
• confusion, drowsiness, and coma in severe cases.
The diagnosis of DKA is based on the triad of hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis. All three biochemical criteria are required to diagnose DKA
• Hyperglycemia (blood glucose &gt;2oo mg/dl)
• Venous pH &lt; 7.3 or serum bicarbonate &lt;18 mmol/L
• Ketonemia or ketonuria
Initial management includes management of the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABc)   according to pediatric Advanced Life Support (pALS) guidelines. Following that emergency assessment is done, which includes:
• Immediate measurement of blood glucose, blood or urine ketones, serum electrolytes and blood gases
• Assessment of level of consciousness.
• Two peripheral intravenous (IV) lines should be inserted.
The goal of therapy is to correct dehydration, correct acidosis, reverse ketosis, and gradually blood glucose concentration to near normal. Monitor for acute complications, and identify and treat any precipitating event.
Fluid replacement should always begin before starting insulin therapy. one or more boluses of o.9% saline at 1o-2o mL/kg are given to restore peripheral circulation. Insulin
therapy with o.o5–o.1 U/kg/hr must begin at least 1 hour after starting fluid replacement therapy. Insulin of o.o5 U/kg/hr can be considered if pH is &gt; 7.15.
potassium replacement is given only when potassium is &lt;5.5 mmol/L. In rare cases of hypokalemia with potassium &lt;3.o mmol/L, defer insulin treatment.
Bicarbonate administration is not recommended except for treatment of severe acidosis (pH &lt;

Q17,"A 9-month-old child is brought to the PHC with a fever and cough. she is feeding well and has normal urine output. on examination, a respiratory rate of 48 breaths/min is found and no      chest indrawing is seen. what is the next step of management?","a)Explain danger signs and send home
b)No pneumonia - Give amoxyclav + paracetamol and send home
c)start IV ceftriaxone
d)Refer as the child has severe pneumonia","In the given clinical scenario, a 9-month-old child with normal breathing (&gt; 5o/min RR for
infants 2 months to 12 months is considered as fast breathing) and no chest indrawing is seen. so, the next step in management would be to explain danger signs and send them home.
According to the IMNcI, three key clinical signs are used to assess a sick child with suspected pneumonia:
• Respiratory rate (RR): distinguishes children who have pneumonia from those who do not.
children are classified under pneumonia if:
• &gt; 6o breaths per minute if age  is &lt; 2 months
• &gt; 5o/min RR for infants 2 months to 12 months
• &gt; 4o/min RR for children 12 months to 5 years of age
• Lower chest wall indrawing refers to the indrawing of the lower chest wall with respect to the child's breathing and indicates pneumonia
• stridor indicates those with severe pneumonia requiring hospital admission.
The revised classification of acute respiratory infections is simplified to include only two categories of pneumonia:
• cough and cold, no pneumonia - requires home remedy
• pneumonia - with fast breathing and/or chest indrawing, which requires home therapy with oral amoxicillin.
• severe pneumonia - pneumonia with any general danger sign, which requires a referral and injectable therapy.
Danger signs of severe pneumonia are:
• Not able to drink



• persistent vomiting
• convulsions
• Lethargic or unconscious
• stridor in a calm child
• severe malnutrition",,A,5733-3635-1.png
