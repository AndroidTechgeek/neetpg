Q1,which of the following is a component of the neuromuscular criteria for maturity according to the expanded New Ballard score?,"a)Heel-knee test
b)Finger-nose test
c)Scarf sign
d)cubital angle","scarf sign is a component of the neuromuscular criteria for maturity according to the expanded new Ballard score.
scarf sign: If the infant's arm is pulled medially across the chest (as shown in the image below),
• In a hypotonic infant, the elbow will cross the midline.
• In a term infant with a normal tone, the elbow will not reach the midline.





Neuromuscular criteria for maturity (according to the expanded New Ballard score) include:
• posture
• square window (wrist)
• Arm recoil
• popliteal angle
• scarf sign
• Heel to ear
physical criteria for maturity (according to the expanded New Ballard score) include:
• skin
• Lanugo
• Eye/ear
• plantar crease
• Breast
• Genitals
The expanded new Ballard score is used to assess the physical and neuromuscular maturity of the newborn by scoring six criteria and thereby calculating the gestational age. It is accurate
between 2o to 44 weeks.
The lowest score on the expanded New Ballard score is -1o, which corresponds to 2o
weeks gestational age, and the highest score is 5o, which corresponds to 44 weeks gestational age.
An increase in the score by 5 points corresponds to an increase of 2 weeks gestational age    Given in the image below is the scoring system for the physical and neuromuscular criteria:",,C,5541-3537.PNG;5542-3538.PNG
Q2,"An 18-month-old baby was brought to the hospital with complaints of poor feeding and
abnormal twitching of his lower limb. on examination, he has fever with fontanelle bulging and the child was lethargic. The most probable cause is:","a)Febrile seizures
b)Meningitis
c)Pseudotumor cerebri
d)Intracranial haemorrhage","The clinical features of poor feeding, fever, seizures (abnormal lower limb twitching), bulging fontanelle (due to raised ICP), and lethargy are all suggestive of meningitis.
Febrile seizures (option A) are diagnosed in the absence of any other features suggestive of CNs infection.
Pseudotumor cerebri (option C) is rarely seen under the age of 1o years. There is an association
with obesity, female gender, pregnancy, and drugs such as tetracycline, vitamin A, and retinoid derivatives. It has a chronic course of illness, with papilledema being present in a majority of     cases.
Intracranial hemorrhage (option D) will present with seizures, focal neurological deficits, altered tone, and altered consciousness.
Bacterial meningitis may be caused due to Neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae type b.
Non-specific symptoms and signs include fever, rash, lethargy, refusal to feed, vomiting, etc.
specific symptoms and signs include photophobia, nuchal rigidity, bulging of the fontanelle, and  clinical signs of meningeal irritation (kernig and Brudzinski signs), but this is not usually seen in infants. seizures and focal neurological signs may be present.
The diagnosis of meningitis is confirmed by CsF analysis via lumbar puncture - which typically shows micro-organisms on gram stain and culture, neutrophilic pleocytosis, increased protein,  and decreased glucose concentration. Blood cultures should be done in all cases of suspected     meningitis.
Acute CNs complications include seizures, increased ICP, cranial nerve palsies, stroke, cerebral or
cerebellar herniation, and thrombosis of the dural venous sinuses. subdural effusions and non-communicating hydrocephalus may develop.",,B,
Q3,"A child presents with brown-colored urine and oliguria for the last 3 days. He has mild facial and pedal edema. His blood pressure is 126/9o. He has 2+ proteinuria with &gt;1oo red
cells/HPF and a few granular casts. His creatinine is o.9, urea is 56. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)PSGN
b)Nephrolithiasis
c)Posterior urethral valve
d)Minimal change disease","A child presenting with acute onset (3 days) gross hematuria, hypertension, edema, oliguria, and mild to moderate proteinuria is suggestive of a nephritic syndrome picture. The only disease
which causes this out of the given options is post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN).
PSGN is primarily caused by Group A β-hemolytic streptococcal infections in children aged 5 to 12 years. It is caused by immune complexes containing streptococcal antigens (M protein of cell wall) and specific antibodies. PSGN typically manifests as an acute nephritic syndrome, appearing
either 1 to 2 weeks after streptococcal pharyngitis or 3 to 6 weeks after streptococcal pyoderma.    The severity of kidney involvement can vary, ranging from asymptomatic microscopic hematuria   with normal renal function to gross hematuria with acute renal failure. Edema, hypertension, and oliguria may be present depending on the extent of renal involvement.
Laboratory findings commonly include a significant decrease in serum C3 levels during the acute   phase, with values returning to normal within 6 to 8 weeks. To confirm the diagnosis, evidence of a preceding streptococcal infection is necessary. The antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer often increases following pharyngitis, while the anti-deoxyribonuclease B level is a reliable indicator of cutaneous streptococcal infection.
Light microscopic examination reveals enlarged, hypercellular glomeruli with diffuse mesangial and endothelial proliferation, as well as leukocyte infiltration. Immunofluorescence analysis
demonstrates granular deposits of IgG and complement C3 along the glomerular basement     membrane (GBM) and in the mesangium. Electron microscopy primarily shows subepithelial humps, with subendothelial deposits observed in early stages of the disease.
Managing the acute effects of renal insufficiency (sodium restriction and diuretics)
and hypertension is the mainstay. Antibiotic therapy with a 1o-day course of penicillin is
recommended to limit the spread of nephritogenic pathogens. But antibiotics do not alter the
natural course of PSGN. Complete resolution ofthe hematuria and proteinuria in the majority of children occurs within 3–6 weeks of the onset of nephritis but 3–1o% of children may have
persistent microscopic hematuria, non-nephrotic proteinuria, or hypertension.

Q4,sign of effective neonatal resuscitation is:,"a)Color change
b)Bilateral Air entry
c)Increased heart rate
d)None of the above","An increase in the heart rate is the best sign of effective neonatal resuscitation. The response to neonatal resuscitation at various steps is assessed based on the heart rate.
As soon as a baby is born, the tone, cry, breathing efforts, and respiratory efforts are assessed. If the tone is poor, or if the baby is not breathing, the following measures are done immediately -
warming to maintain the normal temperature, proper positioning of the baby's airway, i.e. sniffing position with the head slightly extended, clearing of airway secretions, and tactile stimulation.
After the initial steps of neonatal resuscitation, the heart rate of the baby must be assessed. If the heart rate is &lt; 1oo beats per minute (bpm), positive pressure ventilation is provided along
with Spo2 monitoring to ensure adequate ventilation.
If the heart rate remains at &lt; 1oo bpm, ventilation corrective steps
and/or endotracheal intubation have to be considered. The ventilation corrective steps are as follows and can be remembered with the mnemonic MRSopA.
• Mask has to be reapplied
• Reposition head
• Suction the secretions
• open mouth slightly and ventilate
• pressure is increased slightly
• Airway may be changed
If the heart rate is &lt; 6o bpm, chest compressions are initiated over the lower third of the     sternum at a rate of 9o compressions/min. The ratio of compressions to ventilation is 3: 1 (9o compressions: 3o breaths).
If the heart rate still remains &lt;6o bpm, despite effective compressions and ventilation, then   epinephrine (1:1o,ooo solution at o.1–o.3 mL/kg intravenously or o.5–1 mL/kg intratracheally)  should be administered. The dosage can be repeated every 3–5 minutes. persistent bradycardia may signify inadequate ventilation or severe cardiac compromise.
The neonatal resuscitation algorithm is given below:",,C,5545-3540.PNG
Q5,Gene involved in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy:,"a)CHYNN-1
b)GABRA-1
c)FMR-1
d)All of the above","Mutation in GABRA-1 is associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.
Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), also known as Janz syndrome or impulsive petit mal, is the most common generalized epilepsy in young adults. It may be caused due to mutation in many  genes including CACNB4, CLNC2, GABRD, GABRA1, and Myoclonin1/ EFHC1
It typically begins between the ages of 12 and 18 (adolescence). The defining seizure type in JME is generalized myoclonic seizures, which occur in all patients. These seizures are typically mild     and primarily affect the upper extremities in the morning causing the patient to drop things.
However, they often go unnoticed and are only brought to medical attention after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, which tends to occur after sleep deprivation or alcohol consumption. some cases of childhood absence epilepsy may evolve into JME.
Diagnosis of JME relies on the patient's clinical history and electroencephalogram (EEG) findings. EEG typically shows bursts of generalized irregular 4- to 6-Hz spike-and-wave activity,
particularly after awakening. JME is generally a lifelong condition.
valproate is considered the most effective medication. Lamotrigine,
levetiracetam, and topiramate are also approved for JME.
The characteristic EEG pattern is shown in the image below:",,B,5546-3541.PNG
Q6,"A 3-week neonate presents with ambiguous genitalia with Na+ - 127; K+ - 6 meq/L with a BP of 5o/22 mm Hg. Along with IV fluids, what specific management is done?","a)spironolactone
b)Potassium binding resins
c)Hydrocortisone
d)Broad spectrum antibiotics","The given clinical case of a neonate presenting with ambiguous genitalia, hyponatremia,
hyperkalemia, and hypotension points towards a diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia   (CAH). Hydrocortisone must be administered along with IV fluids for the management of this baby.
The most common enzyme deficiency in CAH is 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Babies with
21-hydroxylase deficiency typically present around 1o-14 days of age with the subset of symptoms due to aldosterone deficiency, cortisol deficiency, and androgen excess.
Aldosterone deficiency leads to salt-wasting crises marked by hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis.
Cortisol deficiency causes manifestations like hypoglycemia, hyperpigmentation, weight loss, weakness, anorexia, vomiting, and shock.
Androgen excess in 21-hydroxylase deficiency results in virilization of females, leading to female     pseudohermaphroditism, and precocious puberty in males. Virilization is usually apparent at birth in females and within 2 to 3 years of life in males.
without treatment, shock, cardiac arrhythmias, and death may occur within days or weeks.
Diagnosis is confirmed by elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels or by genetic testing.
Glucocorticoid replacement therapy is the primary treatment for cortisol deficiency, aiming to suppress androgen production and prevent complications associated with androgen
excess. Fludrocortisone is given to control mineralocorticoid deficiency.
If the condition is diagnosed prenatally, dexamethasone may be administered to the mother.

Q7,"A 6 years old child with developmental delay, can ride a tricycle, can climb upstairs with
alternate feet, can say their name, and knows own sex, but cannot narrate a story. what is the developmental age?","a)3 years
b)4 years
c)5 years
d)2 years","The developmental age of a child who can ride a tricycle, can climb upstairs with alternate feet,
can say their name, and knows own sex is 3 years. Telling stories is a language milestone expected to be attained at 4 years of age.
The developmental milestones at 3 years of age are as follows:

Q8,The procedure displayed below is:,"a)Intubation
b)Nasogastric tube insertion
c)orogastric tube Insertion
d)oropharyngeal airway insertion","The procedure depicted is the insertion of an orogastric tube.
It is indicated in conditions like choanal atresia and cleft palate - where a nasogastric tube cannot be passed, or may cause inadvertant injury.
An orogastric tube is used to facilitate enteral rehydration and administer medications in children with dehydration or who are critically ill. It can also be used for gastric decompression in cases of



distention due to small intestinal atresia or stenosis.",5537-3534.PNG,C,
Q9,"An infant in the NICU was observed to have the features as seen in the video below. In
addition to these features, there is an audible grunt. what would the silverman Anderson score be?","a)8
b)6
c)5
d)4","In the given case, the baby shows a see-saw chest movement (2), minimal intercostal retraction
(1), visible xiphoid retraction (1), marked nasal flaring (2) and there is an audible respiratory grunt (2). The silverman-Anderson score of the baby would be 8 (2+1+1+2+2).
Given below is the silverman-Anderson scoring system (as per 2o22 IAP guidelines) to assess the severity of respiratory distress in a child:

Q10,"which of the following denotes an ""infant at risk""?","a)Infant of a working mother
b)Infant of mother who has not taken folic acid during pregnancy
c)Infant with history of premature birth at &lt;32 weeks gestation
d)Infant of mother with pre-eclampsia","An infant with a history of premature birth at &lt;32 weeks gestation will be considered a high-risk infant according to AIIMs protocols on Neonatology.
The inclusion criteria for high-risk neonates according to AIIMs protocol are:
1. Birth weight &lt;15oo grams
2. Gestation age &lt;32 weeks
3. Infants with a birth weight of ≥ 15oogm or gestation age ≥ 32 weeks with any of the following risk factors:
• Intrauterine growth centile &lt;3rd centile
• Meningitis
• Received mechanical ventilation for 48 hours or more
• Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy stage 2 or higher
• Major malformation
• Inborn error of metabolism/ chromosomal or genetic disorders/ intrauterine infections
• symptomatic hypoglycemia
• symptomatic polycythemia
• Retrovirus positive mother
• Hyperbilirubinemia requiring exchange transfusion oR Rh isoimmunization/cholestasis
• Abnormal neurological examination at discharge/ seizures



• Major morbidities such as chronic lung diseases, IVH grade III or more and periventricular leukomalacia
Note: Although park's Textbook of preventive and Social Medicine mentions infants of working   mothers (option A) as high-risk infants, premature infant with &lt; 32 weeks gestation is chosen over it, as AIIMS protocols are used as the preferred reference for AIIMS exams.",,C,
Q11,"A 7-year-old child presents with leg pain. She had fever and cough 3 days prior. Currently, there is pain on palpation of the calf muscles. Reflexes and other clinical examinations are normal. Lab test reveals Ck levels of 2ooo IU. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)viral Myositis
b)Duchenne
c)GBS
d)Dermatomyositis","The clinical picture showing pain in the calves occuring within a week of an upper respiratory
tract infection (URI), with elevated creatine kinase levels suggests the diagnosis of viral myositis. The specific history of URI suggests influenza myositis.
Infectious myositis has a male predominance and is typically seen in young adults. Childhood
form presents with fever, malaise, and rhinorrhea and is usually followed by severe pain,
especially in the calves. The muscle pain is usually worse with movement and the symptoms last for about a week. In children, toe walking and wide-based gait may be seen because of the
involvement of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscles.
other viral causes of myositis include HIV-1 (one of the most common causes of myositis), group B coxsackievirus (epidemic myalgia), HTLV-1 (Human T-lymphotropic virus), and
cytomegalovirus (CMV).
Lab features of influenza myositis include elevated Ck which may be as high as 5oo times normal the value. Urine myoglobin is usually positive. Detection of the virus with pCR testing of
nasopharyngeal specimens can be carried out but is not of much clinical significance. The
histopathological examination would reveal muscle fiber necrosis without much inflammatory change.
Treatment includes bed rest, IV fluids, and symptomatic management with analgesics and
antipyretics. Amantadine and other antiviral agents may be considered in adults. Complications   include myocarditis and respiratory dysfunction. Rhabdomyolysis is an uncommon complication.",,A,
Q12,"An 8-year-old boy with sensorineural hearing loss and eye defects presents to the OPD with hematuria. His renal biopsy on light microscopy was normal. Family history reveals the
maternal uncle had Gr 5 CKD an is undergoing dialysis. which of the following would be the probable diagnosis?","a)Alport syndrome
b)Goodpasture syndrome
c)IgA nephropathy
d)PSGN","The clinical presentation of a child with hematuria, sensorineural hearing loss, and eye
defects with normal renal biopsy is consistent with Alport Syndrome. It is a hereditary nephritis, which explains the family history of chronic kidney disease.
Alport syndrome is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CoL4A5 gene, which codes for the alpha chain of type IV collagen. In approximately 85% of cases, the syndrome is X-linked.
In the early years (around 5 years), patients are often asymptomatic but may have persistent
microscopic hematuria. Between 5 and 1o years of age, proteinuria, and hypertension may
develop, which can be managed with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. By 1o years of age, serum creatinine levels start to rise. Around 15 years, patients may experience ear, nose,
and throat (ENT) manifestations, with high-frequency sensory neural hearing loss being a
common feature in males. ocular manifestations, such as anterior lenticonus (pathognomonic) and dot and fleck retinopathy (most common), typically appear around the age of 2o. Anterior



lenticonus is particularly correlated with the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). By
25 to 3o years of age, most individuals with Alport's syndrome progress to ESRD.
Gross hematuria following upper respiratory tract infections is not typically seen in Alport's syndrome and should prompt consideration of other conditions, such as IgA nephropathy.
Skin immunofluorescence to demonstrate the lack of the α5(IV) collagen chain and genetic testing can be used for the diagnosis. Light microscopy and immunofluorescence (IF) on renal biopsy
may be normal. Electron microscopy reveals irregular areas of thinning and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), along with splitting ofthe lamina densa, giving it a   basket-weave appearance.
The mainstay of management is the control of hypertension and AcE inhibitors to slow down the progression of renal damage. Although transplant recipients develop anti-GBM antibodies, graft   survival is good.
Thin GBM disease is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by persistent microscopic
hematuria but no progression to ESRD or extrarenal manifestations. EM can be used to confirm the diagnosis, showing GBM thickness of less than 2oo nm.
other options:
option B: Goodpasture syndrome is an immune-mediated disease with antibodies against the
alpha-3 chain of GBM type IV collagen; it is not hereditary and the light microscopy would reveal extra capillary proliferation with crescents &amp; necrosis.
option c: In IgA Nephropathy, light microscopy would reveal focal mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis &amp; mesangial widening.
option D:  In post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), there will be diffuse endocapillary proliferation and accompanying leukocytic infiltration seen in light microscopy.",,A,
Q13,The following device shown attached to the baby is used in all except :,"a)In CPR
b)To know about apnea
c)In neonatal resuscitation
d)Measure central cyanosis","The image shows a pulse oximeter. It cannot be reliably used to measure central cyanosis.
A pulse oximeter employs spectrophotometry to measure the percentage saturation of oxygen at a peripheral site. In cases of markedly deranged hemoglobin (Hb) levels and abnormal Hb, pulse
oximetry doesn't correlate with central cyanosis, which depends on the absolute value of reduced Hb.
A pulse oximeter can be used for assessing response to resuscitation, titrating oxygen therapy in newborns, monitoring apnea (bradycardia and desaturation), confirming endotracheal tube
placement, evaluating the effectiveness of bag and mask ventilation, and monitoring for hypoxia during suction and laryngoscopy.
cyanosis is characterized by a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to
elevated levels of reduced Hb (more than 4 g/dL) or Hb derivatives. It is examined in the nail beds and mucous membranes, earlobes, lips, and fingers. It can be classified into central and
peripheral types.
central cyanosis can be due to reduced oxygen saturation or the presence of abnormal Hb
derivatives. causes include high altitudes, impaired pulmonary function, anatomic shunts, and



abnormal Hb. Both the mucous membranes and skin will be affected.
The absolute amount of reduced Hb rather than its relative quantity is significant in cyanosis. In  severe anemia, even with marked arterial desaturation, cyanosis may not be present. conversely, polycythemia patients are prone to cyanosis even at higher oxygen saturation levels.
The presence of abnormal Hb species may lead to errors in Spo2 readings. In a patient with
methemoglobinemia, the Spo2 will be 8o% to 85%, irrespective of arterial saturation (Sao2). A     patient with carbon monoxide poisoning will have a falsely elevated Spo2 level. A co-oximeter is a better device to measure abnormal hemoglobins.
carbon monoxide poisoning does not lead to true cyanosis. It causes cherry red discoloration.
peripheral cyanosis occurs due to decreased blood flow and excessive oxygen extraction from
normally saturated arterial blood. The mucous membranes ofthe oral cavity and sublingual
mucosa are spared. The causes include reduced cardiac output, cold exposure, and arterial
and venous obstruction. Here, the degree of cyanosis will generally correspond to Spo2 readings. However, the Spo2 levels may be falsely low despite normal Sao2.",5539-3536.PNG,D,
