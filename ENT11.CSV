Q1,"A post-COVID patient, who is a known diabetic, develops unilateral facial pain and loosening of teeth. which investigation would you do to confirm the diagnosis on this patient?","a)MRI
b)Biopsy with histopathologic examination
c)serum ferritin
d)HbA1c","The given scenario of a post-COVID diabetic patient with facial pain and loosening of teeth is suggestive of rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis. Among the given options, Biopsy with
histopathologic examination would be the investigation for definitive diagnosis on this patient.
Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis is the most common form of mucormycosis. It commonly occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus.
The presenting features are facial pain, numbness, loosening of teeth, conjunctival swelling,
congestion, and blurry vision. when the disease spreads to the orbit, proptosis can be present. It can later spread to the frontal lobe of the brain and cavernous sinus.
A definitive diagnosis is done with a biopsy and histopathologic examination. It is the most    sensitive and specific method. It reveals aseptate fungi with thick-walled, ribbon-like, hyphae branching at right angles.
Among the imaging techniques used for diagnosis, MRI is more sensitive to detecting orbital and   nervous involvement than CT. Contrast-enhanced MRI is the imaging technique of choice. 1,3 beta D- glucan assay, which is helpful for the identification of most fungi, cannot be used for the
diagnosis of mucormycosis.
Management is by amphotericin B and surgical debridement of the affected tissues. The
underlying cause and risk factors should also be addressed.",,B,
Q2,"A patient presents with the complaint of inability to close the eye, drooling of saliva, and deviation of the angle of the mouth. which of the following nerves is most likely to be
affected?","a)Facial nerve
b)Trigeminal nerve
c)Occulomotor nerve
d)Glossopharyngeal nerve","The given clinical features of inability to close the eye, drooling of saliva, and deviation of the angle of the mouth are suggestive of paralysis of the facial nerve.
Facial nerve paralysis can be central or peripheral. peripheral is more common and is usually idiopathic.
Bell's palsy is an acute onset idiopathic, peripheral facial paralysis. It is a lower motor neuron
lesion of the facial nerve and involves the ipsilateral side of the upper and lower halves of the face.
It presents with an inability to close the eye, and if the patient attempts to close the eye, it turns     up and out. This is known as the Bell's phenomenon. Other features include drooling of saliva and facial asymmetry. There may be noise intolerance and a loss of taste sensation.
Bell's palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion. All other possible causes of facial paralysis should be ruled out by investigations.
Treatment of Bell's palsy involves prednisone 6o-8o mg daily during the first 5 days and then
tapered over the next 5 days. Tape to depress the upper eyelid during sleep and artificial tears can be used to prevent corneal drying. Most patients recover within a few weeks or months.
The following image shows a patient with Bell's palsy.





other options:
option B: Lesions of the trigeminal nerve produce numbness and paresthesias, and loss of sensation in the area supplied by the trigeminal nerve.
option C: In oculomotor nerve palsy, there is ptosis, a dilated pupil, and the eye appears to be down and out due to the unopposed lateral rectus and superior oblique.
option D: Glossopharyngeal nerve lesions produce difficulty swallowing, and impairment of taste over the posterior one-third of the tongue and palate. There is also impaired sensation over the     posterior one-third of the tongue, palate, and pharynx, and an absent gag reflex.",,A,3324-2073.PNG
Q3,An adult man in a restaurant suddenly begins choking on his food. He is conscious. The following procedure was performed. Identify the procedure.,"a)Heimlich's maneuver
b)Back slap
c)chest thrust
d)Blind insertion of finger","The image shows a person standing behind with arms placed around the choking person's lower chest, giving abdominal thrusts, which is suggestive of Heimlich's maneuver.
The Heimlich maneuver (also known as subdiaphragmatic abdominal thrusts or abdominal
thrusts) is done for an adult or a child (1-8 years) with foreign body airway obstruction (FBAo). It is not recommended for FBAo relief in infants.
The rescuer should stand or kneel behind the patient and wrap his arms around the patient’s
waist. A fist is made with one hand and using the other hand, the fist is driven into the patient’s abdomen with a rapid, forceful inward and upward thrust to dislodge the foreign body. This is    continued until the foreign body is expelled or if the patient becomes unresponsive.
If the patient becomes unresponsive, immediately start cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).





other options:
option B: Back slaps or back blows can also be used to relieve FBAo. They are given between the shoulder blades using the heel of the rescuer’s hand, and up to 5 are given. If there is a failure of  the back slaps to relieve the obstruction, up to 5 abdominal thrusts can be given.
Infants (&lt;1 year) should be treated with alternating 5 back blows and then 5 chest thrusts. The infant's torso is placed on the rescuer's nondominant arm. It is shown below.






option C: Chest thrusts can be used as an alternative to the Heimlich maneuver for pregnant
women or markedly obese patients. The patient is supine, and the rescuer should kneel close to the victim’s side. Hands are placed in the same manner as is done to perform CpR chest
compressions. Each thrust is given in such a way so as to relieve the obstruction.
option D: The blind finger sweep should be avoided in infants to avoid pushing the object further  inside the airway. However, it can be done for unresponsive adults with complete FBAo. with the patient's face up, the mouth is opened by grasping both the tongue and lower jaw and lifting the    mandible. The index finger is inserted along the inside of the cheek and using a hooking action,
the foreign body is dislodged and removed.",3319-2069.PNG,A,3325-2075.PNG;3325-2074.PNG;3326-2076.PNG
Q4,"A patient presents with a firm, tender, slow-growing mass below the ear as shown in the image below. what could be the diagnosis?","a)Bezold abscess
b)parotid abscess
c)upper cervical lymphadenopathy
d)osteoma of the mandible","The given clinical scenario and the image are suggestive of a parotid abscess.
A parotid abscess refers to an infection and pus formation in the parotid space. It is caused most commonly by staphylococcus aureus. post-surgical cases and debilitated patients with stasis of    salivary flow are at risk of developing parotid abscesses.
patients typically present with unilateral swelling, redness, induration, and tenderness over the
parotid gland and angle of the mandible. Dehydration and fever are also present. Diagnosis is by   ultrasonography or a CT scan. Multiple small loculi of pus are seen in the parenchyma. Aspiration of abscess can be done to determine the culture and sensitivity of the infective agent.
Correction of dehydration, improving oral hygiene, and promoting salivary flow. Intravenous
antibiotics are also used in treatment. surgical drainage of the abscess is done via a preauricular incision.
The parotid gland is enclosed by deep cervical fascia which splits into superficial and deep layers. parotid space lies deep in the superficial layer. Contents of parotid space include :
• parotid gland
• lymph nodes associated with parotid gland



• facial nerve
• external carotid artery
• retromandibular vein
other options:
option A: Bezold abscess is a complication of acute coalescent mastoiditis and is formed
when pus breaks inferiorly, through the tip of the mastoid and collects in the upper part of
the neck. The onset is sudden with pain, fever, tender neck swelling, and torticollis. There will be a history of purulent otorrhea.
option C: osteoma of the mandible is usually slow growing and asymptomatic. It usually occurs in the mandibular condyle area. They are usually detected incidentally during a radiographic
examination.
option D: upper cervical lymphadenopathy occurs in the neck region following infection in the area drained by these structures.",3319-2068.PNG,B,
Q5,A 5-year-old child presents with reduced hearing for the past 2-3 months. The otoscopy finding is given below. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Myringitis bullosa
b)serous otitis media
c)Acute otitis media
d)pneumotympanum","The given clinical scenario of a child presenting with hearing loss for the past 2-3 months and the otoscopic finding is suggestive of serous otitis media. The given otoscopic image shows a dull and opaque tympanic membrane with clear effusion.
serous otitis media is also known as secretory otitis media or mucoid otitis media or glue ear. It is characterized by the accumulation of nonpurulent effusion in the middle ear cleft.
Glue ear is thought to happen due to either malfunctioning (adenoid hyperplasia, chronic sinusitis or tonsillitis or rhinitis, palatal defects, tumors of nasopharynx) or increased secretory activity of   the eustachian tube (allergy, unresolved otitis media, viral infections).
It is often seen in children of 5-8 years of age. They present with hearing loss not exceeding 4o dB, which is insidious in onset. speech may be delayed and defective due to hearing loss. Mild  earaches with a history of upper respiratory tract infection are usually seen.
on otoscopy,
• Dull and opaque tympanic membrane with loss of light reflex
• Thin leash of vessels along the handle of the malleus
• If the tympanic membrane is transparent fluid levels and air bubbles can be seen





The tuning fork test reveals a conductive type of hearing loss and audiometry reveals hearing loss  in the range of 2o-4o dB. on impedance audiometry, there is reduced compliance and a flat curve shifted to the negative side due to the presence of fluid. X-ray mastoid reveals clouding of air
cells.
Treatment is mainly aimed at the removal of fluid and preventing recurrence.
• Medical management includes decongestants, antihistamines, antibiotics, and middle ear aeration techniques.
• surgical management includes myringotomy and aspiration of fluid, grommet insertion, tympanotomy, or cortical mastoidectomy.
Chronic glue ear sequelae include atrophic tympanic membrane and middle ear atelectasis, ossicular necrosis, tympanosclerosis, cholesterol granuloma, and retraction pockets.
other options:
option A: Myringitis bullosa is characterized by painful hemorrhagic blebs on the tympanic membrane and deep meatus. It occurs due to infection by a virus or mycoplasma.
option C: Acute otitis media is an acute infection of the middle ear by pyogenic organisms. It
presents with marked earache and hearing loss is seen in later stages. otoscopy shows a red and bulging tympanic membrane.",3320-2070.PNG,B,3328-2077.PNG;3329-2078.PNG
Q6,"A patient comes with a history of asthma and sinusitis. on looking into his medical records, you notice this has been attributed to samter's triad. which drug should be avoided in this   patient?","a)cotrimoxazole
b)co-amoxiclav
c)Aspirin
d)chloramphenicol","In a patient with samter's triad, aspirin should be avoided as he will have aspirin intolerance.
samter's triad is also known as aspirin-induced asthma or aspirin-sensitive asthma. It consists of:
• Nasal polyposis
• Bronchial asthma
• Aspirin intolerance
patients with samter's triad will have persistent nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, anosmia, nasal polyps, and recurrent chronic rhinosinusitis. Asthma and aspirin intolerance develop later.
Acute asthma attacks usually occur 3 hours after intake of aspirin or NsAIDs. severe rhinorrhea, conjunctival injection, facial flushing, and periorbital edema are also seen. Aspirin-induced
hypersensitivity reactions also may occur.
patients should avoid aspirin and NsAIDs that inhibit Cox-1. Treatment may involve aspirin desensitization and endoscopic sinus surgery.",,C,
Q7,"A 7o-year-old male patient presents with decreased hearing in higher frequencies. It was
noted that the basilar membrane was affected. which of the following structures lie near the affected structure?","a)Modiolus
b)stria vascularis
c)oval window
d)Helicotrema","The affected structure in high-frequency hearing loss is the basal turn of the cochlea. Among the given options, the structure that lies near it is the oval window.
The traveling wave theory of von Bekesy states that a sound wave, depending on its frequency,
reaches maximum amplitude at a segment on the basilar membrane and stimulates that segment. The high frequencies are represented in the basal turn of the cochlea and the progressively lower  ones towards the apex.



The cochlea has a bony core called the modiolus, and a spiral canal that runs around it. At the
base of the canal, the two main openings are the oval window and the round window. The
footplate of stapes rests against the oval window. The base of the modiolus transmits nerves and vessels to the cochlea. (option A)
The inner ear consists of a bony labyrinth and a membranous labyrinth. The bony labyrinth
consists of the vestibule, semicircular canals, and the cochlea. The membranous labyrinth consists of the cochlear duct, the utricle and saccule, semicircular ducts, and the endolymphatic duct and    sac.
The cochlear duct has three walls- the basilar membrane, Reissner's membrane, and the stria
vascularis. The basilar membrane supports the organ of corti, which is the sensory hearing
epithelium. The length of the basilar membrane increases from the base to the apex. As a result of this, higher frequency sound is heard at the basal coil while lower frequencies are heard at the
apex.
The stria vascularis is involved in the secretion of endolymph and contains vascular epithelium. (option B)


The helicotrema (option D) is an opening at the apex of the cochlea, at which the scala vestibuli      and scala tympani communicate. The scala vestibuli, tympani, and media are three compartments of the bony cochlea.",,C,3330-2079.PNG
Q8,Identify the structure given in the image.,"a)Malleus
b)Incus
c)stapes
d)vomer","The structure given in the image is the incus.
It is one of the three ossicles that are in the middle ear cavity i.e, malleus, incus, and
stapes. ossicles conduct sound energy from the tympanic membrane to the oval window and then to the inner ear fluid.
Incus is shaped like an anvil. It has a body, a short process, and a long process. It has a
saddle-shaped articular facet on its anterior surface that articulates with the malleus. The long



process descends vertically and ends as a rounded lenticular process.
Incus has a single nutrient vessel within the long process and no collateral circulation. Thus, it is more susceptible to aseptic necrosis following a middle ear infection.
The malleus (option A) is the largest ossicle and is shaped like a mallet. The parts of the malleus are the head, neck, handle (manubrium), and anterior and lateral processes. The head and neck  lie in the attic. The tympanic membrane is connected to the handle of the malleus.
The stapes (option C) has a head, neck, footplate, and anterior and posterior crura. The annular ligament holds the footplate of stapes in the oval window.
The joints between the ear ossicles are synovial joints. A saddle-shaped joint is present between the incus and malleus. Incus and stapes articulate via a ball and socket joint.



option D- The vomer is a small bone in the posteroinferior part of the nasal septum. Along  with perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, and the septal cartilage, it forms the nasal septum.",3321-2071.PNG,B,3331-2081.PNG;3331-2080.PNG
Q9,A 2o-year-old male patient presents with unilateral nasal obstruction and recurrent bleeding for the past 1 year. Transnasal endoscopic results are shown below. A contrast-enhanced CT  revealed a mass extending from the posterior choana to the nasopharynx. what is the most   likely diagnosis?,"a)Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma
b)Antrochoanal polyp
c)Rhinoscleroma
d)Concha bullosa","The above clinical scenario with recurrent spontaneous bleeding with unilateral nasal obstruction and contrast-enhanced CT showing a growth protruding into the nasopharynx, along with the
transnasal endoscopic image, is suggestive of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma.
Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is a benign but locally invasive tumor. It is predominantly seen in   adolescent males and is thought to be testosterone-dependent. It arises from the posterior part of the nasal cavity near the sphenopalatine foramen.
The clinical features include epistaxis, progressive nasal obstruction, and denasal speech. other symptoms include conductive hearing loss, broadening of the nasal bridge, proptosis leading to  frog-face deformity, cheek swelling, and involvement of II, III, IV, and VI cranial nerves.
Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the head is the investigation of choice that reveals anterior bowing of the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus (Antral sign/Holman Miller sign), which is
pathognomonic of angiofibroma as shown below.


Carotid angiography shows the extent of the tumor with its vascularity. The feeding vessels mostly come from the external carotid artery. In large tumors with intracranial extension, vessels come
from the internal carotid system also.
Biopsy of the mass is avoided due to the risk of bleeding.
surgical approach is the treatment of choice. Embolization of the vessels can be done prior to surgery to reduce the risk of bleeding during the surgery.
Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy can also be considered.
other options:
option B: Antrochoanal polyp (killian's polyp) arises from the mucosa of the maxillary antrum. They are usually unilateral and are seen in children and young adults. They present
with unilateral nasal obstruction with minimal to no bleeding. X-rays of the paranasal sinuses



show opacity of the maxillary sinus.
option C: Rhinoscleroma is caused by a gram-negative coccobacillus klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. It causes this progressive granulomatous infection starting in the nose and extending into the
upper respiratory tract. It presents initially with foul-smelling nasal discharge, and then with
granulomatous nodules in the nose giving it a woody feeling. The last stage is the cicatricial stage, with stenosis of nares, and adhesions in the nose.
option D: Concha bullosa is pneumatization of the middle turbinate that leads to an enlarged middle turbinate, which is ballooned out.
