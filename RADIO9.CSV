Q1,"A 15 year old patient with history of spinal tuberculosis was brought to the hospital with low grade fever, dull backache and persistent flexion of hip joint. Hip joint motion was limited     and painful. Identify the muscle affected in the CT image.","a)1
b)2
c)3
d)4","The clinical vignette of a patient with low-grade fever, dull backache, and persistent flexion of the hip joint with a history of spinal tuberculosis is suggestive of psoas abscess involving the psoas
muscle, marked 2 in the given image. CT scan shows a mass in the psoas muscle lateral to the vertebral column which is diagnostic of the same.
psoas abscess occurs due to a collection of pus in the iliopsoas compartment. The compartment is retroperitoneal and hence, the abscess is also called a retroperitoneal abscess. The compartment    contains iliacus and iliopsoas muscles. The psoas compartment muscles lie in close proximity to    major abdominal organs and is richly supplied by iliolumbar, external iliac and common femoral   arteries. owing to these reasons, there is hematogenous spread of infections like tuberculosis
leading to abscess.
Clinical presentation is with back pain, fever, and lassitude. The hip may be in fixed flexion or there may be pain on passive extension.
CT is performed for diagnosis. Treatment is with percutaneous CT-guided drainage and antibiotic therapy.
other muscles marked in the image are depicted below.",3967-2525.PNG,B,3970-2528.PNG
Q2,"A 12 week old child presented with fever, cyanosis and fatigue. His chest X ray is shown below. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Total anomalous pulmonary venous circulation
b)Tetrology of Fallot
c)Transposition of great arteries
d)Pericardial effusion","The given X-ray shows figure of 8 or snowman appearance characteristic of total anomalous pulmonary venous circulation (TAPVC).
TAPVC refers to a condition in which pulmonary veins instead of draining into the left atrium
drain into the right atrium directly or indirectly. This results in anomalous drainage of pulmonary venous blood flow into the systemic venous circulation. It is a cyanotic heart disease with features of congestive heart failure. The patients are irritable and have failure to thrive.
The following types are seen:
• supracardiac (most common): Common pulmonary vein drains into superior vena cava or the left innominate vein
• Cardiac: Pulmonary veins drain into the right atrium or coronary sinus.
• Infracardiac (always obstructive and most dangerous): Pulmonary veins drain into portal vein or inferior vena cava.
snowman appearance is classically seen in supracardiac variant of TAPVC. The dilated vertical vein on the left, brachiocephalic vein on top, and the superior vena cava on the right form the   head of the snowman; the body of the snowman is formed by the enlarged right atrium. It is
shown in the image below.


other options:
option B: Tetrology of Fallot comprises pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, overriding of the aorta over the ventricular septum, and right ventricular hypertrophy. on chest X-Ray, the  cardiac silhouette appears like a boot (""coeur en sabot”).
option C: In the transposition of great arteries, the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk from the left ventricle. The X-ray shows cardiomegaly with cardiac contours    which appear like an egg on a string.
option D: Pericardial effusions occur when excessive fluid gets collected in the pericardial space. The X-ray shows globular enlargement of the cardiac shadow giving a water bottle configuration.",3968-2526.PNG,A,3971-2529.PNG
Q3,"A patient following a skid resulting in a motor traffic accident was brought to the emergency room 2 hours later. on examination, he was stable with GCS 15/15. The pupil was reactive to light. Tenderness and bruising over the left lower chest wall with petechiae was seen. Severe tenderness was elicited in the left hypochondriac region and BP- 9o/5o mm of Hg. what is    the best investigation used in the ER?","a)FAST
b)X-ray
c)Diagnostic peritoneal lavage
d)CT scan","FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) is the best investigation that can be  performed in the emergency room (ER) for this patient with a blood pressure of 9o/5o mm Hg who has sustained blunt abdominal trauma.
Focussed assessment with sonography for trauma is a non-invasive investigation that can be
performed rapidly in the emergency room. It helps in identifying an abnormal collection of fluid or blood. FAST is indicated in:
• Haemodynamically unstable patients who had a blunt abdominal trauma
• patients who sustained penetrating abdominal trauma with no other indications for immediate laparotomy (signs of haemodynamic instability, peritoneal irritation, peritoneal penetration and  gunshot wound with transperitoneal trajectory).
FAST includes an examination of four regions:
• pericardial sac
• Hepatorenal fossa
• Splenorenal fossa, and
• pouch of Douglas
It is an operator-dependent procedure with limited visualization of the retroperitoneal structures. other options:
option B - A chest X-Ray is used to exclude hemothorax or pneumothorax in a hemodynamically normal patient with penetrating trauma above the umbilicus or a suspected thoracoabdominal
injury. Since the given patient is alert, awake, and with no mention of any pelvic pain or tenderness, a pelvic X-Ray is not indicated either.
option C - Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is an invasive procedure and requires surgical expertise. For these reasons, it is done only in centres where FAST and/ CT are not available.
option D - CT scan requires transporting the patient and is time-consuming. Hence, it cannot be performed in the ER in a haemodynamically unstable patient.",,A,
Q4,A patient presents with abdominal pain and distension. An X ray was taken which showed dilated bowel loops as given in the image below. Identify the segment involved.,"a)Jejunum
b)Ileum
c)Duodenum
d)Transverse colon","The given clinical scenario and X-ray suggest intestinal obstruction where the involved segment is the jejunum. The obstructed bowel loops are central in location and show valvulae connivente
(mucosal folds that cross the entire diameter of the bowel) which is characteristic of jejunal    involvement. The gas bubbles trapped between the valvulae connivente give a string of beads appearance.
Radiological features of bowel obstruction
• Small bowel - The involved dilated segments are straight and usually centrally located.
• Jejunum - It is characterized by the presence of valvulae connivente with gas bubbles trapped between them. This gives a string of beads/ ladder effect.



• Ileum - The distal ileal obstruction is usually described as featureless.
• Caecum - A rounded gas shadow in the right iliac fossa is suggestive of caecal obstruction.
• Large bowel - The presence of haustrations is a feature of large bowel obstruction. Haustral folds are irregular and do not cross the entire diameter of the bowel. These are absent in the caecum.
In intestinal obstruction, fluid levels appear as the obstruction progresses. when the fluid levels are prominent, it indicates that the obstruction is advanced. The number of fluid levels also
increases if the lesion is more distal.
The most reliable criterion for the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction is the transition zone, seen on CT imaging. It identifies a definite point of obstruction. Dilated small bowel loops are seen
proximal to the site of obstruction and collapsed loops are seen distal to the obstruction.",3969-2527.PNG,A,3973-2531.PNG;3973-2530.PNG
Q5,"A child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia undergoes prophylactic irradiation prior to
autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. which of the following will be the least affected?","a)spermatogonia
b)Intestinal epithelial cells
c)Neurons
d)Bone marrow/ erythroid precursor cells","Neurons are least susceptible to radiation. The radiosensitivity of biological tissue is directly
proportional to its mitotic activity and inversely proportional to its degree of differentiation. This is known as the law of Bergonie and Tribondeau.
Hence, hematopoietic cells are the most radiosensitive, and the central nervous system is the least sensitive to radiation.
Acute Radiation syndromes (ARs) is an acute illness that is caused by exposure of the entire body to a high dose of penetrating radiation in a very short period of time. It is also known as radiation toxicity or radiation sickness. It consists of three syndromes:
stages of ARs:
• prodromal stage - This stage starts within minutes of exposure and may continue for a few days. symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and anorexia.
• Latent stage - It begins within a few hours and continues up to a few weeks. The patient generally feels healthy.
• Manifest illness stage - This stage may continue up to months and symptoms vary according to the syndrome.
• Recovery/ death - The recovery process occurs over two years. Recovery cannot be expected in cardiovascular and central nervous system syndromes, which lead to death.
