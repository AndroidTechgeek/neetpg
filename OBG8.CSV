Q1,A pregnant woman at 36 weeks gestation is found to have high blood pressure recording and  a urine protein of 3+. concomitant presence of which of the following symptoms would make you suspect imminent eclampsia?,"a)2 and 4 only
b)1 and 2 only
c)1, 2, 3
d)1, 2, 3, 4","The clinical case of a pregnant women at 36 weeks of gestation with hypertension and proteinuria points to a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. certain symptoms if present might suggest impending



eclampsia. These include 1, 2, 3, 4.
pre-eclampsia is defined as hypertension with blood pressure ≥14o/9o mm Hg along with proteinuria that develops after 2o weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive and
non-proteinuric woman. preeclampsia when complicated with generalized tonicclonic convulsions and/or coma is called eclampsia.
ominous symptoms of impending eclampsia:
• Headaches - usually over the occipital or frontal region
• visual disturbances - These could include scotomas. These are due to spasm of retinal vessels following retinal infarction, occipital lobe damage secondary to vasogenic edema, or retinal
detachment.
• Epigastric or right upper quadrant pain. This is due to hepatocellular necrosis, ischemia, and    edema that stretches the Glisson capsule. This is usually seen along with elevated serum hepatic transaminase levels.
• sudden and generalized or persistent edema may indicate imminent eclampsia. visible edema over the ankles despite rest, especially on rising from the bed in the morning hours is
pathological.
• Disturbed sleep
• Diminished urinary output - less than 4oo mL in 24 hours is considered a poor sign ominous other symptoms include:
• Renal or cardiac involvement
• obvious fetal-growth restriction
• Thrombocytopenia - usually due to microangiopathic hemolysis.
It is essential that the patient should be warned and educated against these symptoms. The
presence of these symptoms may warn the obstetrician and possibly avert the progression into eclampsia.",,D,
Q2,what is the probable diagnosis from the given clinical image?,"a)cervical carcinoma
b)uterine inversion
c)uterocervical prolapse
d)Fibroid polyp","In the provided image, it is evident that both anterior and posterior vaginal walls protrude completely outside the vaginal orifice, and the entire uterus is positioned below this level,  indicating a case of procidentia/ grade Iv utero-cervical prolapse.
utero-cervical prolapse is commonly seen in the elderly age group due to weak pelvic muscles. Differential diagnoses of genital prolapse include:
• vulval cyst and Gartner cyst.
• cyst of the anterior vaginal wall - tense with well-defined margins and cannot be reduced with pressure.
• urethral diverticula - small and located low in the anterior vaginal wall. urethroscopy aids in diagnosis.



• congenital elongation of the cervix - vaginal portion of the cervix is elongated without accompanying vaginal wall prolapse. The fornices are deep.
• cervical fibroid polyps - cervix is located high up and a rim of the cervix is felt above the pedicle of the cervical polyp.
• chronic inversion of the uterus- identified by the higher position of the cervix and the inability to define the uterus on palpation. Diagnosis is confirmed by the use of a uterine sound and further     examination with ultrasound and laparoscopy, which reveal a depression at the fundus and an
absence of the uterine fundus in the pelvis.
• Rectal prolapse.
The image below depicts the various degrees of genital organ prolapse:


other options:
option A: cervical carcinoma
It commonly presents with post-coital bleeding or postmenopausal bleeding. when they present   as cIN lesions, they can be identified by colposcopy but mass lesions will present with fungating, cauliflower, or punctate hemorrhagic lesions.
The provided image shows a normal transition zone, in the given setting without VIA or colposcopy it is difficult to diagnose the lesion as cA cervix.
The image below shows characteristic hemorrhagic and cauliflower lesions seen in the cA cervix:





option B: uterine inversion:
Acute uterine inversion is a rare and life-threatening post-partum complication. uterine inversion is associated with primiparity, the use of oxytocin, macrosomia, and fundal insertion of the
placenta. premature traction on the umbilical cord and fundal pressure before placental
separation are the usual direct causes. During per abdomen examination fundus of the uterus is felt to be absent. care for acute uterine inversion involves pain management, resuscitation, and  replacement of the inverted uterus before edema sets in by the o'sullivan method.
The image below image shows uterine inversion which can be identified by a completely inverted uterus.


option D: Fibroid polyp
They are leiomyomas that present as polyps. A fibroid polyp is generally firm, permanent, paler    than a mucus polyp, and is of various sizes. sonosalpingography is also a very good technique for detecting submucous fibroid polyp.



Note:
cervical fibroid polyps can be easily identified as the cervix is high up in its normal anatomical   position unlike in the given image. The image attached below shows degenerated fibroid polyps.",5983-3748.PNG,C,5999-3755.PNG;6000-3757.PNG;6000-3756.PNG;6001-3758.PNG
Q3,which of the following is not used to treat PCOD?,"a)Clomiphene citrate
b)Metformin
c)Tamoxifen
d)OCP","Tamoxifen is the best answer as it is not commonly used in the treatment of polycystic ovarian disease (PcoD). Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (sERM).
Treatment of PcoD:
• weight reduction alone is beneficial in mild hirsutism.
• Lifestyle changes, such as smoking cessation, are recommended.
• Fourth-generation oral contraceptive pills (ocP) containing ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone are used for treating menstrual abnormalities, reducing acne, and hirsutism.
• ocP with cyproterone acetate is prescribed for Pcos patients with hirsutism.
• Patients with PcoD are prone to developing insulin resistance, which can be controlled with metformin. Acarbose can be used as an alternative if metformin is contraindicated.
• Drugs used in the management of infertility in women with Pcos include letrozole and
clomiphene citrate. FoGsI, in 2024, updated letrozole as the first-line drug for induction of ovulation in patients with Pcos. However, the FDA approval for the same is still pending.
surgical options include laparoscopic ovarian drilling or puncture of not more than four cysts in  each ovary. This is done either by laser or by unipolar electrocautery. It restores endocrine levels and improves fertility. surgery is indicated only if:
• Medical therapy fails
• Hyperstimulation occurs
• Infertile women



• Previous pregnancy losses
Note: In cases where clomiphene and dexamethasone fail to induce ovulation, tamoxifen can be
considered as an alternative treatment for infertility associated with PCOD. However, it is not
recommended as the initial choice. It's important to note that tamoxifen carries a significant risk    of endometrial hyperplasia and can also result in unexpected pregnancy with potential teratogenic effects when used for induction.",,C,
Q4,"A 26-year-old woman who has had 2 children through normal delivery presents with a dull aching pain over the abdomen, with irregular menses. Per vaginal examination revealed a   mass felt through the posterior fornix. A USG showed a clear ovarian cyst of size 5 x 5 cm.  what is the next best step?","a)Measure CA 125 levels
b)Follow up after 6 weeks
c)Laparoscopy
d)CT pelvis","A clear ovarian cyst with size less than 7 cm in a woman of reproductive age group is most likely to be a functional ovarian cyst. The next best step in the management of this case is to follow up after 6–12 weeks and perform a repeat uSG.
A simple unilocular cyst under 7 cm is often a functional cyst and should be observed. Most
functional cysts resolve spontaneously within 4-6 months. A follow-up ultrasound will detect any persistent cyst, which may necessitate laparoscopic evaluation. To expedite resolution or to treat  symptoms like pain and irregular menses, oral combined pills may be prescribed for 3-4 months  in women of reproductive age.
Features of a functional cyst:
• Related to temporary hormonal variation
• Benign and rarely become complicated
• usually 6–8 cm in diameter
• usually asymptomatic
• unilocular
• Contains clear fluid, unless hemorrhage occurs
• Lining epithelium corresponds to the functional epithelium of the unit from which they arise
Management of functional cysts in women of child-bearing age group is summarized in the flowchart attached below.





other options:
option A: Tumour markers such as CA-125 and CEA are particulary useful in postmenopausal women suspected of having a malignant epithelial cell tumor.
option C: If the cyst does not resolve spontaneoulsy it can be removed laparoscopically or by laparotomy.
option D: Imaging modalities such as CT scan and MRI help to detect ovarian neoplasms and assist in staging of ovarian cancers.",,B,6003-3759.PNG
Q5,which of the following is not included in the quadruple screening test?,"a)Inhibin B
b)Unconjugated Estriol (E3)
c)AFP
d)hCG","Inhibin B is not a component assayed under the quad-screening test. Dimeric inhibin-A is evaluated in this screening test.
Quadruple testing is done in the second trimester between 15-21 weeks of gestation. It comprises:
• Maternal serum AFP
• Human chorionic gonadotropin
• unconjugated estriol (E3)
• Dimeric inhibin A
The following table summarizes the findings of the quad-screening test in various conditions.

Q6,The following set of instruments are used for which procedure?,"a)pap smear
b)Hysteroscopy
c)Biopsy
d)Dilatation and curettage","The given set of instruments are commonly used for the collection of pap smears. The given image includes Cusco's bivalved self-retaining speculum, koplin's jar, smear slides, Ayer's spatula, and
endocervical brush.


Pap/Papanicolaou test is a screening test only. The presence of abnormal cells/ a positive test requires further evaluation by colposcopy, cervical biopsy, or fractional curettage.
Screening guidelines:
• Time for initiation: 21 years, regardless of the age of first sexual intercourse.
• women aged 21-29 years: Every 3 years(earlier it was done annually)
• women who are aged 3o-65 years: Pap test + HPV testing every 5 years.



• women should stop having cervical cancer screening after the age of 65 years. If suspicious PAP, screening till 75 years.
• HIV+ women: annual checkup until three consecutive negative tests followed by testing every 3 years for life.
• HPV DNA testing in combination with PAP improves the sensitivity of screening. Prerequisites:
• should be done prior to vaginal examination.
• Lubricants should not be used.
• The patient should not be menstruating during the pap test.
• The ideal time is around ovulation.
• The patient should not have had intercourse in the 24hrs prior to the test.
Procedure:
• The patient is put in a dorsal position &amp; the labia are separated.
• Cusco’s self-retaining speculum is introduced/posterior vaginal wall retractor is used
• The squamocolumnar junction is identified and scraped with Ayre’s spatula.
• Endocervix is scraped with a cytobrush.
• samples are spread separately on 2 different glass slides.
• The slide is immediately fixed using 95% ethyl alcohol.
• stained with Pap stain or short stain.
other options:
option B: Hysteroscopy is the process of inspection of the uterine cavity.
The image shows the procedure of hysteroscopy and the common instruments used for the same.




option C: To take biopsy we commonly use Gellhorn's punch biopsy forceps as shown in the image below. It is used to take biopsies from the cervix.


option D: Instruments used in dilatation and curettage are shown below.",5985-3749.PNG,A,6004-3760.PNG;6005-3761.PNG;6006-3763.PNG;6006-3762.PNG
Q7,what is the fixative used for a pap smear?,"a)Formalin
b)Air dried
c)Normal saline
d)95% ethanol","The most common fixative used in pap smear is 95% ethanol (ethyl alcohol).
pap smear is a screening test for cervical cancer. Cervical cancer screening should start at age 21. women aged 21-29 should have pap smear every 3 years, while women aged 3o-65 should have    both HpV and pap co-test every 5 years.
Before the pap test:



• The pap test should not be deferred due to unexplained discharge or unscheduled bleeding as they may be signs of cervical or other genital tract cancers.
• Ideally scheduled to avoid menstruation. It is best performed around the time of ovulation.
• patients should abstain from vaginal intercourse, douching, tampon use, and intravaginal medications for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours prior to the test.
• Avoid touching the cervix before performing the pap test, as dysplastic epithelium may get removed.
• Ideally, confirmed cervicitis or vaginitis should be treated prior to the test procedure:
• The patient is put in a dorsal position and Cusco’s self-retaining speculum is introduced.
• The squamocolumnar junction is scraped with Ayre’s spatula completing at least one full rotation. It predominantly samples the ectocervix.
• Endocervix is scraped with a cytobrush, which is rotated only one-quarter to one-half turn after the ectocervix has been sampled.
• A broom simultaneously samples both endo- and ectocervix. Five rotations in the same direction are recommended, since reversing direction may cause loss of cellular material.
• samples are spread separately on 2 different glass slides and fixed using 95% ethyl alcohol.
• stained with pap stain or short stain.",,D,6007-3764.PNG
Q8,"A doctor tells a 31-year-old woman, who is 2o weeks pregnant, that her baby has a
developmental defect. She has come to you for a second opinion. The following USG finding is seen. Identify the defect.","a)Anencephaly
b)omphalocele
c)cystic hygroma
d)Encephalocele","The given ultrasound image shows an open defect in the calvaria and skin leading to the exposure of the cranial neural tube. This is consistent with the diagnosis of anencephaly.
Anencephaly results from incomplete closure of the neural tube. It is one of the earliest detectable congenital defects that can be detected as early as 1o to 11 weeks of gestation.  screening can also



be done by serum estimation of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP). The following are the radiological signs seen in anencephaly.
• Frog eye sign - Absence of cranial calvaria, prominent orbits thereby resembling the face of a frog.
• Shower cap sign - The absence of the cranium could lead to the protrusion of a disorganized     mass of brain tissue. This resembles a shower cap giving rise to a characteristic triangular facial appearance.
Many neural-tube defects can be prevented with preconceptional supplementation of folic acid. A dose of 4 mg daily is recommended in subsequent pregnancies.



other options:
option B: omphalocele is a midline anterior abdominal wall defect through which the solid
abdominal viscera and/or bowel may herniate. The extruded abdominal contents are covered in a sac. These are due to the persistence of physiological herniation of the gut or as a part of



the OEIS complex (omphalocele, exstrophy, imperforate anus, and spinal abnormality) and
cloacal exstrophy. The ‘elephant’s trunk’ sign on ultrasound, due to the prolapsed terminal ileum is said to be pathognomonic for cloacal exstrophy of the OEIS complex.
The first image below shows a patient with cloacal exstrophy showing the elephant trunk sign representing the intussuscepted ileum. The second image shows omphalocele while the third  image shows gastroschisis (a close differential diagnosis for omphalocele). The fourth image    demonstrates an ultrasound image of the fetus suggestive of an omphalocele (asterix)








option C: Cystic hygroma is a congenital multiloculated lymphatic lesion that is classically found in the left posterior triangle of the neck. It occurs as a result of sequestration or obstruction of
developing lymph vessels. It must be carefully differentiated from nuchal translucency (NT) as both may appear similar. This defect can be picked up in a first-trimester ultrasound.
The image below shows a newborn with cystic Hygroma on the right side of the neck and cystic hygroma of the neck in the fetus.






option D: Encephalocele is caused due to defects in the skull through which the meninges and/or neural tissue herniate. The squamous part of the occipital bone is the most frequently
affected bone. In meningoencephalocele or occult spina bifida with chiari malformations, the
scalloping of the frontal bones is observed in the ultrasound as the lemon sign while anterior
curvature of the cerebellum with effacement of the cisterna magna in the posterior fossa forms the banana sign.
The image shows a newborn with encephalocele. The second and third images below show the banana and the lemon sign respectively.",5986-3750.PNG,A,6008-3765.PNG;6008-3765-1.png;6009-3767.PNG;6009-3766.PNG;6010-3768.PNG;6011-3770.PNG;6011-3769.PNG;6011-3770-1.png;6011-3770-2.png;6012-3771.PNG

Q10,which of the following is a part of AMTSL?,"a)controlled cord traction
b)uterine massage
c)Early cord clamping","controlled cord traction during placental delivery is a component of active managament of third stage labor (AMTSL).
AMTSL is recommended by the WHO to prevent postpartum hemorrhage (PPH).
The recommended components of AMTSL are as follows:
Uterine massage or fundal massage is not recommended as an intervention to prevent PPH in
women who have already received prophylactic uterotonics such as oxytocin (core component of  AMTSL). Hence, it is now an optional component of AMTSL that is done in patients with uterine atony as a part of the management of PPH.

Q11,which of the following is not a cause of secondary amenorrhea?,"a)Turner's mosaic
b)kallman syndrome
c)Sheehan's syndrome
d)Asherman's syndrome","kallman syndrome is a not a cause of secondary amenorrhea. It is a cause of primary amenorrhea.
primary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menstruation by 14 years without the
development of secondary sexual characteristics or by 16 years regardless of the presence of
secondary sexual characteristics. kallmann syndrome presents with primary amenorrhea due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism from deficiency of GnRH. It is associated with olfactory
dysfunction and anosmia.
secondary amenorrhoea is the absence of menses for more than 3 months in girls or women who  previously had regular menstrual cycles or 6 months in girls or women who had irregular menses. sheehan's syndrome (postpartum hypopituitarism secondary to the necrosis of the pituitary
gland) and Asherman's syndrome (formation of intrauterine synechiae, usually following endometrial destructive procedures like curettage or ablation) are causes of secondary
amenorrhea.
Note: Turner's syndrome is a cause of primary amenorrhea. Turner's mosaic may present either    with primary or with secondary amenorrhea. so, of the given options, the best answer is kallman syndrome.
The image attached below summarizes the pathology involved in various types of amenorrhea.",,B,6014-3772.PNG
Q12,what should be the minimum percentage for normal sperm morphology in a seminal fluid analysis?,"a)1o%
b)4%
c)6%
d)8%","4% is the minimum percentage for normal sperm morphology in a seminal fluid analysis.
Morphology of sperms is the most important marker of male fertility. Characterization of normal sperm morphology shows improved correlation with fertilization rates during IVF cycles.
The criteria requires careful analysis of the following:
• The shape and size of the sperm head,
• The relative size of the acrosome in proportion to the head,
• And characteristics of the tail, including length, coiling, or presence of two tails.
Significantly decreased fertilization rates are observed when normal morphology of the sample falls below 4 percent.
Abnormal sperm morphology is termed teratospermia or teratozoospermia.",,B,
Q13,which of the following best measures ovarian reserve?,"a)Luteal phase LH
b)post luteal phase LH
c)FSH in the follicular phase
d)Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH)","Antimullerian Hormone (AMH), secreted by the granulosa cells, is the best marker of ovarian reserve as it can be tested on any day of the cycle.
AMH is secreted by the Sertoli cells in the testis and granulosa cells in the ovary. In males, it
inhibits the development of the Müllerian system and its absence can result in hermaphroditism.  In the female, it helps in follicular development and oocyte maturation. The estimation of serum   AMH is used in the study of ovarian reserve in an infertile woman and a woman with secondary    amenorrhoea. The levels ofAMH vary minimally across the cycle and they strongly correlate with the number of ovarian primordial follicles. This makes AMH is the best predictor for measuring    ovarian reserve. AMH levels can be affected by the use of oral contraceptives and tobacco
smoking.
Values and interpretation:
• Normal value: 2–6.8 ng/mL
• Poor ovarian reserve : &lt;1 ng/mL
• PCOD and hyperstimulation syndrome: &gt;1o ng/mL
Tests for ovarian reserve: Ovarian reserve means the capacity of the ovary to produce eggs. The other indicators include:
• FSH levels are measured in the early follicular phase (Day 2 or 3 of the menstrual cycle) - High FSH means the ovarian reserve is getting depleted (FSH is highest in postmenopausal women).   FSH (values &gt;25mIU/ml) levels are higher than normal in women with a reduced ovarian
reserve and ovarian hypofunction.
• Serum oestradiol values on day 3 of the cycle. Serum oestradiol &lt;75 pg/mL indicates ovarian hypofunction.



• LH - values &lt;1o IU/L indicates poor reserve
• Antral follicular count - counts less than 4–5 on days 2–5 denotes poor response to hormones.
• Inhibin B - values &lt;4o pg/mL indicates poor reserve",,D,
Q14,"An 18-year-old girl presented with amenorrhoea. on examination, she had normal genitalia &amp; normal breast development. Her tests reveal a 5 alpha-reductase deficiency. what     could be the probable diagnosis?","a)concealed sex
b)True hermaphroditism
c)Female pseudohermaphroditism
d)Male pseudohermaphroditism","A girl presenting with amenorrhea, normal female external genitalia and breasts with 5
alpha-reductase deficiency is suggestive of male pseudohermaphroditism.
In pseudohermaphroditism, the sex glands are of a certain sex while the external genitalia is of the opposite sex.
Male pseudohermaphroditism or male intersex is an association of male gonads (xy genotype) with female external genitalia. The production of testosterone from the testes requires 5
alpha-reductase. This enzyme converts testosterone into DHT (dihydrotestosterone), which is
capable of acting on peripheral target tissues to produce the male phenotype. The absence of this enzyme results in failure of the testis to descend to the scrotum and ill development of the penis, thereby resulting in the female phenotype. Many individuals develop their attitudes and psyche    according to their sex of rearing (as a female). Rehabilitation to their gender roles is the best line of management.
other options:
option A: Concealed sex refers to the deliberate concealment of sex usually done by criminals by changing clothes or by other methods to avoid detection. This can be detected by physical
examination.
option B: In true hermaphroditism the glands of both the sexes are present in the same
individual. such cases are very rare. In most cases, the accessory sex gland is atrophic and lacks functional activity.
option C: Female pseudohermaphrodites are genetic females (xx genotype) with male/ambiguous external genitalia due to the deficiency of 21 alpha-hydroxylase enzymes resulting in an excess of   androgens. This causes clitoromegaly resembling the penis,and the fused labioscrotal folds
resemble a rudimentary scrotum. Management includes administration of steroids to control
excess ACTH, estrogen to confer the secondary sexual characteristics, and surgical restoration of the external genitalia to a feminine pattern.",,D,
Q15,Match the following syndromes with their respective karyotypes.,"a)1-D, 2-C, 3-B, 4-A
b)1-B, 2-C, 3-D, 4-A
c)1-A, 2-B, 3-C, 4-D
d)1-D, 2-A, 3-C, 4-B","The correct answer is 1-D, 2-C, 3-B, 4-A.
Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, commonly referred to as Mullerian
agenesis, refers to the failure of development of the uterus, cervix, and upper part of the vagina in a female with 46 xx karyotype. These individuals have normally functioning gonads and external  genitalia.



condition	karyoty pe
1. Turner's syndrome	D. 45 + Xo
2. swyer's syndrome	c. 46+ Xy
3. Androgen insensitivity syn drome	B. 46+ Xy
4. MRkH (Mayer-Rokitansky -kuster-Hauser) syndrome	A. 46 + XX

complete androgen insensitivity syndrome/testicular feminizing syndrome:
In this syndrome, the karyotype is Xy and thus, the patient is a genotypic male. pathology is due to the defective response of the androgen receptors to androgens. Findings include:
• primary amenorrhea → Due to the absence of uterus and cervix.
• Normally developed breasts → Due to the conversion of the excessive androgens into estrogen.
• swelling in the inguinal region → suggestive of an underdeveloped ectopic testis, caused by loss of action of testosterone on its receptor.
• Absence of uterus and cervix → Due to the production of Mullerian inhibiting substance from the sertoli cells of the testis.
Note:
There is some discrepancy among authors on this topic. Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIs)
with Xy karyotype may have mostly female external sexual characteristics. According to william's  Textbook of obstetrics 26th edition, breast development occurs due to peripheral aromatization of testosterone to estrogen whereas the pubic and axillary hair remains scant or absent. But as per
shaw's Textbook of Gynecology 7th edition, Xy females with AIs have normal secondary sexual characteristics.
swyer syndrome or pure gonadal dysgenesis occurs as a result of a mutation in the sRy gene. This leads to underdeveloped, dysgenetic gonads that fail to produce androgens or anti-Mullerian
hormone (AMH). The following features are seen:
• Normal prepubertal female phenotype- Absent or poorly developed secondary sexual characteristics.
• Normal Müllerian system development due to the absence of AMH. (uterus and cervix present)
• Female external genitalia
• presence of dysgenetic testes that cannot produce AMH or sex hormones. They have a risk of malignant transformation.
As there is gonadal dysgenesis in a patient with 46 Xy karyotype, they are actually determined to be males and are a type of male pseudohermaphrodite. They present with primary amenorrhoea, absence of secondary sex characters, and female external genitalia.
Turner's syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality with partial or complete monosomy ofthe X    chromosome (45+Xo). In Turner's syndrome, gonadal dysgenesis causes primary ovarian failure



that is hypogonadism. The clinical picture of amenorrhea, short stature, webbed neck, low hairline at the back of the neck, widely spaced nipples, and lack of secondary sexual
characteristics is seen in Turner's syndrome.",,A,
Q16,which of the following complication is specific to Monochorionic twins?,"a)selective fetal growth restriction
b)polyhydramnios
c)Twin to twin transfusion syndrome
d)Neural tube defects","Twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTs) is a specific complication seen in monochorionic twins. selective fetal growth restriction, polyhydramnios and neural tube defects are seen as
complications to several conditions and are not specific to monochorionic twins.
In monochorionic diamniotic gestation, twins are separated solely by two amniotic membranes,    with no intervening chorion. Monochorionic monoamniotic gestation lacks a dividing membrane.
All monochorionic placentas likely have some anastomotic connections, unique to this type.
chronic feto-fetal transfusion may lead to the following clinical syndromes:
• Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTs)
• Twin anemia–polycythemia sequence (TAPs)
• Twin reversed-arterial-perfusion (TRAP) sequence Twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTs):
TTTs is a fetal syndrome in monozygotic twinning with two amnionic sacs and a shared chorion,   allowing for anatomical sharing of fetal circulations through anastomoses of placental arteries and veins. This leads to transfusion from donor twin to recipient twin, resulting in donor anemia and   restricted growth, while the recipient may suffer polycythemia, circulatory overload, and hydrops.
Features:
The Quintero staging is as follows:
• stage I—Discordant amnionic fluid volumes+ urine visible in donor's bladder.
• stage II—stage I + no visible urine in donor's bladder.
• stage III— stage II + abnormal Doppler studies of the umbilical artery, ductus venosus, or umbilical vein.
• stage IV— frank ascites or hydrops in either twin.
• stage V—the demise of either fetus.
Treatment:
• Laser photoablation of the placental vascular anastomoses is the preferred treatment for severe TTTs - Quintero stages 2 to 4.
• septostomy is seldom done.
• Amnioreduction is a treatment modality that involves needle drainage of excessive amniotic fluid.
• selective feticide is done only if the growth disturbances develop before 2o weeks.
• of all, selective fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (sFLP) by solomon technique is the preferred treatment modality as it is associated with better survival rates and a reduced likelihood of




recurrence.

secondary amenorrhoea is the absence of menses for more than three months in girls or women who previously had regular menstrual cycles or six months in girls or women who had irregular  menses.
premature ovarian failure or premature menopause is the development of menopause before the   age of 4o years. It is diagnosed when at least 2 serum FsH levels are elevated (&gt;4o mIU/l) when measured at least 1 month apart in a woman &lt;4o years. The other findings consistent with poF  include low estradiol and an elevated FsH/LH ratio.
Asherman's syndrome is the presence of uterine synechiae, due to the destruction of large areas of the endometrium, most commonly as a result of trauma to the endometrium following
pregnancy-related curettages. oligomenorrhoea, amenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea, abortion, and
infertility are seen with uterine synechiae. The laboratory investigations and hormonal assays are generally normal in isolated cases of uterine synechiae. Diagnosis is generally established using    hysteroscopy. Moth-eaten appearance on hysterosalpingography suggests a diagnosis
of Asherman syndrome. Treatment is by hysteroscopic adhesiolysis.
pcos is a multisystem, metabolic, endocrine dysfunction that commonly occurs among women in the reproductive age group. The endocrinological changes reflecting in the assays are summarized in the pearl attached below.
sheehan's syndrome/ pituitary apoplexy is hemorrhagic infarction of large pituitary adenomas or pituitary infarction due to traumatic major blood loss. If this blood loss occurs during
delivery, it's called sheehan's syndrome. Affected women may present
with panhypopituitarism and may have persistent hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and    lactation failure. The most prominent among symptoms are lactation failure (due to deficiency of



prolactin) and postpartum amenorrhea (due to deficiency of gonadotropins).

c)1, 2, 4, 6
d)1, 2, 3, 6","of the given list/combination of instruments 1, 2, 4, 6 are commonly used in the cesarean section. cesarean section is an operative procedure in which the fetuses are delivered through an incision  on the abdominal and uterine walls.
The given image summarizes the various instruments used in the lower segment cesarean section.





Bard-parker blade (scalpel with blade) has a handle with a notch to fit the blade. It is usually held by pencil grip. commonly for abdominal incisions, we use blade no: 22. other uses include
incision of skin and sub-cutaneous tissues, cutting the clamped pedicles, and performing sharp dissections.
The given image shows various Bard-parker blades.


Doyen's retractor is used to retract the abdominal wall as well as the bladder to facilitate better   exposure of the lower uterine segment during cesarian operation. It is also used to pull back the soft tissues to widen the surgical field during laparotomy.
The image below shows Doyen's retractor.





Alli's forceps: It is identified by the distal blades and a tip that has teeth that do not oppose each other. There is also a lock in the proximal part.
uses:
• To catch hold of the margins and angles of the uterine flaps in LSCS after the delivery of the baby in settings where the Green-Armytage hemostatic clamp is not available.
• To catch hold the anterior lip of the cervix
• To hold the apex of the episiotomy wound during the repair.
• To catch hold of the margins ofthe peritoneum, rectus sheath, vaginal mucosa during the repair.
• To catch hold of the torn ends of the sphincter ani externus prior to suture in the repair of complete perineal tear.
The given image shows Alli's forceps.




Green armytage forceps have a broad tip as shown in the image and hence are used to compress a wide area. It is used as a hemostat in caesarian sections. In LSCS (Lower segment Caesarean
section), the cut uterine edges can bleed and Green Armytage forceps are applied to the edge of the incision for hemostasis.


Cusco's speculum is a self-retaining bivalve speculum used for visualization of the cervix, vaginal fornices, and for performing pap smears.
The instrument shown in the image is Cusco’s speculum.


Shirodkar's uterine holding clamp has blades with curved transverse bars with gaps between them when it is locked. This gap makes it atraumatic and is used to lift, hold and steady the uterus

Q19,what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)vuval hematoma
b)condyloma accuminata
c)vulval cancer
d)Bartholin cyst","The given image shows a discrete growth on the left labia majora of the vulva. The most likely diagnosis is vulvar carcinoma.
vulvar carcinoma:
squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of vulvar cancer. The most common site of
vulvar cancer is labia majora &gt; clitoris &gt; Labia Minora. Persistent HPv infection and
chronic inflammation such as lichen sclerosis are risk factors. It is generally seen in elderly
women and presents with vulvar pruritus, vulvar swelling, lump, or an ulcer. The lump is papular with a raised pigmented area. The ulcers often have everted margins with fissured, cracked, and    indurated surrounding skin. They usually bleed and cause offensive vulval discharge.
The most common type of spread in vulval cancer is lymphatic while the vascular route of spread is extremely rare in vulvar cancer. The first lymph node to be involved is the superficial inguinal   lymph node and thus, a sentinel lymph node biopsy is helpful for evaluating the spread of vulval  cancer. Groin node status is the best prognostic predictor.
other options:
option A: vulval hematoma is a collection of blood in the vulval region. The symptoms include persistent perineal pain and rectal tenesmus. There may be retention of urine. The
local examination would commonly reveal a tense swelling at the vulva which becomes dusky and purple in color. It is mostly tender to touch. A small hematoma (&lt;5 cm) may be treated
conservatively with a cold compress. Larger hematomas should be explored in the operation theatre under general anesthesia
The image shows vulval hematoma. As it is a vascular leak a blue hue can be appreciated as the blood clots.





option B: condyloma acuminata (venereal warts) is caused by infection with Human papilloma virus 6 or 11. The verrucous growths may appear discrete or coalesce to form large
cauliflower-like growths. They may be asymptomatic, but can also cause discomfort discharge, or bleeding. A biopsy is necessary to rule out malignancy and the specific treatment includes
electrocautery, cryosurgery, laser, or diathermy.
The image shows multiple warty growths on the vulva and around the anal canal as seen in condyloma acuminata.


option D: Bartholin cyst is caused by obstruction of the Bartholin ducts by proteinaceous material or by inflammation from infection. Generally caused by gonorrhea and presents as a painful cystic swelling. symptomatic or recurrent cysts may require marsupialization or gland
excision. Bartholin abscess is a sequela to a cyst and it usually requires surgical drainage.

b)1, 2
c)1, 3
d)2, 3","Laparoscopy and Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) can be used to diagnose unicornuate uterus.
In the unicornuate uterus, the formation of the uterus and fallopian tube occurs entirely from one Mullerian duct due to the developmental arrest of other Mullerian duct. women with a
unicornuate uterus have an increased incidence of infertility, endometriosis, and dysmenorrhea.
Evaluation:
• The initial evaluation is through sonography. It can also help pick up ipsilateral renal agenesis, which is seen in 4o% of the women with unicornuate uterus.
• Saline infusion sonography (SIS) is another modality to identify Mullerian anomalies. It can be used as a screening tool for cavity evaluation as well.
• on Hysterosalpingography, the endometrial cavity usually assumes a fusiform (banana) shape, tapering at the apex and draining into a single fallopian tube. The uterus is generally shifted off  the midline.
• Invasive modalities such as hysteroscopy/laparoscopy are reserved for patients with complicated Mullerian anomalies or in patients presenting with infertility to establish the diagnosis.
• These days, MR imaging is used to characterize and pre-operatively evaluate cases that are complicated.

b)Fluconazole
c)Tetracycline
d)cefixime","The given clinical scenario of frothy vaginal discharge and strawberry cervix is suggestive of trichomoniasis and metronidazole is the drug of choice for the treatment.
Trichomonas vaginalis is one of the most common causes of vaginal discharge. It is transmitted
by sexual intercourse, with an incubation period of 4–21 days. The clinical features include
vaginal discharge which is profuse, thin, slightly green in colour, and frothy.  It may be associated with vaginal irritation, pruritus, dysuria, and increased frequency. cervical inflammation with
punctate hemorrhagic spots known as the strawberry cervix is typically seen. Motile trichomonads are seen on wet mount examination.
The below image shows the strawberry cervix seen in trichomoniasis.




Administration of metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose or 5oo mg 2 times/day for 7 days is the standard treatment. It should be taken at night and after meals to avoid vomiting. If this too
causes vomiting, or in resistant cases an alternate regimen is to be considered. Both the partners need to be treated simultaneously to avoid recurrence.

c)&gt;1o6 mg/dL
d)&gt;9o mg/dL","According to IADPSG, the cut-off value of fasting blood glucose for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is &gt;92 mg/dL.
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) refers to any degree of glucose intolerance having its onset or first recognition during pregnancy.
For IADPSG criteria, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is done in the fasting state using 75 g of glucose, and GDM is diagnosed if any one of the following cut-offs is met i.e.
• Fasting: &gt;92 mg/dL
• 1hour: &gt;18o mg/dL
• 2 hr: &gt;153 mg/dL
Earlier, a two-step approach was being used to diagnose GDM. In this, the first step (screening) is a 5o-gram one-hour glucose challenge test (GCT). The patients having a positive result of
&gt;14omg/dl, are candidates for the OGTT. A 1oo-gram, three-hour OGTT is the diagnostic test for GDM. GDM is diagnosed if two or more values are positive, as follows.
This has now been replaced by the one-step approach that omits the screening test and simplifies diagnostic testing by performing only a 75-gram, two-hour oral GTT.
Some complications of GDM:
• Maternal
• Hypertension, preeclampsia
• Hydramnios
• Increased operative interventions
• Future development of diabetes mellitus
• Fetal and neonatal
• Fetal macrosomia
• Congenital anomalies
• Metabolic abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and neonatal hypoglycemia.
• Respiratory distress syndrome
• Subsequent childhood and adolescent obesity

Q25,"A primigravida in her 1oth week of gestation presents with spotting. on examination, the uterus corresponds to 12 weeks. Transvaginal ultrasound was done and it is given below.  what is your diagnosis?","a)Blighted ovum
b)Missed abortion
c)Ectopic pregnancy
d)Hydatidiform mole","The given clinical scenario of a primigravida with spotting and an ultrasound showing a
characteristic snowstorm appearance (anechoic cystic spaces) is suggestive of a hydatidiform mole (complete mole). It refers to an echogenic uterine mass that has numerous anechoic cystic spaces. Hydatiform mole belongs to the benign group of gestational trophoblastic diseases (GTD). It is an  abnormality in chorionic villi making them partly proliferative and degenerative, thereby resulting in the formation of multiple small cysts. Based on the portion of the chorionic villi involved, they   could be complete (diffused) or partial (focal)
The classical clinical features of a complete mole are:
• Abnormal vaginal bleeding -Most common (9o%)
• Lower abdominal pain
• Hyperemesis gravidarum due to increased β-hcG
• Features of early-onset preeclampsia
• Uterus appears large for date
• Absent fetal parts and FHS
• Expulsion of vesicular tissues (grape-like vesicles)
• Theca lutein cyst of ovaries of more than 6 cm
• Hyperthyroidism (rare)
• Serum hcG &gt; 1oo,ooo mIU/ml
• USG - snowstorm appearance
The definitive management after diagnosis is suction and evacuation, after making the cervix favorable. Follow-up of the patients with serial hcG values is crucial.
prophylactic chemotherapy can be started on high-risk women (WHO prognostic score &gt; 7)     with methotrexate 1mg/kg/day intramuscular/intravenous on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. patients are also advised to not get pregnant for at least a year.



other options:
option A: Blighted ovum (silent miscarriage) occurs when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus but doesn't develop into an embryo. It is a sonographic diagnosis where there is an absence of a fetal pole in a gestational sac with a diameter of 3 cm or more.
option B: Missed abortion is when the fetus is dead and retained inside the uterus for a variable    period. USG shows an empty sac early in the pregnancy or the absence of fetal cardiac activity and fetal movements.
option C: Ectopic pregnancy is one in which the fertilized ovum is implanted and develops outside the normal endometrial cavity. The majority of ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube, the ampulla being the most common site.",5991-3752.PNG,D,
Q26,A 62-year-old patient with a history of diabetes and hypertension came with post-menopausal bleeding. which of the following you will do to evaluate the cause?,"a)pap smear
b)visual inspection with iodine
c)colposcopy
d)Endometrial sampling","Endometrial sampling is done to evaluate a patient presenting with postmenopausal bleeding.
postmenopausal bleeding is defined as any bleeding from the genital tract after 12 months of
menopause in a woman not on hormone replacement. Any vaginal bleeding occurring after 6
months of amenorrhea in a menopausal woman should also be considered as postmenopausal    bleeding and investigated. All postmenopausal women with unexpected uterine bleeding should be evaluated for endometrial malignancy since age is a significant risk factor for this.
Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) is a better first-line investigation. Since TVS is not included in the options, endometrial sampling is the next best answer.
Endometrial sampling is indicated if:
• The endometrial thickness is &gt;4 mm
• The endometrium shows diffuse or focal increased echogenicity (heterogeneity)
• The endometrium is not adequately visualized on transvaginal sonography
• The woman has persistent bleeding, as it can be a sign of endometrial cancer even when the endometrial thickness is less than 4mm.
The image below gives a summary of the evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding, as per the FoGSI guidelines.





other options:
option A: pap smear should be offered to all women above the age of 21 years who are
sexually active for at least 3 years. Colposcopic examination and selective biopsy are considered in patients with abnormal pap smears.
option B: visual inspection with iodine is done where the facilities for pap screening do not exist. This involves painting the cervix with Lugol's iodine. It is used to detect any abnormal cytology in the cervix and vagina, such as in cases of carcinoma cervix.
The normal vaginal and cervical epithelium contains glycogen, therefore stains mahogany
brown on being painted with Lugol's iodine. The abnormal cells remain unstained. These areas need to be biopsied and sent for histopathological examination.
option C: The colposcopic study is challenging in postmenopausal women because of narrow vaginas, senile vaginitis, indrawn and poorly visible squamocolumnar junction, and atrophic  cervix.",,D,6033-3785.PNG
Q27,which of the following is recommended by the wHO for the management of the second stage of labor?,"a)Mandatory episiotomy

d)Deliver in lithotomy position only","Among the given options, manual perineal support and giving warm compresses are
recommended by wHo in the management of the second stage of labor.
The second stage of labor refers to the time period between full cervical dilatation and the birth of the baby. For women in the second stage of labor, the following techniques to reduce perineal
trauma and facilitate spontaneous birth such as perineal massage, warm compresses, and manual perineal support (hands-on guarding of the perineum) are recommended.
option A: Mandatory episiotomy is discouraged. Episiotomy is indicated in cases of:
• shoulder dystocia
• Breech delivery
• Fetal macrosomia



• operative vaginal deliveries
• persistent occiput posterior positions
option c: Head is delivered by maintaining flexion to ensure that the small sub-occipitofrontal diameter distends the vulval outlet instead of the larger occipitofrontal diameter.

Q28,"A primigravida is in labour. Her per-vaginal examination revealed a posterior cervix with 5 cm cervical length, 1 cm dilatation, soft consistency, and head at -1 station. calculate the
modified Bishop score.","a)8
b)5
c)3
d)o","The Modified Bishop score of the given patient is calculated to be 5.
From the data given in the question:
• The position of the cervix is posterior, hence score = o
• cervical length is 5 cm, hence score = o
• cervical dilatation is 1 cm, hence score = 1
• consistency of cervix is soft, hence score = 2
• The station of the head is –1, hence score = 2
Hence, the Modified Bishop score is o+o+1+2+2 = 5.
The Bishop score is a scoring system used to assess labor induction outcomes. It is based on the  station of the head, dilation, effacement (or length), position, and consistency of the cervix noted by doing a vaginal examination.
According to the NIcE guidelines, a score of &gt;/=6 is considered favorable.

Q29,"A couple presents to the infertility clinic with a normal hysterosalpingogram and a semen
analysis report with azoospermia. which of the following is the next best test to differentiate between an obstructive and a testicular cause of azoospermia?","a)serum FsH levels
b)serum testosterone levels
c)Testicular biopsy
d)serum LH level","Serum FSH level is the next best test to differentiate between an obstructive and a testicular cause of azoospermia. FSH is the main hormone stimulating the production of sperm in the testis and
has the highest specificity and sensitivity among hormonal assays while differentiating between obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermia.
The absence of sperm in semen is known as azoospermia. It can be due to:
• pre-testicular azoospermia due to a hypothalamic or pituitary abnormality (hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism)
• Testicular failure or non-obstructive azoospermia
• post-testicular obstruction implies normal spermatogenesis but failure to deliver the sperm into the ejaculate because of ductal obstruction.



The algorithm for differentiating the causes of normal semen volume azoospermia is as follows:


• A low FSH level indicates pituitary or hypothalamic failure
• A high FSH level denotes primary gonadal failure or testicular cause
• A normal FSH level could be due to either non-obstructive or obstructive azoospermia. A testicular biopsy is usually required in such people to provide a definitive diagnosis.",,A,6035-3786.PNG

b)15o mcg
c)2oo mcg
d)1oo mcg","1oo mcg of carbetocin is used in the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH).
The use of carbetocin (1oo μg, IM/IV) is recommended for the prevention of PPH. It is a
long-acting synthetic analog of oxytocin with agonist properties. It binds to oxytocin receptors in the uterine smooth muscle, and results in rhythmic contractions, increased frequency of existing contractions, and increased uterine tone.
To effectively prevent PPH, the WHo recommends the use of only one of the following uterotonic agents:
• oxytocin - (1o IU - IM/IV)
• carbetocin - (1oo μg - IM/IV)
• Misoprostol - (4oo μg or 6oo μg, per-oral)
• Ergometrine/methylergometrine - (2oo μg - IM/IV)
• oxytocin and ergometrine fixed-dose combination - (5 IU,5ooμg - IM)

Q32,Milk production in pregnancy is inhibited by :,"a)Low luteinizing hormone
b)High estrogen
c)Human somatomammotropin
d)Low thyroid-stimulating hormone","Milk production in pregnancy is inhibited by high estrogen.
The synthesis and secretion of milk from the breast alveoli is known as lactogenesis. Prolactin, an anterior pituitary hormone, is responsible for lactogenesis. In spite of high prolactin levels during pregnancy, there is inhibition of milk secretion. This is because of high levels of estrogen and
progesterone circulating during pregnancy, which makes the breast tissues unresponsive to prolactin.
Following delivery, there is a fall in estrogen and progesterone levels. As a result, prolactin begins its milk secretory activity in previously fully developed mammary glands.
other hormones involved in lactogenesis:
• Insulin
• Growth hormone
• cortisol
• Thyroxine
• Placental lactogen aka human chorionic somatomammotropin: Has growth promoting and lactogenic effects

tubectomy in woman and vasectomy in man. These methods are advised for those couples, who have completed their families and do not want to bear the inconvenience or cost of the other
methods of contraception, and when the other methods are contraindicated.
• postpartum sterilization is performed in the first week of the postnatal period. It can be combined with a cesarean section
• Interval sterilization is done in non-pregnant women or at any time after 6 weeks of delivery. Tubal sterilization can be achieved by three methods which are:
• Electrocoagulation is used for the destruction of a segment of the tube
• Mechanical occlusion of the tube using a silicone rubber band (Falope ring) or a spring-loaded clip (Hulka clemens clip)
• suture ligation with or without tubal segment excision such as pomeroy's method, uchida's method, Irving's method, etc.

Asherman syndrome is the presence of uterine synechiae, due to the destruction of the
endometrium. It can occur as a result of trauma to the endometrium following vigorous
curettages such as incomplete abortion, postpartum hemorrhage, and elective abortion. Damage may also result from other uterine surgery such as metroplasty, myomectomy.
They usually present with menstrual abnormalities, infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss due to
inadequate placentation. Menstrual abnormalities, including hypomenorrhea and amenorrhea,
remain the most common clinical features associated with Asherman syndrome. Dysmenorrhea is occasionally present.
The diagnosis is confirmed with hysterosalpingography.
Management includes hysteroscopy, which enables adhesiolysis. Recurrence of adhesions is
prevented by insertion of IUCD for 3 months and giving estrogen cyclically (21 days) for 3 months to develop endometrium.
Note:
Amenorrhea indicates the complete absence of menstruation.
oligomenorrhoea is the term used to describe infrequent and irregular menses. In this condition, the cycle length is prolonged without affecting the duration and amount of flow.
Hypomenorrhoea refers to the condition in which the cycle length remains unaltered, however the duration of bleeding or the amount of blood loss, or both are substantially reduced.
Menorrhagia denotes excessive blood loss (increase in the duration and /or amount of bleeding) without any change in the cycle length.
Dysmenorrhoea is defined as cramping pain accompanying menstruation.",,B,
Q37,A teenage girl presented with irregular cycles and increased facial hair. Her ovaries showed increased volume. which of the following are used in the first line treatment?,"a)1,2,3
b)2,3,4
c)1,3,4
d)1,2,4","This patient's irregular menstrual cycles, increased facial hair (signifying clinical
hyperandrogenism), and increased ovarian volume are suggestive of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCos). Anti-androgens, lifestyle modifications, and combined oral contraceptives (2, 3, and 4)    constitue first-line treatment modalities for this condition. Laparoscopic drilling is a surgical
procedure done when medical therapy fails.
PCos is an endocrinopathy seen in women of reproductive age, affecting multiple
systems. Rotterdam criteria is used to diagnose PCoD. The presence oftwo of the three
components of this criteria establishes the diagnosis:
• oligo/amenorrhoea, anovulation, infertility
• Hirsutism/acne



• ultrasound findings:
• Enlarged ovaries with ovarian volume will be more than 1o mm3
• 12 or more small follicles each of 2-9 mm in size placed peripherally
ultrasound image given below shows an enlarged ovary seen in Pcos with multiple follicles in the periphery.


Treatment of PcoD:
• weight reduction alone is beneficial in mild hirsutism.
• Lifestyle changes, such as smoking cessation, are recommended.
• Fourth-generation oral contraceptive pills (ocP) containing ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone are used for treating menstrual abnormalities, reducing acne, and hirsutism.
• ocP with cyproterone acetate is prescribed for Pcos patients with hirsutism.
• Patients with PcoD are prone to developing insulin resistance, which can be controlled with metformin. Acarbosecan be used as an alternative if metformin is contraindicated.
• Infertility in PcoD patients is treated with clomiphene as the first-line drug for inducing
ovulation. Dexamethasone is used in combination to improve fertility rates. Letrozole is used off-label in clomiphene-resistant cases.
surgical options include laparoscopic ovarian drilling or puncture of not more than four cysts in  each ovary. This is done either by laser or by unipolar electrocautery. It restores endocrine levels and improves fertility. surgery is indicated only if:
• Medical therapy fails
• Hyperstimulation occurs
• Infertile women
• Previous pregnancy losses",,B,6040-3788.PNG
Q38,Identify the instrument given below.,"a)cusco’s speculum
b)sims' speculum
c)proctoscope
d)Doyen's retractor","The instrument shown in the image is Cusco’s speculum.
Cusco’s speculum is a self-retaining bivalve speculum used for visualisation of the cervix, vaginal fornices and for performing pap smear.


other options:
option B: sims' speculum is used for the assessment of rectocele and cystocele. The speculum is applied against the vaginal wall and slowly retracted out until a bulge appears, indicating
cystocele or rectocele.  It can also be used for visualization of the vaginal walls.


option C: A surgeon uses a lubricated proctoscope to visualize lesions in the anus, anorectal    junction, and lower rectum. It is done as an oPD procedure to detect hemorrhoids, polyps, or ulcers.





option D: Doyen's retractor is used to retract the abdominal wall as well as the bladder to
facilitate better exposure of the lower uterine segment during cesarian operation. It is also used to pull back the soft tissues to widen the surgical field during laparotomy.",5994-3753.PNG,A,6041-3790.PNG;6041-3789.PNG;6042-3792.PNG;6042-3791.PNG
Q39,"A 17-year-old girl was brought by her mother to the outpatient department with primary
amenorrhea. she had normal breast development and pubic hair. on examination, the vagina was blind-ending and the uterus was not palpable. what is the most probable diagnosis?","a)Mullerian agenesis
b)Gonadal dysgenesis
c)Turner syndrome
d)Testicular feminization syndrome","The given clinical scenario of a girl with primary amenorrhea, normal breasts, and pubic hair, with a blind-ending vagina and uterus not palpable, is suggestive of Mullerian agenesis.
Absent uterus and vagina in a person with female genotype and phenotype are features of Mullerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-kuster-Hauser syndrome.
ovaries are normal and secondary sexual characters are well developed with normal external
genitalia. This condition is associated with anomalies of the spine/skeleton and the kidneys along



with the urinary tract.
Diagnosis is made with the help of pelvic sonography, MRI, and laparoscopy. patients may have   rudimentary Mullerian bulbs without an endometrial cavity. These should be surgically excised if they are symptomatic.
other options:
option B: Gonadal dysgenesis patients present with primary amenorrhoea, absence of secondary sex characters (poorly developed breasts), and female external genitalia.
option C: In Turner syndrome, short stature with poor development of secondary sexual
characters and short stature will be seen. It has a karyotype of 45 Xo. Barr body will be absent. Female genital organs (vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries) are present. The ovaries, though present, are atrophic.
option D: Testicular feminization syndrome also known as androgen insensitivity syndrome has a karyotype of 46Xy. secondary sexual characters like the development of axillary hair and pubic
hair are absent in these females. However, breast development is adequate due to the conversion of androgen into estrogen during puberty.",,A,
Q40,A 24-year-old female presents with complaints of foul-smelling vaginal discharge. wet smear of the discharge is shown below. Drug of choice to treat this condition is_____,"a)clindamycin
b)Metronidazole
c)cotrimoxazole
d)Azithromycin","A female patient presenting with foul-smelling vaginal discharge and a wet smear showing clue cells points to a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, and the drug of choice is metronidazole.
Bacterial vaginosis is a polymicrobial infection caused by Mobiluncus curtisii, Gardnerella
vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, and Haemophilus vaginalis. It has a foul-smelling (fishy smell) vaginal discharge with minimal vulval irritation.
Amsel's criteria is helpful in diagnosing bacterial vaginosis when 3 of the following 4 are present:
• Thin, white homogenous vaginal discharge
• A pH of vaginal fluid &gt;4.5
• Fishy odor of discharge accentuated by adding 1o% KoH-whiff test
• presence of clue cells on microscopy: Clue cells are epithelial cells with a fuzzy border or granular cytoplasm caused by small gram-negative bacilli adhering to their surface
Treatment is oral metronidazole 5oo mg BD for 7 days.

Endodermal sinus tumor/yolk sac tumor is a type of ovarian germ cell tumor that is seen in premenarchal girls. schiller-Duval bodies are pathognomonic on
histopathology. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is commonly produced by this tumor and is used as a tumor marker.
Dysgerminona is a type of germ cell tumor and it corresponds to the seminoma of the testis. It  does not secrete either male or female sex hormones. It secretes placental alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and β-hCG. serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is
usually used in monitoring individuals or disease recurrence.
Choriocarcinoma is a type of mixed germ cell tumor. It is highly vascular. Histologically, the     tumor shows syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts. It secretes large quantities of human  chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone, which is used as a tumor marker in the diagnosis and management of the tumor.
Malignant epithelial cell tumors of the ovary secrete CA-125. It is a glycoprotein and surface cell antigen which is secreted by malignant epithelial tumors of the ovary. A level of more than 35
U/mL suggests a malignant and residual tumor and indicates the need for chemotherapy. CA-125 is also raised in abdominal tuberculosis and endometriosis.

Q42,which of the following modalities are used for the diagnosis of placenta accreta?,"a)1 and 3 only
b)1 and 2 only
c)2 and 3 only
d)1 and 4 only","Among the given options, ultrasonography and MRI can be used in the diagnosis of placenta accreta.
The term placenta accreta spectrum (pAS)/morbidly adherent placenta refers to abnormal
placental implantation characterized by the abnormally implanted, invasive, or adhered
placenta. This is due to the absence of decidua basalis and poor development of the fibrinoid or Nitabuch layer.
Risk factors include prior cesarian delivery, prior uterine surgery, prior curettage, and
endometrial ablation, associated placenta previa.
Types of the morbidly adherent placenta:
• placenta accreta: villi are attached to the myometrium.
• placenta increta: villi invade the myometrium.
• placenta percreta: villi penetrate through the myometrium and to or through the serosa.
ultrasound imaging, color Doppler, and MRI have all been useful in the diagnosis of morbidly adherent placenta during pregnancy.
uSG findings that suggest pAS are (1) placental lacunae, (2) thinning of the retroplacental
myometrium, (3) disruption of the bladder-uterine serosal interface, (4) bridging vessels from the placenta to the bladder-serosal interface, and (5) a placental bulge that pushes outward and
distorts the contour of the uterus.
color flow Doppler study shows hypervascularity of serosa bladder interface.
MRI reveals uterine bulging and dark intraplacental bands on T2-weighted imaging.
Management:
• partial placenta accreta: placental tissue is removed as much as possible. oxytocin helps in uterine contraction and hemostasis. In cases following cesarean delivery, bleeding areas are  oversewed.
• Total placenta accreta:
• parous women- hysterectomy is done
• If the patient desires to have a child- conservative measures include incising the uterus above the placental attachment, clamping, and cutting the umbilical cord as close to its base as possible. The placenta is left behind, which may get autolyzed eventually. uterine artery embolization or
therapy with methotrexate has also been done for the conservation of the uterus.
• If placenta accreta invades the bladder, placental removal alone is avoided. It requires a hysterectomy and partial cystectomy.
