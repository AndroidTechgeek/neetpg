Q1,A 62-year-old presented with diminished vision 1 year after cataract surgery. The findings are shown below. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)After cataract
b)Irvine-Gass syndrome
c)End ophthalmitis
d)uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome","Diminished vision 1 year after cataract surgery, supported with the image of vacoulated clusters seen behind IOL is suggestive of Elschnig’s pearls. It is a type of after cataract.
After cataract, or secondary cataract or posterior capsular opacification, is a late postoperative complication that follows extracapsular extraction of the lens. It is the most common late
postoperative complication. It may be caused by residual opaque lens matter or proliferation of left out anterior epithelial cells. Different types of after cataract include:
• Elschnig’s pearls: The subcapsular epithelial cells proliferate and develop into vacuolated soap bubble like clusters along the posterior capsule.
• soemmering’s ring: A peripheral dense ring is formed behind the iris and is enclosed between layers of the capsule.
• Dense membranous after-cataract: It is formed in the pupillary area impairing the vision.
• Thin membranous after-cataract: It is thickened posterior capsule.





Treatment of after cataract is by Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy of the posterior capsule, which works on the principle of photodisruption, or surgical posterior capsulotomy.
option B: Irvine–Gass syndrome is cystoid macular edema (CME) that develops in post-cataract    surgery patients. Though it is mostly clinically insignificant, some cases can present with blurring of vision, one to three months after surgery. In CME, on fundoscopy a honeycomb appearance
and on fundus fluorescein angiography(FFA) flower petal pattern can be seen. The below image depicts the flower petal pattern seen on FFA.


option C: post operative endophthalmitis presents as ocular pain, diminished vision and
hypopyon within months to years after the surgery. Fungal endophthalmitis can rarely occur with puff ball exudates in the vitreous cavity.
option D: UGH syndrome is where uveitis, glaucoma and hyphema occurs simultaneously. It is seen commonly with rigid anterior chamber intraocular lens (IoL) implantation.",2904-1741.PNG,A,2912-1750.PNG;2912-1749.PNG
Q2,Defect at the level of the optic chiasma will result in which of the following visual field defects?,"a)central scotoma
b)Bilateral hemianopia
c)Binasal hemianopia
d)Bitemporal hemianopia","Lesions at the level of the optic chiasma cause bitemporal hemianopia.
The Nasal fibers of each retina decussate at the optic chiasma. Hence, a lesion at this level affects the temporal quadrants of both eyes.
The optic chiasma lies directly above the tuberculum and diaphragma sellae &amp; is affected in
• Pituitary adenoma
• craniopharyngioma
• Meningioma
• Gliomas
• Multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis
option A: central scotoma is seen in lesions affecting the optic disc (intraocular part of optic     nerve) such as ethambutol toxic neuropathy, macular degeneration and lesions of visual cortex with bilateral homonymous macular defects.
option c: Binasal hemianopia is seen in lesions affecting bilateral lateral chiasma where the     temporal fibers of both the retina continue forward without crossing. This affects vision in the nasal quadrants of both eyes.",,D,
Q3,A 6o-year-old diabetic male presents with a history of decreased vision. Fluorescein angiography showed the following image. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy
b)severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy
c)Bird shot choroidopathy
d)proliferative diabetic retinopathy","The given clinical vignette and Fluorescein angiography findings of neovascularization are suggestive of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).
Neovascularization is a hallmark of PDR. So this rules out Non-proliferative diabetic
retinopathy-NPDR (option A,B).
option c: Birdshot retinochoroidopathy is an idiopathic bilateral chorioretinitis characterized by creamy yellow spots of chorioretinal hypopigmentation resembling a birdshot scatter. It most
commonly affects middle aged females who are HLA-A29 positive.
PDR is most common in patients with Type ■ diabetes after a period of 15-2o years and is
characterized by proliferation of new vessels at the optic disc (NVD) or elsewhere in the fundus (NVE).
( NVD- neovascularization at the optic disc ; NVE-neovascularization elsewhere in the fundus )    complications of PDR include recurrent vitreous hemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment and pre retinal hemorrhages.
It is treated by administration of Anti-VEGF drugs followed by pan retinal photocoagulation
which destroys the hypoxic retina that has been producing the vasoformative factors responsible for neovascularization.
Duration of diabetes mellitus is the most important factor for the development of diabetic retinopathy.
ophthalmoscopic features of NPDR include:



• Microaneurysms: due to loss of pericytes around the capillaries
• Retinal hemorrhages: both superficial (flame shaped) and deep (dot &amp; blot) hemorrhages.
• Hard exudates: composed of lipoproteins and lipid laden macrophages. They are yellow waxy looking and arranged in clumps or circinate patterns.
• cotton wool spots: which are small whitish fluffy lesions which represent areas of nerve infarct.
• Intra retinal microvascular abnormalities(IRMA): are arteriovenous shunts in retina
• venous abnormalities such as beading,looping and dilatation.


The below given image is that of Hard Exudates.",2905-1743.PNG,D,2914-1752.PNG;2914-1751.PNG
Q4,what is the most probable diagnosis based on the given image?,"a)3rd cranial palsy
b)6th nerve palsy
c)Bell's palsy
d)Horner's syndrome","The given image depicts restricted lateral movement of the left eye when the person is in left    lateral gaze. This is suggestive of left lateral rectus muscle paralysis due to isolated 6th cranial nerve palsy.
Isolated abducens(6th cranial) nerve palsy presents with esotropia / convergent squint in primary position with limitation of abduction on the side of the lesion.
This is due to unopposed action of the medial rectus muscle in the affected eye. There is also a compensatory head turn towards the side of the lesion to reduce the symptom of diplopia. The adduction is normal in 6th nerve palsy.
The various causes of 6th nerve palsy includes:
• Raised intracranial pressure
• Nasopharyngeal tumors
• Gradenigo syndrome as seen in mastoiditis or acute petrositis
• Basal skull fracture


option A: 3rd cranial nerve palsy presents with
• ptosis due to weakness of levator palpebrae superioris muscle(LPS)
• Abduction and depression in the primary position(down and out) due to unopposed action of the lateral rectus(6th nerve supply) and superior oblique muscles(4th nerve supply)
• Dilated pupil and defective accommodation due to parasympathetic palsy(involvement of Edinger westphal parasympathetic supply)
• Limited adduction, elevation due to ipsilateral paralysis of medial rectus, inferior oblique and inferior rectus .





option D: Bell’s palsy is an acute onset, idiopathic lower motor neuron lesion of the facial nerve which involves the ipsilateral upper and lower halves of the face.
It presents with an inability to close the eye and any attempts to close the eye results in the eye
turning upwards and outwards which is known as the Bell’s phenomenon. other features of Bell's palsy include drooling of saliva, deviation of angle of the mouth and facial asymmetry.
Additionally there may be noise intolerance and a loss of taste sensation.
The following image shows a patient with Bell’s palsy:


option D: Horner syndrome, also called oculosympathetic paresis, is produced by a lesion
anywhere along the sympathetic pathway supplying the head, neck and eyes. It is characterized by the classical triad of ptosis, miosis and anhidrosis(reduced ipsilateral sweating). other features
include mild enophthalmos, hypochromic heterochromia and anisocoria that is accentuated in dim light.
Tests for confirmation of Horner's syndrome -



• cocaine drops (2-4%)
Horner pupil does not dilate
Normal pupil dilates
• Apraclonidine drops (o.5-1%)
Horner pupil dilates - due to upregulation of α1 receptors in the dilator pupillae.
Normal pupil does not dilate",2905-1742.PNG,B,2915-1753.PNG;2916-1755.PNG;2916-1754.PNG
Q5,"A patient presents with endophthalmitis 5 days after cataract surgery. All of the following treatments can be used, except _____.","a)Intravitreal antibiotic injection
b)Intravenous steroids
c)pars plana vitrectomy
d)Topical antibiotics","Intravenous steroids are not used for the treatment of endophthalmitis.
Endophthalmitis is defined as an intraocular inflammation that predominantly affects the inner spaces of the eye and their contents, i.e. the vitreous and/or the anterior chamber. The cardinal  features of endophthalmitis are pain, swelling of the lid and diminished vision. once the
endophthalmitis sets in it is important to treat all the cases empirically with a combination of antibiotics and steroids from the beginning.
steroids are given in endophthalmitis to reduce the inflammation of the tissues. The preferred route of administration is either by intravitreal injections, topical concentrations or oral route. Intravenous route of administration of steroids is not used in endophthalmitis.
Acute postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis occurs within 1-7 days after cataract surgery and the most important factor to prevent it is preoperative administration of 5% povidone iodine.
The various drugs,routes and surgical management used to treat endophthalmitis are as follows:
• The mainstay of treatment is intravitreal injections of antibiotics.
First choice: vancomycin 1 mg in o.1 mL plus ceftazidime 2.25mg in o.1ml.
second choice: vancomycin 1 mg in o.1 mL plus amikacin o.4mg in o.1ml.
If there is no improvement, a repeat intravitreal injection should be given after 48 hours
• Topical solutions of antibiotics are started immediately and used frequently
vancomycin (5omg/ml) or cefazolin (5omg/ml)
Amikacin (2omg/ml) or tobramycin
• systemic antibiotics have a limited role in the treatment but are commonly used in practice.
• steroid therapy includes
Intravitreal injection of Dexamethasone(o.4mg in o.1ml) which is started along with antibiotics.
Topical Dexamethasone (o.1%)
oral steroids such as prednisolone are started after 24 hours of intensive antibiotic therapy.
• supportive therapy are



cycloplegics such as Atropine 1%
Anti-Glaucoma drugs such as oral acetazolamide or timolol in patients with raised intraocular pressure
• vitrectomy- pars plana vitrectomy is done if the patient does not improve with the above
therapy in 48-72 hours or when the visual acuity is reduced to hand movements near the eye.",,B,2918-1756.PNG
Q6,Identify the refractive error.,"a)Myopia
b)presbyopia
c)Hypermetropia
d)Astigmatism","In the above image, parallel rays are focused in front of the retina and hence the refractive error shown is Myopia.
Myopia, also known as short sightedness, is that dioptric condition of the eye in which, with the  accommodation at rest, incident parallel rays come to a focus anterior to the light-sensitive layer of the retina. In myopia the defect in vision is more for objects present at a distance.
American Optometric Association (AOA) Grading of Myopia:
• Low myopia, when the error is ≤ –3D.
• Moderate myopia, when the error is between -3D to -6D.
• High myopia, when the error is ≥ –6D.





option B: presbyopia is used to define physiological insufficiency of accommodation that causes   progressive loss of near vision. It is commonly seen in elderly due to age-related decline in ciliary muscle power. Bifocals spectacles are prescribed in presbyopia.
option C: In hypermetropia, parallel rays of light are focussed behind the retina causing defective vision which is more for near objects.
option D: In astigmatism, the rays of light entering the eye fail to converge at a point focus but
they form focal lines. strum’s connoid of astigmatism represents the configuration of a bundle of  light rays formed by a regularly astigmatic(toric) surface and helps in understanding the optics of regular astigmatism.",2906-1744.PNG,A,2919-1758.PNG;2919-1757.PNG
Q7,what is the diagnosis of the condition seen in the image?,"a)pinguecula
b)pterygium
c)chemical burn
d)Thermal burn","The above image depicting a wing shaped encroachment of conjunctiva onto the cornea is suggestive of pterygium.
pterygium is a triangular fibrovascular ingrowth that is seen following an elastotic degeneration of the subconjunctival tissue. The apex of the pterygium lies towards the cornea. The pterygium is
usually seen on the nasal side in the palpable aperture and can give rise to symptoms such as
foreign body sensation in the eye, diplopia and defective vision due to corneal astigmatism. In
some cases, iron deposition can be seen in the corneal epithelium anterior to the advancing head of the pterygium known as the stocker’s line.
pterygium can be left untreated if there is no visual impairment. In cases with impaired vision, procedures such as surgical excision with free conjunctival limbal graft &amp; surgical excision with amniotic membrane graft and mitomycin-c can be done.
option A: pinguecula is an asymptomatic yellow-white mound of degenerated collagen fibers of
the conjunctival stroma. It more commonly starts on the nasal limbus and can later be seen on the temporal side. The apex of the pinguecula is directed away from the cornea. It is mostly a
stationary condition, so no treatment is usually required. If inflamed, topical steroids can be applied.


option c: chemical burns are caused by alkalis and acids. In mild-moderate burns, the end result is corneal ulceration followed by opacification. severe burns result in sloughing of the whole
cornea followed by staphyloma formation. complications of chemical burns include symblepharon where the palpebral &amp; bulbar conjunctiva are fused.
option D: Thermal burns from fire &amp; hot fluids mainly affect the lids. cornea &amp; conjunctiva will be affected in severe cases.",2907-1745.PNG,B,2920-1759.PNG
Q8,A patient with glaucoma presents with a bulging cornea. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)keratoconus
b)keratomalacia
c)staphyloma
d)Granular dystrophy","High intraocular pressure leads to the thinning of the outer tunics of the eyeball such as cornea and sclera, thereby resulting in their ectasia (bulging) which is known as



staphyloma. ciliary and equatorial staphylomas are most commonly associated with glaucoma.
staphyloma is an abnormal protrusion of the uveal tissue through a weak and thin portion of the cornea or sclera. so, staphyloma is lined internally by uveal tissue and externally by weak cornea or sclera.
Types of staphyloma:

Types	pathology	causes

keratoconus (option A) is a progressive bilateral corneal ectatic disorder due to defective
synthesis of mucopolysaccharide and collagen tissue. It usually starts at puberty and progresses slowly, not associated with risk factors like glaucoma. Therefore, we can rule out keratoconus in



this patient.",,C,2921-1760.PNG
Q9,"A patient presents with unilateral ptosis with hypotropia in the same eye. He was given an IV injection, following which the symptoms go away. which of the following is the most likely
diagnosis?","a)Myasthenia gravis
b)6th nerve palsy
c)3rd nerve palsy
d)Horner syndrome","only Myasthenia gravis among the conditions mentioned above, would show dramatic
improvement after administration of an IV injection like Anti-cholinesterase, edrophonium.
Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by generalized muscle weakness and rapidly progressing fatigue that improves after short periods of rest. ocular myasthenia gravis causes progressive external ophthalmoplegia which affects only the extraocular muscles. Early
ocular manifestations include failure of convergence &amp; ptosis which is mostly bilateral and increases on prolonged fixation or attempts to look upwards. In the initial phase, there can be   unilateral myogenic ptosis, which improves after short rest rapidly.
Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis can be made by performing the tensilon test where the symptoms improve for a short period on administering a short acting Anticholinesterase drug such as
edrophonium.
Note:
single most sensitive test for Myasthenia Gravis - single fiber Electromyography
The single most specific test for Myasthenia Gravis - AchR antibodies
option B: 6th nerve palsy- isolated 6th nerve palsy presents with convergent squint with limitation of abduction in the affected eye, due to the lateral rectus muscle palsy.


option A: 3rd cranial nerve palsy presents with
• ptosis due to weakness of levator palpebrae superioris muscle(LPs)
• Abduction and depression in the primary position(down and out) due to unopposed action of the lateral rectus(6th nerve supply) and superior oblique muscles(4th nerve supply)

Q10,which is the most common lacrimal gland tumor?,"a)Adenoid cystic carcinoma
b)pleomorphic adenoma
c)Mucoepidermoid carcinoma
d)Malignant mixed tumor","pleomorphic adenoma is the most common lacrimal gland tumor. It is also the most common epithelial tumor of the lacrimal gland.
pleomorphic adenoma, or benign mixed tumor, presents commonly in middle age as a slowly    progressive painless swelling in the upper outer quadrant of the eyelid. The bone is usually not invaded in these tumors. They are treated by surgical removal along with their intact
pseudo-capsule.



Malignant tumors of the lacrimal gland such as adenoid cystic carcinoma (option A),
mucoepidermoid carcinoma (option C) and malignant mixed tumor (option D) generally occur in the elderly with a short history of appearance, rapid progression and pain. These tumors also
present in the upper eyelid and are known to invade the adjacent bones. Radical surgical
procedures and high dose radiotherapy are necessary for the removal of the tumor. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is the most common malignant epithelial tumor of the lacrimal gland.
Both malignant and benign tumors are known to push the eyeball downwards and inwards while restricting the upwards and outwards movement of the eyeball.
The most common epithelial tumors, in order of frequency, are as follows:
• Benign mixed tumor (BMT), also known as a pleomorphic adenoma (pA)
• Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC)
• pleomorphic adenocarcinoma (ACA)
• Mucoepidermoid carcinoma",,B,
Q11,A patient recently underwent LASIK surgery for his myopia. He is now complaining of headaches and eye pain. Identify the test being performed on him.,"a)pachymetry
b)Tonometry
c)Auto Refractometery
d)A Scan","The above image is of the dynamic contour tonometer such as the pascal tonometer. The dynamic contour tonometer(pascal) offers a non-invasive and direct method of intraocular pressure (Iop)   measurement with an additional measurement of the ocular pulse amplitude. This type of
tonometer is unaffected by the corneal thickness and it is the tonometer of choice in post-Lasik patients.
option A: pachymetry is used to measure the corneal thickness.
The below image is of pachymetry.


option C: Auto Refractotemetry is a computerized refractometer that is used to find out the error of refraction. This gives rapid information about the kind of refractive error in terms of sphere,    cylinder with axis and inter pupillary distance.



option D: A-scan ultrasonography is a useful diagnostic tool for intraocular evaluation especially in the setting of opaque media. The report of the A scan is displayed as a unidimensional display of spikes along a baseline where the distance between the spikes gives the indirect measurement  of the tissues. A-scan is used to measure
• The axial length of the eyeball for Intraocular lens (IoL) power calculation
• Anterior chamber depth
• Thickness of intraocular mass.
A-scan ultrasonography is shown in the image below.",2908-1746.PNG,B,2924-1763.PNG;2925-1764.PNG
Q12,"A patient presents to the emergency department and is found to have a corneal abrasion,  corneal ulcer, corneal perforation, and foreign body. which of the following will not cause hypotonic maculopathy in this patient?","a)suprachoroidal haemorrhage
b)cyclodialysis of uvea
c)corneal perforation
d)Filtration site leak","suprachoroidal hemorrhage will not cause hypotonic maculopathy in this patient.
Maculopathy is common in eyes developing hypotony, which is defined as Iop &lt;6 mmHg. The   most common cause is excessive drainage following glaucoma filtration surgery (option D). other causes include trauma such as cyclodialysis of the uvea (option B), penetrating injury (option C),  chronic uveitis, retinal detachment, and other systemic causes such as dehydration, uncontrolled   diabetes, uremia, and treatment with hyperosmotic agents. They usually cause bilateral hypotonic maculopathy.
suprachoroidal hemorrhage is a bleed into the suprachoroidal space that results from the rupture of the posterior ciliary artery. when the bleed is severe it causes extrusion of intraocular contents that is termed as expulsive hemorrhage. It is a rare but dreaded complication of the
phacoemulsification procedure. signs seen in suprachoroidal hemorrhage are:
• progressive increase in intraocular pressure
• prolapse of iris
• Loss or partial obscuration of the red reflex



• In severe cases there can be extrusion of the posterior segment contents into the anterior chamber and through the incision such as vitreous extrusion
Immediate treatment involves rapid closure of the incision followed by administration of
IoP-lowering medications such as oral acetazolamide and topical or systemic steroids to reduce inflammation. standard post-operative antibiotics can be added in these patients.",,A,
Q13,Name the location of the nucleus supplying the muscle marked by the arrow in the image given below.,"a)superior olivary
b)Inferior colliculus
c)superior colliculus
d)Facial colliculus","The muscle marked is the medial rectus. The medial rectus is supplied by the oculomotor nerve, the nucleus of which is situated at the level of the superior colliculus in the posterior midbrain.   The oculomotor (3rd cranial) nerve nucleus consists of
• single central nuclei for the levator palpebrae muscle of both the eyes
• Bilateral subnuclei with crossed projections supplying the contralateral superior rectus
• Bilateral subnuclei with uncrossed projections supplying the ipsilateral inferior rectus, inferior oblique, medial rectus in the dorso-ventral order.
• Bilateral subnuclei known as the Edinger-westphal nucleus which provides parasympathetic input to the ciliary body and the iris sphincter.
option A: superior olivary nucleus is an important relay station in the auditory pathway, it is responsible for detection of direction and localization of sound.
option B: Inferior colliculus- The trochlear(4th cranial) nerve nucleus lies in the midbrain at the level of the inferior colliculus. The trochlear nerves leave the midbrain from its posterior surface and decussate before supplying the contralateral superior oblique muscle of the eyeball.
option D: Facial colliculus- the facial colliculus is located in the cranial part of the pons. It is
produced by the facial nerve(7th cranial nerve) winding around the nucleus of the abducens nerve (6th cranial nerve).",2909-1747.PNG,C,
Q14,silent choroid on FFA is a feature of which of the following disorders?,"a)stargardt's disease
b)Best's disease
c)Age related macular degeneration
d)cystoid macular edema","silent/Dark choroid on FFA is a feature of stargardt's disease. The classic feature of 'silent choroid' is due to the masking of background choroidal fluorescence by lipofuscin deposits in the
subretinal space.
stargardt disease constitutes the most common type of macular dystrophy. It has mutations in a photoreceptor cell-specific ATP-binding cassette gene (ABC4) that is usually inherited in an
autosomal recessive manner. The disease usually starts in the juvenile group with progressive central vision loss and color vision loss that occurs due to the atrophy of the macular retinal    pigment epithelium with an accumulation of discrete pisciform flecks of lipofuscin.
signs of stargardt’s disease:
• Beaten bronze appearance of the macula that is caused by the atrophic changes in the RPE.
• silent/Dark choroid on FFA.



• visual field testing shows central vision loss.
• The electroretinogram (ERG) is normal early in the disease but may be reduced in more advanced cases.
Fundus flavimaculatus is genetically considered to be a part of the same spectrum as stargardt's disease with late onset i.e. usually after 4o years of age.


other options:
option B: Best's disease also known as vitelliform macular dystrophy is an autosomal dominant
macular dystrophy in which lipofuscin accumulates in the central macula, causing progressive
central vision loss. This disease is linked to mutations in the bestrophin (vMD2) gene and they do not exhibit silent choroid on FFA. Findings seen in Best’s disease are:
• vitelliform(yolk like) appearance of the fundus
• Relatively normal ERG results associated with abnormal EoG
The given below is the fundus picture of Best's disease showing an egg yolk lesion in the macula.






option C: Age related Macular degeneration(ARMD) also known as senile macular degeneration is a chronic and progressive bilateral degenerative disorder of the macula that affects older
individuals &gt;5o yrs. ARMD is classified as dry and wet ARMD where the hallmarks are the presence of drusen and choroidal neovascularization respectively. Drusen are extracellular
eosinophilic deposits between RPE and Bruch’s membrane.
Clinical features include loss of central vision, distorted vision (lines seen as wavy), and sudden     painless loss of vision as seen in wet ARMD. The image below shows Drusens in the macular area in dry macular degeneration.


option D: Cystoid Macular edema (CME) is a collection of fluid between the outer plexiform layer and the inner nuclear layer of the retina following a break in the blood-retinal barrier. In CME on fundoscopy, a honeycomb appearance and on FFA flower petal pattern can be seen. The below
image shows the flower petal pattern on FFA as seen in CME.",,A,2927-1766.PNG;2927-1765.PNG;2928-1768.PNG;2928-1767.PNG
Q15,The physician noticed the following finding in a patient that came to the OPD for an eye exam. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Entropion of right eye
b)Lagophthalmos of right eye
c)Ptosis of right eye
d)Exophthalmos of left eye","The given image of the patient shows ptosis of the right eye. Ptosis is abnormal drooping of the
upper eyelid to a level that covers more than 2mm of the superior cornea, it commonly occurs due to paralysis or defective development of the levator palpebrae superioris (LPS).
Types:
• congenital ptosis
• Acquired ptosis
• Neurogenic ptosis is caused by innervational defects such as third nerve palsy, Horner’s syndrome.
• Myogenic ptosis occurs due to acquired disorders ofthe LPS muscle or the myoneural junction- Myasthenia gravis.
• Aponeurotic ptosis develops due to defects of the levator aponeurosis.
• Mechanical ptosis may result from the excessive weight on the upper lid as seen in patients with lid tumors, multiple chalazia, and lid edema.
Treatment of ptosis:
• The Fasanella–Servat operation is indicated for cases of minimal ptosis of  1.5 –2 mm with good function of the levator and a good lid fold.
• In moderate-to-severe ptosis with a moderate levator action, levator resection can be carried out.
Note: Pseudoptosis is apparent but not true drooping of the eyelid. causes include lack of
support of the lids by the globe(orbital volume deficit like an artificial eye, microphthalmos, or enophthalmos), contralateral lid retraction, ipsilateral hypotropia or brow ptosis.
option A: Entropion is defined as inward rolling of the lid margin. The constant rubbing of the eyelashes onto the cornea can cause irritation, punctate corneal erosions and in severe cases
ulceration and pannus formation. weiss operation is done in senile entropion.
option B: Lagophthalmos- in lagophthalmos there is incomplete closure of the palpable aperture when the patient attempts to close the eyes due to congenital deformity, paralysis of the
orbicularis muscle, ectropion or contraction of the lid. Treatment includes the management of exposure keratopathy with frequent instillation of lubricants.





option D: Exophthalmos- Although exophthalmos and proptosis are used interchangeably, the term exophthalmos is used to describe the protrusion/prominence of the eyes due to thyroid     diseases while proptosis can be due to any other causes. Most common causes of proptosis:

unilateral proptosis	Bilateral proptosis
In children: orbital cellulitis	Neuroblastoma & leuke mia
In adults: Thyroid ophthalmo pathy	Thyroid opthalmopathy",2910-1748.PNG,C,2930-1769.PNG
