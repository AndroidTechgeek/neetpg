Q1,which of the following statements is false regarding acute radiation syndrome?,"a)Bone marrow suppression occurs earlier than neurovascular effects
b)GI manifestations occur at a lower radiation dose than neurovascular effects","GI manifestations do not occur at a lower radiation dose than bone marrow depression.
stages of Acute Radiation syndrome (ARs)
The prodromal phase manifests with non-specific symptoms like nausea, vomiting, anorexia.
Early and persistent symptoms predict severity.
Latent phase: The patient looks and feels generally healthy for a few hours or even up to a few weeks. In severe cases, this phase may be absent.
Manifest illness phase: symptoms are seen as per the radiation dose. Tissues with greater rates of cellular division are most radiosensitive, and hence the hematopoietic and gastrointestinal
systems are the most affected.
Recovery phase or Death: The recovery phase will be seen after the manifest stage when the
patient recovers from the acute exposure. The time taken for recovery will depend on the severity of the injury and the organ system affected.

Q2,A 46-year-old male presented with chronic back pain and neck stiffness. X-ray cervical spine is given below. what is the diagnosis?,"a)Ankylosing spondylitis
b)Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis
c)klippel feil syndrome
d)sprengel deformity","The given clinical scenario and the radiograph showing ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament, in front of the C2 to C7 cervical vertebral bodies, point towards a diagnosis of Diffuse Idiopathic skeletal Hyperostosis (DIsH). It is also referred to as Forestier disease.
DIsH is a common disorder characterized by bone and calcium formation at the sites of
ligamentous insertions. It occurs in the middle-aged or elderly. The radiograph shows calcification of anterior and sometimes posterior longitudinal ligaments appearing as flowing or dripping-like



candle wax. It is usually asymptomatic but the calcification might cause compression of the spinal cord and can be better visualized on CT and MRI. In contrast to ankylosing spondylitis, the
sacroiliac joints are usually spared.",3897-2450.PNG,B,
Q3,"An 18-year-old girl presented with seizures and her radiological image is as given below. knowing that the MR spectroscopy of the lesion showed elevated choline, alanine, and    lactate, what is the likely diagnosis?","a)cerebral toxoplasmosis
b)Neurocysticercosis
c)cryptococcosis
d)Multiple tuberculomas","The given radiological image and history of seizures suggests a diagnosis of neurocysticercosis.
Neurocysticercosis presents with seizures, hydrocephalus, raised ICP, and may even cause signs of chronic meningitis. The given image shows multilobulated cystic lesions (with scolex) in the
subarachnoid space, typical parenchymal brain calcifications are suggestive of neurocysticercosis caused by T. solium (Cysticercosis cellulose).
• Cyst with a dot sign: seen in both MRI and CT and the dot represents the eccentrically placed scolex of the parasite.
MR Spectroscopy features of neurocysticercosis include elevated lactate, alanine, succinate, and     choline levels and reduced levels of N -acetyl aspartate and creatine. Escobar's pathological stages describe 4 stages - vesicular, colloidal vesicular, granular nodular, and nodular calcified.
other options
• Solid or ring enhancement is typical in the post-contrast images of tuberculoma. A central focus of calcification with a ring of peripheral enhancement (the ""target sign"") is also described in
tuberculosis but is not specific to it.
• Cerebral toxoplasmosis appears as multiple hypodense regions predominantly in the basal
ganglia and at the corticomedullary junction. It can be associated with ring enhancing lesions as well.
• Cryptococcosis is usually associated with normal scans but may show cerebral atrophy, hydrocephalus or mass lesions as well.",3898-2451.PNG,B,
Q4,which of the following is a finding of large bowel obstruction?,"a)Dilated loops of intestine with plica circularis
b)Dilated loops with haustrations
c)string of pearls sign
d)central dilated bowel loops","Dilated bowel loops with haustrations is a feature of large bowel obstruction.
In large bowel obstruction, the colon is distended proximally with the distal portion collapsed.
The colon is considered dilated if it is more than 6 cm in diameter while the cut off for caecum is 9cm.
other options:
Dilated loops of the intestine with plica circularis (valvulae conniventes) and predominantly
central loops are features of the small bowel obstruction. The small bowel is considered dilated if it is more than 3 cm in diameter.
The string of pearls sign is also a feature of small bowel obstruction seen in plain radiographs or CT. It represents a row of gas bubbles trapped between the valvulae conniventes.
Differences in small and large bowel obstruction on radiography are listed below:




	small bowel	Large bo wel
valvulae connivente s	present in jejunu m	Absent
No of Loops	Many	Few
Distribution of loops	central	peripher al
Haustra	Absent	present
Diameter	3-5 cm	>5 cm",,B,
Q5,A 25-year-old male with Marfanoid features presented with sudden onset breathlessness. The chest X-ray is given below. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)pneumothorax
b)pleural effusion
c)Consolidation
d)Fibrosis","The chest X-ray demonstrating tracheal deviation and displacement of the heart away from the affected side along with the partial collapse of the left lung in the above condition points to a     diagnosis of left-sided pneumothorax.
Marfan's syndrome is one of the causes for seconday spontaneous pneumothorax in adults.


pneumothorax refers to the collection of air in the pleural space.
chest radiograph in spontaneous pneumothorax demonstrates:
• Thin, sharp white line, demarcating the visceral pleural edge
• Absence of lung markings seen peripheral to this line
• peripheral space radiolucent compared to adjacent lung
• complete lung collapse, as well as subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum, may be seen
• Deep sulcus sign (on supine chest radiograph)



Deep sulcus sign: on a supine position(common in the ICU), air collects anteriorly and basally,  within the non-dependent portions ofthe pleural space, abnormally deepening the costophrenic angle. This sign is indicative of pneumothorax in such patients and may be the only visible clue, especially when patient can not be imaged upright.
The image below is plain chest x-ray showing pneumothorax with deep sulcus sign (shown by arrow):


when there is a progressive accumulation of air intrapleurally in the thoracic cavity (caused by a  valve effect during inspiration and expiration), it is called Tension pneumothorax. It can result in compression of mediastinal structures and compromise cardiopulmonary function. It is
life-threatening and requires emergency intervention.",3899-2452.PNG,A,3902-2453.PNG;3903-2454.PNG
Q6,"A 22-year-old male was brought to the emergency room following a road traffic accident. on examination, his GCS was E2M2v3. He had no fractures and no hydrocephalus or raised
intracranial pressure. Non-contrast CT was performed and was found to be normal. The likely diagnosis is","a)Diffuse axonal injury
b)post concussion syndrome
c)Extra dural hemorrhage
d)Herniation of brain","The given clinical scenario of an RTA with no imaging abnormality along with a disproportionate clinical manifestation suggests diffuse axonal injury.
It is caused due to stretching of axons in subcortical white matter due to sudden deceleration
injuries. It is usually associated with mild nonspecific changes in NCCT. It is visualized on T2 MRI characterized by multiple lesions showing microbleeds or linear hypointensities. It may also show  disruption of white matter tracts on tractography.
other options
post-concussion syndrome usually follows mild traumatic brain injury. It does not have a severe clinical status as seen in this patient.
Extradural hemorrhage is produced usually results secondary to trauma to head. The bleeding is    usually arterial and blood collects between outer dura and inner table of the skull. It can very well be visualized on CT.
A cerebral herniation is defined as a shift of cerebral tissue in an adjacent space. Intracranial
brain herniation can be classified into 3 types - subfalcine, transtentorial and tonsillar. A distinct



clinical picture can be produced as a result of compression of neurovascular structures by the herniating part. CT is the imaging modality of choice because it can be done rapidly.",,A,
