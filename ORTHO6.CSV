Q1,A 4o-year-old patient presents to the emergency department following a road traffic accident. The radiograph of his pelvis is shown below. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)central dislocation of the hip
b)Fracture shaft of femur
c)posterior dislocation of the hip
d)Anterior dislocation of the hip","The radiograph of the patient's pelvis following a road traffic accident reveals upward and lateral dislocation of the left femoral head, accompanied by an obscured lesser trochanter, indicating a   posterior dislocation of the left hip.
posterior hip dislocation is commonly seen following dashboard injuries and the patient presents with flexion, adduction, and internal rotation deformity of the lower limb.
Radiological findings:
• Loss of continuity of acetabulum with the femoral head (break in shenton's line)
• upward and lateral displacement of the femoral head
• The femoral head appears smaller than normal
• The lesser trochanter is not visualized as the thigh is internally rotated
• Femoral head and posterior acetabular wall fractures may also be seen
The image below shows posterior dislocation with disruption of shenton's line:


Treatment:
An early reduction should be done as the risk of osteonecrosis and subsequent osteoarthritis increases with time.
closed reduction under sedation or general anaesthesia is done in most cases. If there is an
associated femoral neck fracture, a closed reduction should not be attempted as it can lead to the displacement of the femoral neck and disrupt the blood supply to the femoral head.
In closed reduction the following steps are done:
The pelvis is kept in a steady position and traction is applied in line of the femur with the knee    flexed at 9o degrees. The hip is then flexed maintaining the traction along with internal rotation and adduction. This is called Allis' maneuver. The below image describes this technique:





other methods of closed reduction include - stimson's maneuver, East Baltimore lift maneuver, and Bigelow's maneuver.
After reduction, the stability of the hip is tested by flexing the hip to 9o degrees, and a
longitudinal and posteriorly directed force is applied. while performing this the joint is monitored in an image intensifier to look for any signs of subluxation. In case of evidence of subluxation or     any significant fractures then surgical repair should be done. If there is a delay in surgical
correction, skeletal traction with a distal femoral traction pin can be done.
If there is damage to the acetabulum, or intervening structures between the femoral head and the acetabular surface are present - open reduction can be considered.
Early complications:
• sciatic nerve injury - It can be damaged in 1o-2o% of the cases
• vascular injury - superior gluteal artery tear can occur
• concurrent femoral shaft fracture - when both occur together hip dislocation may be missed Late complications:
• osteonecrosis of the femoral head
• Myositis ossificans
• secondary osteoarthritis
• Recurrent instability",5309-3359.PNG,C,5314-3364.PNG;5315-3365.PNG
Q2,A 12-year-old boy presents with swelling and pain for 6 months over the upper tibia. His radiographic image is shown below. The most likely diagnosis is:,"a)osteosarcoma
b)osteoclastoma
c)Brodie's abscess
d)Ewing's sarcoma","The given clinical scenario of a child with prolonged swelling and pain over the upper tibia, along with a radiograph showing a lytic lesion with a dense sclerotic rim and minimal periosteal
reaction, suggests the diagnosis of Brodie's abscess.



Brodie's abscess is a localized form of subacute osteomyelitis that occurs when organisms of low virulence infect an immunocompetent host. The abscess is walled off by the thickening of the
surrounding bone trabeculae. It most commonly involves the metaphysis ofthe proximal tibia and distal femur.
The patient is typically a child or adolescent experiencing prolonged pain near a large joint for several weeks or months. symptoms may include a limp, slight swelling, muscle wasting, and   localized tenderness.
The typical radiographic finding is a circumscribed, round or oval radiolucent cavity measuring
1-2 cm in diameter, surrounded by a halo of sclerosis, with minimal or no periosteal reaction. The radioisotope scan shows markedly increased activity. MRI may be helpful in diagnosis. open
biopsy with curettage is indicated if there is any doubt in the diagnosis.
Differential diagnoses include:
• cystic tuberculosis
• Eosinophilic granuloma
• osteoid osteoma
• Ewing's sarcoma Treatment:
• Immobilization and antibiotics (flucloxacillin and fusidic acid) intravenous for 4-5 days, followed by oral administration for another 6 weeks; healing may take up to 12 months
• curettage is needed if the x-rays show no healing after conservative management.
The following X-ray and MRI images show Brodie's abscess of the radius in a patient.






The differentiating features of each of the given conditions are as follows:

condition	Age group	Radiographic findings
Brodie's abscess	children, adolescents	Lytic lesion with dense sclero tic rim, minimal periosteal re action
osteosarcoma (option A)	Bimodal: children and adoles cents, 7o-8o yearsRapidly pr   ogressivetumor	periosteal reaction leading to sunray appearance and cod  man triangle
osteoclastoma (option B)	2o-4o years (unlikely in child ren)	Lytic lesion withthin sclerotic rim, minimal periosteal reac  tion
Ewing's sarcoma (option D)	1o-2o years	Diaphysealmass and perioste al reaction with onion-peel a  ppearance",5310-3360.PNG,C,5316-3366.PNG;5317-3367.PNG
Q3,which of the following fractures is most prone to non-union?,"a)proximal scaphoid
b)Inter-trochanteric
c)Distal radius
d)olecranon fracture","Among the given fractures, proximal scaphoid fractures are most prone to non-union.
since the nutrient artery enters the scaphoid near its distal end, proximal fractures are associated with avascular necrosis and non-union. The more proximal the fracture in the scaphoid, the
higher the chances of avascular necrosis and non-union.
certain bones have a relatively limited or watershed blood supply that can potentially get interrupted by fracture. These include:
• Head of the femur: after fracture of the neck or posterior dislocation of the hip.
• proximal scaphoid: due to fracture through the waist of the scaphoid.



• Lunate: following a dislocation.
• Body of talus: after fracture of its neck.
Fractures in these sites have a higher risk for non-union or development of osteonecrosis.
other options:
option B: Inter-trochanteric fractures involve either the greater or lesser trochanters or both,
more common in the elderly following a history of a fall. Malunion is the most frequent
complication. The vast metaphyseal region has an abundant blood supply, contributing to a higher union rate and fewer chances of avascular necrosis.
option c: Distal radius fractures occur by fall on an outstretched hand and they include colles' fracture (most common), smith's fracture, Barton's fracture, and chauffer's fracture. The
complications include joint stiffness, malunion (more common), carpal tunnel syndrome,
subluxation of the inferior radio-ulnar joint, sudeck's dystrophy, and rupture of the extensor pollicis longus tendon. Avascular necrosis or non-union is rare.
option D: olecranon fracture results from a direct injury as in a fall onto the point of the elbow. complications include non-union, elbow stiffness, and osteoarthritis.",,A,5318-3368.PNG
Q4,painful arc syndrome is seen in all except:,"a)complete tear of supraspinatus
b)Fracture greater tuberosity
c)subacromial bursitis
d)supraspinatus tendinitis","The partial tear of the supraspinatus tendon is responsible for painful arc syndrome rather than a complete tear.
painful arc syndrome, also known as impingement syndrome is a condition where there is pain in the shoulder and upper arm during the mid-range of shoulder abduction (between 6o-12o
degrees), arising due to repetitive rubbing of the supraspinatus tendon under the coracoacromial arch.
causes include:
• Minor tears of the supraspinatus tendon



• supraspinatus tendinitis
• calcification of supraspinatus tendon
• Fracture of greater tuberosity
• subacromial bursitis
Important tests for impingement are:
• painful arc test
• Hawkin-kennedy's test
• Neer's impingement sign
• Jobe's test
Investigations:
• An x-ray of the shoulder helps to detect bony avulsions, spurs, calcific deposits, sclerotic areas etc.
• ultrasound of the shoulder joint is highly reliable with a sensitivity of 98%.
• single contrast arthrogram is considered the gold standard in diagnosing rotator cuff tears Management:
• conservative: heat massage, exercises, NsAIDs, subacromial steroid injections, and temporary immobilization (9o% of patients recover with these measures).
• Indications for surgery include failure of conservative measures for 3 months, increasing loss of shoulder function, and patients who are young and active.
• surgical techniques include excision of adhesions and manipulation of the shoulder, excision of calcium deposits, repair of incomplete tear, acromioplasty,  acromionectomy for more disabling   pain with normal range of movements, direct suture for complete rupture of the rotator cuff,
rotation and transposition of the flap, and free graft.",,A,5319-3369.PNG;5320-3372.PNG;5320-3371.PNG;5320-3370.PNG
Q5,De-gloving injury refers to ______,"a)skin and subcutaneous fat are stripped from the underlying fascia
b)skin, subcutaneous fat and fascia are stripped from tendons
c)skin, subcutaneous fat, fascia and tendons are stripped from bone
d)only skin is stripped off","Degloving is the avulsion of skin and subcutaneous fat from the underlying fascia, muscle or bone.
Degloving injuries can be open or closed. An example of open degloving injury is finger avulsion injury with loss of skin. closed degloving injuries result from shearing forces (e.g. motor vehicle  collisions).
The extent of degloving injuries are often underappreciated and much of the skin may be
non-viable.  Disruption of perforating vascular and lymphatic vessels may result in a characteristic haemolymphatic collection between the fascial planes called a Morel-Lavallée lesion.
patterns of degloving injury:
• Limited degloving with abrasion or avulsion
• Non-circumferential degloving
• circumferential single plane degloving
• circumferential multiplanar degloving
Assessing the viability of degloved tissue can be difficult and may therefore require more than one surgical exploration and debridement before definitive reconstruction. Non-viable skin may show  fixed staining and thrombosis of subcutaneous veins. Most surgeons serially excise the degloved     skin until punctate dermal bleeding is seen from viable tissue.
Intravenous fluorescein can help in delineating non-viable tissue, but it requires specialist
equipment and there is a small risk of anaphylaxis. Indocyanine green has been found to have less risk of allergy.
open degloving injuries are managed by reattaching the viable skin and grafting. closed degloving injuries are managed by draining the accumulated fluid, removing the dead tissue and
sclerotherapy. For severe, multiplanar degloving, amputation is done.
The given image below shows a degloving injury of the lower limb:",,A,5322-3373.PNG
Q6,Rheumatoid arthritis management in a patient with deformity is:,"a)steroids
b)Methotrexate with steroids
c)Methotrexate with anti-TNF
d)steroids only after NsAIDs fail","Methotrexate with anti-TNF is superior to any other treatment in limiting progression of joint destruction and disability.
In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) joint inflammation is the main cause of joint damage and is the most important factor of joint disability and deformities.
Methotrexate belongs to the category of drugs known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). They slow down or prevent the structural progression of RA and hence are used in   most combination therapies. Among the DMARDs, methotrexate is the preferred first-line drug.
Biologic DMARDs such as anti-TNF agents target cytokines and cell-surface molecules to slow the  progression of joint inflammation. These drugs are typically used in combination with background methotrexate therapy.
combination therapy with methotrexate and an anti-TNF drug is the most commonly used next step for the treatment of patients with deformities, having an inadequate response to
methotrexate therapy.
steroids are used when rapid control of the disease is required. They have a rapid onset of action, while the DMARDs take anywhere from 6-12 weeks to come into effect. They can be used as a
cover during this period. steroids can also be used in short courses for acute flare-up episodes of RA. Long-term use of steroids is not advised due to their adverse effects such as osteoporosis.
They are usually not used alone (option A) but are used as an adjunct to DMARDs like methotrexate (option B).
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NsAIDs) are used as adjunctive therapy for the
management of uncontrollable symptoms because of their analgesic and anti-inflammatory
properties. chronic use is not advised due to their side effects namely gastritis and peptic ulcer disease as well as impairment of renal function (option D)



Hence, among the given options methotrexate with anti-TNF is the best therapy in a patient with deformity.",,C,
Q7,A 6o year old woman presents with low backache and on a lumbar CT the following is seen. what is your diagnosis?,"a)spondylolisthesis
b)Discitis
c)osteoporosis
d)pott’s spine","The given image depicts the ballooning of the intervertebral disc into the adjacent
vertebrae leading to biconcave shape of vertebral body and biconvex shape of the disc which is known as the ‘codfish appearance’. This is classically seen in osteoporosis.
osteoporosis is a metabolic disease of the bone that is caused due to an equivalent decrease in
both bone matrix and its mineralization, resulting in a diffuse decrease in both, bone density and  bone mass. It is seen in various conditions namely in postmenopausal females, cushing's disease, and long-term steroid therapy.
The various complications seen in osteoporosis are due to decreased bone mass which contributes to bone pains and increased frequency of pathological fractures such as colle's fracture and neck    of femur fractures. In the vertebrae, the dorso-lumbar spine is the most frequent site to be
involved and can present as increased kyphosis due to compression of the anterior part of the vertebral bodies.
other radiological features of osteoporosis:
• Loss of vertical height of vertebra due to collapse
• Ground glass appearance of bones especially in the bones like pelvis
• Loss of cortical bone (picture frame vertebrae) and trabecular bone (ghost vertebrae)
• Loss of trabeculae in proximal femur area.
DEXA scan is the gold standard for quantifying bone mass in osteoporotic patients. A T-score of less than -2.5 is diagnostic of osteoporosis.
The X-ray given below is of a post-menopausal female with colle's fracture after trivial trauma, caused secondary to osteoporosis.




option A: spondylolisthesis is the anterior translation of one vertebra over another. It commonly occurs between L5-s1 followed by L4-L5. on examination, often there is a visible or palpable
'step'.
A lateral X-ray of the spine shows anterior displacement of one vertebra over another. The oblique view in severe spondylolisthesis shows the 'beheaded scottish terrier sign' (due to a break in pars   interarticularis).
The below-given images depict spondylolisthesis as seen on X-ray:







option D: pott's spine also known as TB spine occurs secondary to a pulmonary or
gastrointestinal primary and spreads through the Batson's plexus of veins (paravertebral plexus). It most commonly involves the dorso-lumbar region.
on X-ray and CT imaging:
• A reduction in disc space is seen between the vertebrae and it is one of the earlieast signs of TB spine
• vertebral body destruction can also be seen- based on the number of vertebrae involved they are called by different names. An involvement of 3-4 vertebrae is called as kyphosis
• Cold abscesses such as paravertebral abscess can be visible as a soft tissue shadow
• Advanced destruction and wedging of vertebrae",5311-3361.PNG,C,5323-3374.PNG;5324-3376.PNG;5324-3375.PNG;5325-3377.PNG
Q8,An 18-year-old boy presents to the orthopedician with complaints of painful swelling below the knee joint. An X-Ray was obtained which is given below. which of the following is the   preferred treatment modality for this patient?,"a)Extended curettage and bone grafting
b)simple curettage and bone grafting
c)Radiofrequency ablation
d)Radical excision","The given x-ray showing an expansile, eccentric, multiloculated lytic lesion, at the end of a long bone with a soap-bubble appearance suggests a giant cell tumor (GCT) or osteoclastoma. The     treatment of choice for this condition is extended curettage and bone grafting.
Giant cell tumor is a benign but locally aggressive tumor seen involving the metaphysis and /or the epiphysis of long bones, as seen in the image, in young adults of age 2o-45 years and rarely teenagers less than 2o years.
Although an aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is also a benign, locally destructive,
eccentric multiloculated lytic tumor that can present with a similar radiographical picture in any age group (most commonly in adolescents), it is confined within the metaphysis of the long
bones, unlike GCT, thus ruling it out in this case. on MRI a fluid sign can be seen.
The following is an x-ray image of the knee showing ABC confined to the metaphysis ofthe long bones:





An ABC is treated by extended curettage and grafting with a bone graft substitute (option B).   GCT is most commonly seen in the distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal humerus, and distal  radius. It presents with complaints of swelling and vague pain and sometimes, the patient can presents for the first time with a pathological fracture because of the lesion.
Important x-ray features of a GCT:
• Eccentric, solitary lytic lesion
• In epiphysis and metaphysis
• Expansile- expands overlying cortex
• soap bubble appearance - due to the trabeculae of the remnants of bone traversing the lytic lesion, giving it a loculated appearance.
• No or minimal reactive sclerosis around the tumor
• No calcification
Histologically, GCTs consist of undifferentiated spindle cells profusely interspersed
with multi-nucleated giant cells. The tumor stroma is well-vascularized with bands of cellular or collagenous fibrous tissue.
The treatment of choice for GCT is by
• Extended curettage and bone grafting (option A).
• GCT in the relatively insignificant bone like the distal ulna, clavicle, and proximal fibula is treated by resection without reconstruction.
• Bisphosphonates have been shown to reduce the proliferation of osteoclasts and hence have been shown to stabilize local and metastatic disease.
• Radiotherapy can be used for vertebral tumors
• Additional supportive therapy such as cryotherapy, when used reduce the reccurence rate.",5312-3362.PNG,A,5326-3378.PNG
Q9,The following images A and B show:,"a)Mallet finger &amp; Jersey finger
b)Boxer fracture &amp; march fracture
c)Mallet finger &amp; boxer fracture
d)Jersey finger &amp; baseball finger","The following image shows the Jersey finger and baseball finger respectively.
• Jersey finger - is an avulsion injury of the flexor digitorum profundus at the insertion of the base of the distal phalanx with the ring finger most commonly involved. It is caused due to sudden
hyperextension of the distal joint.
• Baseball finger (also known as mallet finger)- is a disruption to the extensor tendon at the DIP joint due to collision with a hard object (like a ball) forcing it to flex past its normal range of
motion. clinically, the distal phalanx is in slight flexion in this condition.
other options:
Boxer's fracture is the break in the metacarpal neck, most commonly of the fifth finger following a blow with the fist.
The x-ray given below shows Boxer's fracture:


March fracture is a stress fracture of the neck of the 2nd or 3rd metatarsal The X-ray given below shows March fracture:",5313-3363.PNG,D,5327-3379.PNG;5327-3379-1.png
