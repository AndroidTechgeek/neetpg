Q1,"You are attending physiology viva. The examiner asks you who recorded the first EEG. You say ""I don't know "". The examiner feels bad for you and gives you a clue that ""the name
sounds like something you get commonly in McDonalds"". You remember the name and answer correctly. what type of memory has been implicated here?""","a)semantic memory
b)Implicit memory
c)Associative learning
d)priming","In the given scenario, priming is the most appropriate answer.
The examiner is asking for a fact, and then prompting the answer, by giving a clue which sounds (phonological) like the answer. This is an example of priming.
prime is any cue, which precedes the recall of the target word. It maybe similar to hear (sun-bun-gun) or may hold similarity to the target word (sun- moon - star).",,D,
Q2,A known alcoholic patient is brought to the emergency in a disoriented state. He complains of seeing snakes and insects crawling on his skin. which of the following should be given to this  patient?,"a)Haloperidol + thiamine
b)Lorazepam only
c)Lorazepam + thiamine
d)Haloperidol only","The given clinical scenario points towards delirium tremens likely due to acute alcohol
withdrawal. Lorazepam + thiamine should be given to this patient.
Delirium tremens occurs after 2-4 days of abstinence in a heavy or chronic drinker. It is
characterized by autonomic hyperactivity, tremors, delusions, and hallucinations. It usually     resolves spontaneously in 7 days but may cause the death of the patient due to cardiovascular collapse or infections or self-injury.
Delirium tremens is treated using benzodiazepines starting with a higher dosage which is
gradually tapered as withdrawal symptoms disappear. In cases of chronic alcohol use, vitamin
deficiency (especially thiamine) may be co-existing and hence bolus doses of thiamine are given to prevent/treat wernicke encephalopathy.
Haloperidol is generally not the first-line drug in case of alcoholic withdrawal. It might be used as an add-on in agitated patients. It decreases the seizure threshold and its use would be appropriate in a case of co-existing psychotic disorder like schizophrenia.

Q3,A drug that selectively reduces the reuptake of serotonin would likely cause which of the following side effects?,"a)constipation
b)sexual dysfunction
c)sialorrhea
d)visual disturbance","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are associated with sexual dysfunction.

Q4,A patient undergoing ECT for his severe depression was given thiopentone and succinylcholine. The purpose of these medications was to?,"a)To bring calming effect
b)To produce mood elevation
c)To induce anesthesia and relax muscles
d)To prevent memory loss after the ECT","Thiopentone and succinylcholine are given for anesthesia induction and muscle relaxation respectively.
Thiopentone sodium is a barbiturate and acts by opening chloride channels, whilst succinylcholine is a depolarising muscle relaxant.
EcT can be of 2 types:



• Direct - without anesthesia and muscle relaxant
• Modified - with anesthesia and muscle relaxant
currently modified EcT is preferred and is given with adequate spacing i.e., no more than 3 EcT sessions per week.
After adequate preparation, a current of 2oo-16oomA (11ov for o.1-1 seconds) is given, resulting in an adequate seizure. Electroconvulsive therapy treatments are associated with retrograde
amnesia for a period of several minutes before the treatment and anterograde amnesia after the treatment.",,C,
Q5,"A young male who is shy and prefers social isolation appears to be emotionally cold and
resides alone. There is no history of hallucinations or delusions. The most likely diagnosis is","a)paranoid personality disorder
b)schizoid personality disorder
c)Antisocial personality disorder
d)Emotionally unstable personality disorder","The diagnosis, in this case, is schizoid personality disorder.
schizoid personality disorder is a cluster A personality disorder. The patient neither desires nor enjoys close relationships (shy and prefers social isolation, resides alone as in the question) and shows emotional coldness and detachment.
In contrast, subjects with emotionally unstable (borderline) personality disorder cannot tolerate being alone, and they search for companionship.",,B,
Q6,"A 4o-year-old male patient comes to the psychiatry OpD with complaints of repetitive thoughts that, he always feels his hands are dirty, though they are not. This gives him
discomfort and hence he has to wash them again and again. This is a disorder of thought .","a)Flow
b)Form
c)possession
d)Content","The clinical history is suggestive of obsessive-compulsive disorder, which is a disorder of thought possession.
The diseases under thought possession include:
• obsession and compulsion
• Thought Alienation
In obsessions and compulsions, although the sense of thought possession in the patient is not     impaired, he/she experiences the obsessive thoughts to appear against their will. Hence, despite the patient perceiving a loss of control over the voluntary act (compulsion), they still retain
personal possession (ownership) of the act.
obsessive-compulsive disorder is defined as the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions.
• obsessions are recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced as intrusive and unwanted and cause anxiety or distress to the patients.
• compulsions are the repetitive and intentional behaviors or acts performed in response to
obsessions or according to certain rules that must be applied rigidly (e.g., repetitive hand washing, ritualistic checking).
In the given case, the obsessional thoughts are the repetitive, unwanted thoughts that his hands are dirty, while the compulsion is to wash his hands to neutralize the obsession.",,C,3787-2423.PNG

Q9,"A 7-year-old child presented with complaints of bed-wetting almost twice a week for the past 1 year. A detailed investigation was done to rule out the organic cause. what should be the
treatment plan for this child?","a)pharmacotherapy with imipramine
b)psychodynamic psychotherapy
c)Bladder training, with reward for delaying micturition during daytime
d)Bell and pad based classical conditioning","The clinical features are suggestive of nocturnal enuresis. Bell and pad based classical
conditioning is the most effective treatment.
Nocturnal enuresis refers to the occurrence of involuntary urination at night after 5 years of age. It may be a normal phenomenon in children up to 5 years of age.
Treatment for nocturnal enuresis may include:
Behavioural therapy:
• classic conditioning with the bell (or buzzer) and pad (alarm) apparatus is the most effective treatment for enuresis.
• Dryness is achieved in 5o% of the cases.
• Bladder training with encouragement or reward for delaying micturition for increasing times during waking hours is useful but considered inferior to bell and pad.



pharmacotherapy:
• Medications should be considered if behavioural therapy has failed, and if enuresis is causing impairment in social, family, and school function.
• Desmopressin (an antidiuretic) and Reboxetine (norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) are commonly used drugs. Reboxetine is considered as a safer alternative to imipramine.
psychotherapy:
• It is indicated in cases with chronic enuresis, to deal with any coexisting psychiatric problems and emotional and family difficulties.",,D,
Q10,"A male patient who lost his job recently became irritable and had a sad mood for most of the time. Thinking about the future worried him and he felt irritation towards his family
members. He occasionally went out to watch movies with his friends and was able to enjoy but on returning home he felt similar symptoms. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)Generalised anxiety disorder
b)Adjustment disorder
c)Mixed anxiety with depression
d)Moderate depression","The clinical features are suggestive of an adjustment disorder.
Adjustment disorder is an emotional response to a stressful event. stressors may be single like    loss of job or divorce; multiple like the death of a parent together with loss of a job; or recurrent like seasonal business difficulties.
Diagnosing criteria for adjustment disorder:
• Development of emotional or behavioural response within 3 months of the onset of the stressor.
• The symptoms or behaviour are clinically significant, where, any one of the following are met:
• The response is out of proportion to the severity or intensity of the stressor.
• significant impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning.
• The stress-related disturbance does not meet the criteria for another mental disorder or exacerbation of pre-existing mental disorder.
• Mostly depressive but can also have anxiety symptoms.
• The symptoms disappear within 6 months if the stressor is removed.
In the given case, it has been mentioned that the patient lost his job recently. Although a time
period is not mentioned in the question, the term recently can be understood as well within the 3  months duration. The patient's behaviour such as sad and irritated affected his social functioning. As he was finding joy in watching movies, depression can be ruled out.",,B,
Q11,A 1o-year-old child is suffering from selective mutism. He is most probably suffering from?,"a)childhood depression
b)childhood psychosis
c)childhood anxiety disorder
d)Hyperkinetic disorder","The child is most likely suffering from a childhood anxiety disorder.
selective mutism refers to the lack of speaking (being mute) in one or more specific social
situations, commonly in school, but speaking well in other situations, commonly at home. The   child may be either completely silent at school or maybe just whispering. Rarely, a child may be silent at home but communicating normally at school.
The disorder may develop in children between 4 to 8 years of age and is associated with a social anxiety disorder. They may have symptoms of separation anxiety disorder, school refusal, and



delayed language acquisition.
The first-line treatment includes cognitive behavioural therapy.
option A and B: selective mutism is not commonly associated with childhood depression or psychosis
option D: Hyperkinetic disorder is associated with overfamiliarity.",,C,
Q12,A psychotic patient developed voluntary purposeless movements and was once observed to be standing still for hours with waxy flexibility and negativism. what is the appropriate medical   management?,"a)Haloperidol
b)Lorazepam
c)clonidine
d)propanolol","The clinical features are suggestive of a catatonic disorder. Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are effective in the treatment of catatonia.
catatonia is a syndrome characterized by striking behavioral abnormalities such as motoric
immobility or excitement, negativism, or echolalia (mimicry of speech), or echopraxia (mimicry of movement).
The clinical picture may include three or more of the following features:
• stupor: Absence of psychomotor activity and not actively relating to the environment.
• catalepsy: passive induction of a posture held against gravity.
• waxy flexibility: slight, even resistance to positioning by examiner.
• Negativism: opposition or no response to instructions or external stimuli.
• posturing: spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against gravity.
• Mannerism: odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions.
• stereotypy: Repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal-directed movements
• Automatic obedience: commands are followed automatically, irrespective of their nature.
• Grimacing
• Ambitendency: Due to ambivalence, opposing actions are carried out.
• Echopraxia: Mimicking another's movement.
• Echolalia: Mimicking another's speech.
• Mutism: very little or no verbal response to instructions or external stimuli.
• verbigeration: Incomprehensible speech.
catatonic disorder may occur due to:
• Advanced mood or psychotic illnesses
• Neurological disorders (e.g., nonconvulsive status epilepticus, and head trauma)
• Infections (e.g., encephalitis)
• Metabolic disturbances (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy, hyponatremia, and hypercalcemia)
• Drugs induced- like corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and antipsychotics (i.e., neuroleptic)
agents.



Management: The primary treatment includes:
• Identifying and treating underlying medical or pharmacological causes. Any offending substances should be removed.
• Benzodiazepines, especially, lorazepam, are effective in improving the symptoms.
• Electroconvulsive therapy is the definitive treatment in cases of life-threatening catatonia (if the patient is unable to eat) or if the patient has developed malignant catatonia.",,B,
Q13,which of the following features differentiate delirium from dementia in Alzheimer's disease?,"a)Acuity of onset and agitation
b)Acuity of onset and loss of consciousness
c)visual hallucinations and impaired memory
d)Agitation and irritation","Delirium is characterized by acute onset of symptoms and is often accompanied by diminished or loss of consciousness and cognition. This feature is useful to clinically differentiate between  delirium and dementia.
Dementia is a group of diseases marked by chronic, progressive cognitive impairment with clear consciousness.",,B,
