Q1,"A patient from uttar pradesh presented with fever, pallor, and hepatosplenomegaly.
peripheral smear examination showed pancytopenia. Buffy coat examination showed    macrophages laden with organisms with a kinetoplast. what is the vector for the likely disease?","a)sandfly
b)Tse-Tse fly
c)Triatomine bug
d)Female anopheles mosquito","From the given clinical features, the most likely disease is visceral leishmaniasis or kala azar caused by Leishmania donovani, and the vector is sandfly. A patient from uttar pradesh
presenting with fever, pallor, and hepatosplenomegaly with a smear examination showing pancytopenia and macrophages containing organisms with kinetoplasts point towards the diagnosis.
Leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of an infected female phlebotomus sandfly. In India, it is endemic to Bihar, west Bengal, Jharkhand, and uttar pradesh. patients present with high fever,   hepatosplenomegaly, weight loss, and emaciation. The skin becomes dry, rough, and darkly
pigmented. There is anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.
The parasite exists in 2 forms:
• Amstigote form (also called LD bodies)- It is seen within macrophages and contains a kinetoplast.
• promastigote form- It is the infective form in the sandfly. The kinetoplast is seen at the anterior end.
kinetoplast are non-nuclear DNA present in addition to nucleus. They consist of blepharoplast and parabasal body. Flagellum originates near the kinetoplast.
Diagnosis of kala-azar is mainly by demonstration of amastigotes within macrophages in tissue aspirates such as blood smears, bone marrow, splenic, or lymph node aspirate. It is the gold
standard for diagnosis.
The image below shows amastigotes located intracellularly within macrophages.


Treatment is with a pentavalent antimonial compound. In Bihar, there is resistance to antimony so amphotericin-B-deoxycholate or miltefosine is preferred.
In human beings, different species of Leishmania can cause the following diseases:
• visceral leishmaniasis, or kala-azar, • cutaneous leishmaniasis,
• Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, and

• Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis.
The life cycle of Lesihmania is shown below.


other options:
option B: Tse-Tse fly (Glossina species) is involved in the transmission of sleeping sickness or African trypanosomiasis. It is caused by Trypanosoma brucei. The patient can have
hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy in the early stages and later on CNs involvement is seen. Blood routine examination would reveal anemia, leucocytosis, and thrombocytopenia.
option C: Triatomine bug (Reduviid bug/ kissing bug) transmits Trypanosoma cruzi infection
leading to Chaga's disease or American trypansomiasis. The acute phase of the disease is
characterized by a typical subcutaneous lesion at the site of inoculation called chagoma. In the
chronic phase, multiorgan involvement occurs leading to cardiac myopathy, megaesophagus, and megacolon.
option-D: Female anopheles mosquito leads to the transmission of malaria caused
by plasmodium species. Malaria can present with fever and hepatosplenomegaly but the morphological forms commonly include the ring forms or the gametocytes.",,A,1553-971.PNG;1554-972.PNG
Q2,"A patient who was on steroids for the treatment of chronic urticaria presents to the
emergency department with acute worsening of respiratory symptoms. He says that he has been having nocturnal cough for last several weeks. A hemogram revealed elevated
eosinophils. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen following bronchoscopy showed the presence of certain larvae as shown in the image below. Identify the causative organism.","a)Ancylostoma caninum
b)capillaria philippinensis
c)strongyloides stercoralis
d)Enterobius vermicularis","The presence of eosinophilia in an immunosuppressed patient with respiratory symptoms and BAL revealing rhabditiform larvae is suggestive of disseminated strongyloidiasis caused
by strongyloides stercoralis.
strongyloidiasis:
strongyloides are ovoviviparous. The transmission of infection occurs through penetration of the skin by filariform larvae in the soil. Then, they migrate to the small intestine. The larvae moult
twice and become adult female worms in the small intestine. The eggs laid in the mucosa of the
intestine hatch immediately releasing the rhabditiform larva (L1 stage). These rhabditiform larvae in the bowel can develop directly into filariform larvae that penetrate the colonic wall or perianal

skin and enter the circulation to repeat the migration. This establishes ongoing internal reinfection.
The life cycle of strongyloides is shown below.


It is generally a benign and asymptomatic condition. In some cases, there may be cutaneous, pulmonary, and intestinal manifestations. pulmonary manifestations occur when the larva
escapes from the pulmonary capillaries into the alveoli leading to bronchopneumonia, chronic bronchitis, and asthmatic symptoms.
The term larva currens (meaning ‘racing larvae’) has been applied to the rapidly progressing linear or serpiginous urticarial tracks caused by migrating filariform larvae of strongyloides stercoralis.   These often follow autoinfection and start perianally. Disseminated strongyloidiasis is seen in
immunodeficient individuals.
Larva currens is shown in the image below.


visceral larva migrans is caused by the migration of larvae of nonhuman species of nematodes that infect via the oral route.
Etiological agents causing visceral larva migrans:
• Human nematode: Ascaris lumbricoides, strongyloides stercoralis.
• zoophilic nematode: Toxocara canis, toxocara cati, Angiostrongylus cantoniensis, Angiostrongylus costaricensis, Anisakis.
• Non human nematode: Filarial species, Brugia pahangi, Brugia pate
Laboratory diagnosis of strongyloidiasis:
• Eosinophilia and raised IgE levels.
• Microscopic examination of the direct wet mount of the stool demonstrating rhabditiform larvae forms the definitive diagnosis
• stool culture and serological tests are also done
Treatment: Ivermectin is the preferred agent in the management of strongyloidiasis.
other options:
option A: Ancylostoma canium presents with creeping eruption. cutaneous larva
migrans or creeping eruption is caused by nematode larvae that infect by skin penetration.
option B: capillaria phillipinesis can also cause auto-infection. It commonly presents with severe diarrhea.
option D: Enterobius vermicularis or pinworm infection presents as itching (pruritus) and restless sleep (due to nocturnal perianal or perineal pruritus)",1548-968.PNG,C,1554-972.PNG;1555-973.PNG
Q3,"A patient admitted with 5o% burns develops an infection at the burn site. The swab was
cultured, the isolate is a strict aerobe and the test that is shown in the image is positive. what is the likely etiology of the burn infection?","a)klebsiella
b)Escherichia coli
c)pseudomonas aeruginosa
d)salmonella","pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common cause of infection in the case of a burn. The given image shows a positive oxidase test. psuedomonas aeruginosa is a strict aerobe and shows
a positive oxidase reaction.
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, non-lactose  fermenting bacteria that shows swarming motility. They produce a characteristic blue-green  pigment called pyocyanin and a greenish-yellow pigment called fluorescein/pyoverdin. other pigments produced by these organisms include pyorubin (Red), pyomelanin (Brown).
Diseases caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa include-
• Malignant otitis externa in diabetics
• pneumonia and sepsis in cystic fibrosis
• wound infection and sepsis in burns
• Hot tub folliculitis/pseudomonas aeruginosa folliculitis/ Jacuzzi syndrome is a type of folliculitis, occurring after hot tub exposure
• shanghai fever is a febrile illness that manifests as severe enteric disease, sepsis with invasive disease.

• Ecthyma gangrenosum
pathogenesis - It is an obligate aerobe that exerts its pathogenicity by the production
of diphtheria-like exotoxin A and a slime layer. Breach in primary body defenses as in burns predisposes to pseudomonas infection.
clinical features - It is characterized by blue-green pus. It is notorious for being resistant to
antimicrobials and antiseptics and hence is a frequent contaminant in hospital samples. Repeated isolation and associated clinical features should prompt the diagnosis of pseudomonas.
Diagnosis - It grows well on most media and pigment production makes its identification
easy. species identification is made possible by biochemical tests - arginine hydrolysis and oxidase reaction.
pseudomonas aeruginosa growth in a nutrient agar showing green coloured colonies are shown in the image below.


oxidase test can be used to distinguish organisms by detecting the presence or absence of a
respiratory enzyme, cytochrome oxidase. cytochrome oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of reduced cytochrome by oxygen. Enterobacteriaceae (klebsiella, E. coli, salmonella ) are oxidase negative.
oxidase positive organisms:
• pseudomonas
• vibrio
• Helicobacter
• campylobacter
• pasteurella
• Legionella
• Neisseria
• Brucella
• Moraxella

• Burkholderia",1549-969.PNG,C,1557-975.PNG
Q4,"one week after having unprotected sexual intercourse, a 25-year-old male develops urethral discharge as shown in the image below. what is the most likely causative organism for this   condition?","a)Neisseria gonorrheae
b)ureaplasma urealyticum
c)Herpes simplex virus
d)Trichomonas vaginalis","The given image shows purulent urethral discharge that developed one week after unprotected   sexual intercourse is suggestive of acute urethritis. The most likely causative organism for acute urethritis in males is Neisseria gonorrheae.
purulent urethral discharge can be seen in gonorrhea caused by Neisseria gonorrhea
or lymphogranuloma venerum caused by chlamydia trachomatis.
Gonorrhea:
Gonorrhea is a disease acquired by sexual contact. The first step in infection is the infection of
gonococci to the urethra or other mucosal surfaces. pilli is involved in this adhesion. The cocci
penetrate the intracellular spaces and reach subepithelial tissue by the third day of infection. The incubation period is 2-8 days. The major symptoms include urethral discharge and dysuria,
usually without urinary frequency or urgency. The specific symptoms seen in males and females are as follows:
In males :
• The disease starts as acute urethritis. This infection may extend along the urethra to involve the prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymis.
• chronic urethritis may lead to stricture formation.
• The infection may spread to the periurethral tissues causing abscesses and multiple discharging sinuses (watercan perineum).
In females :
• The initial infection involves the cervix uteri and urethra which may extend to Bartholin glands, endometrium, and fallopian tubes.
• The vaginal mucosa is not usually affected in adults because the stratified squamous epithelium is resistant to infection by the cocci, and also because of the acidic pH of vaginal secretions.
• pelvic inflammatory disease and salpingitis may lead to sterility.
• Rarely peritonitis may develop with perihepatic inflammation (Fitz Hugh curtis syndrome)
Lab diagnosis:
The discharge is collected and subjected to Gram's stain which reveals gram■negative
intracellular diplococci within phagocytes. stuart's transport medium is used. cultures can be
obtained from chocolate agar or Mueller-Hinton agar. specifically, Thayer-Martin agar is used to isolate Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
Treatment: ceftriaxone (25omg, IM) single-dose + azithromycin 1 g po, single-dose, or doxycycline 1oo mg po BD for 7 days

Non-gonococcal urethritis is caused by:
• Chlamydia trachomatis
• ureaplasma urealyticum (option-B)
• Mycoplasma genitalium
• Trichomonas vaginalis (option-D)
• Herpes simplex virus (rare)
• Adenovirus
• Haemophillus vaginalis
• Mycoplasma genitalium
other options:
option B: ureaplasma urealyticum is the second most common cause of non-gonococcal urethritis next to chlamydia. That is why the initial etiological agent under suspicion always remains
gonorrhea.
option C: Herpes simplex will be associated with vesicular lesions.
option D: Trichomonas vaginalis generally presents with a frothy discharge.",1550-970.PNG,A,1559-976.PNG
Q5,"An unimmunized 2-year old child presented with coryza, conjunctivitis, and bluish-white spots in his buccal mucosa near the lower molar teeth. A day later, he developed a
maculopapular rash on the face and neck. what is the nature of the causative virus?","a)Enveloped ss RNA
b)Naked ss RNA
c)Naked ds RNA
d)Enveloped ds RNA","Fever, coryza, conjunctivitis, maculopapular rash and koplik spots are suggestive of
measles. Measles virus is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus.
koplik spots are small, bluish-white ulcerations on the inner aspect of the cheek at the level of premolars. These are pathognomic for measles. The measles virus, a paramyxovirus, has an
incubation period of 7-18 days. After this, the prodrome phase begins with mild fever,
conjunctivitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and pathognomic koplik spots. This is followed

by the eruptive stage, characterised by the appearance of maculopapular rash on the 4th day of fever. The rash begins on the face and spreads to the torso and extremities. Lymphadenopathy  may be present.
These are multinucleated giant cells formed by the fusion of infected cells. The images below show the characteristic rashes and the koplik spots seen in measles.



The most common complication of measles is acute otitis media. sinusitis and mastoiditis are also seen. The most common cause of death in measles is pneumonia, which may be giant cell
pneumonia. It is caused by the virus directly or can be due to superadded bacterial
infection. Black measles or hemorrhagic measles is a fatal complication characterized by hemorrhagic skin eruptions. It is rarely seen nowadays.
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a rare but fatal complication characterized by cognitive decline, spasticity of limbs, and seizures. It is insidious in onset and clinical manifestations
usually begin 7-1o years after primary measles infection. It is caused due to persistent infection with a genetically altered variant of the measles virus within the central nervous system. other

complications include croup, tracheitis, bronchiolitis, diarrhea and vomiting, febrile seizures, and encephalitis.
The diagnosis of measles infection is mainly clinical but may be confirmed by serological
demonstration of IgM antibodies. IgM antibodies appear 1-2 days after the rash and are detectable for 1 month. The management is mainly supportive. There is no role for antivirals. Low serum
retinol levels in children with measles are associated with higher morbidity and mortality and hence vitamin A therapy is indicated for all patients with measles.
Live attenuated vaccine for measles is safe and effective with no evidence of person-to-person
transfer of vaccine strains. It is a freeze-dried product requiring reconstitution. o.5ml is
administered subcutaneously in the right upper arm in 2 doses- at the 9th month and between the 16th - 24th month.",,A,1560-978.PNG;1560-977.PNG
Q6,"A group of 2o friends kept partying till late at night. Two of them ate pastries from outside. They present with nausea and vomiting in the early morning. what is the most likely
causative agent implicated?","a)Enterotoxin of staphylococcus
b)Emetic toxin of Bacillus cereus
c)verocytotoxin from E. coli
d)shiga toxin from shigella","The most likely causative agent in the given scenario is enterotoxin of staphylococcus aureus.
It causes food poisoning within 3o minutes to 6 hours after consumption of the contaminated food.
The common sources of infection are the foods that are not cooked after handling. These
include sliced meats, puddings, pastries, and sandwiches. patients present with nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and diarrhea.
Food poisoning is caused by enterotoxin produced by s. aureus. It is a preformed toxin that is
relatively heat stable while most of the other exotoxins are heat-labile. It stimulates the vagus
nerve and vomiting center of the brain and also stimulates intestinal peristaltic activity. Eight
antigenic types of enterotoxin are currently known of which Type  A toxin is responsible for most cases.
other options:
option B: Food poisoning after consumption of fried rice or chinese street food is strongly
suggestive of Bacillus cereus (serotypes 1, 3, 5). Two mechanisms of action have been described    for the enterotoxin of B.cereus, one involving stimulation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMp) system and the other independent of it.
Food poisoning after eating food contaminated with Bacillus cereus is of two types, namely diarrheal type and emetic type, caused by an enterotoxin and an emetic toxin respectively.

Bacillus cereus	Diarrheal type	Emetic type
Incubation peri od	8-16 hours	1-5 hours
Toxin	secreted in intestine	preformed
Heat	Heat labile	Heat stable
Food items	Meat	Rice
clinical feature	Diarrhea, abdominal cram ps	vomiting, abdominal cra mps


option c: verocytotoxin from E.coli is also known as shiga-like toxin and it causes bloody
diarrhea. It is produced by enterohemorrhagic E.coli. It can cause illnesses ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal hemorrhagic colitis and hemorrhagic uremic syndrome.
option D: shiga toxin acts by inactivating 6os ribosomal subunit thereby inhibiting protein
synthesis. shigella dysenteriae causes acute onset of symptoms(fever, abdominal cramps)
with dysentery and tenesmus. It also gives a positive sereny test and is non-lactose fermenting.",,A,
Q7,"A 3-year old child presents with fever, loose stools, and blood in the stool. what is the enrichment medium used to isolate the organism from the stool sample?","a)Robertson cooked meat broth
b)Alkaline peptone water
c)selenite F broth
d)Brain heart infusion broth","The given clinical vignette of dysentery (bloody stools) and abdominal pain in a child is suggestive of bacillary dysentery most likely caused due to shigella. selenite F broth is used as
an enrichment media for dysentery-causing bacteria like shigella/ salmonella.
Enrichment media:
It is used to suppress commensal bacteria while allowing the pathogen to remain viable and grow. common examples include:
• Tetrathionate broth – It inhibits coliforms and allows typhoid and paratyphoid bacilli to grow.
• selenite F broth – used for dysentery causing bacteria.
• Alkaline peptone water (option-B) - used for vibrio cholera causing watery diarrhea.
other options:
Robertson's cooked meat broth (option-A): It is used for the culture of anaerobic organisms.
Brain-heart infusion broth (option-D): It is an enriched media. It is used for the cultivation of fastidious organisms.
Dysentery/shigellosis is a type of food poisoning caused by infection with the shigella species. It is spread through faeco-oral transmission. They are catalse-negative, non-lactose-fermenting,
gram-negative rods, and are non-motile. It acts by inactivating the 6os ribosomal subunit thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. It causes acute onset of symptoms(fever, abdominal cramps) with
dysentery and tenesmus. It also gives a positive sereny test.",,C,
Q8,"A truck driver came with complaints of a painless indurated genital ulcer after unsafe
intercourse. Motility of the most likely causative organism can be detected by which of the following microscopes?","a)Dark field microscope
b)Electron microscope
c)Light microscope
d)Fluorescent microscope","The clinical vignette of a painless, indurated genital ulcer in a truck driver is most likely
suggestive of syphilitic chancre / hard chancre caused by Treponema pallidum. The motility of the organism can be demonstrated by dark ground/ field microscopy.
Dark ground microscopy can be used to diagnose syphilis when an active chancre or condyloma lata is present to visualize Treponema pallidum. Dark-field microscopy images have a dark
background with a refractile organism. The dark ground microscope has an optical system that enhances the contrast of unstained bodies. It is generally less sensitive.
various types of spirochetes and their appearances under a dark ground microscope:
• Treponemes generally are short, slender with regular and sharp spirals.

• Leptospira have a large number of closely wound spirals and characteristic hooked ends.
• Borrelia is large with irregular and wide open coils.
The image given below shows Treponema pallidum demonstrated by dark ground microscopy and the various appearances of other spirochetes respectively.



other options:
Electron microscopy (option-B) is not commonly used for diagnostics in laboratories. It generally helps in appreciating viral structures.
Light microscopes (option-C) are commonly used in the labs to visualize the stained smears of     various bacteria, fungi in 1oox magnification. They are also used during the examination of stool specimens for identifying ova, eggs, or larvae.
Fluorescent microscope (option-D) uses fluorescent dyes like auramine-rhodamine to appreciate Mycobacterial species and malarial parasites.

syphilis:
syphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum, a spirochete bacillus.
It shows corkscrew motility which can be demonstrated by darkfield microscopy. smear
specimens are stained using Fontana stain and pathological tissues are stained using Levaditi stain.
serologic tests for syphilis recommended by the centers for Disease control and Prevention (cDc):
• screening or diagnosis (RPR or VDRL),
• Quantitative measurement of antibody to assess clinical syphilis activity or to monitor response to therapy (RPR or VDRL)
• confirmation of a syphilis diagnosis in a patient with a reactive RPR or VDRL test (FTA-ABs, TPHA, EIA/cIA)
Treatment of syphilis is with 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin IM.

Q9,Name the parasite whose microfilaria have a sheath with no nuclei at the tail end.,"a)wuchereria bancrofti
b)Brugia malayi
c)Brugia timori
d)Mansonella perstans","A sheathed microfilaria with a pointed tail free of nuclei is suggestive of wuchereria bancrofti. wuchereria bancrofti causes lymphatic filariasis and most cases are seen in India.
clinical features include massive eosinophilia, hepatosplenomegaly, pulmonary manifestations like dry nocturnal cough, asthmatic wheezing, and dyspnea. It can also cause arthritis,
glomerulonephritis, thrombophlebitis, etc. The classical features seen in lymphatic filariasis are usually absent.
Elephantiasis refers to the painful swelling of the legs and genital organs seen in late-stage disease.
Image showing elephantiasis-



Investigations:
Demonstration of the microfilaria in peripheral blood, chylous urine, hydrocele fluid, etc is done. The specimen of choice is peripheral blood. Night blood samples between 1o pm and 4 am are
preferred. This is because the microfilaria shows nocturnal periodicity.
DEC provocation test: In this test, a small dose of DEC is given 2o-5o minutes before sample collection so that the microfilaria appears in the blood even during the daytime.

Q10,"In a case of tinea capitis, white powdery colonies were isolated from the hair specimen. The   hair perforation test was positive on the isolate. which of the following is the likely etiology?","a)Epidermophyton floccosum
b)Microsporum audonii
c)Trichophyton mentagrophytes
d)Microsporum gypseum","A positive hair perforation test is caused by Trichophyton mentagrophytes.
Hair perforation test:
It is done to differentiate Trichophyton rubrum from T.mentagrophytes. Few strands of human
hair are placed in a petri dish with 2o ml of distilled water and autoclaved. A few drops of sterile    1o% yeast extract and a few fragments of the test fungus are added to the hair strands. The entire  dish is then incubated at 25oc for 2-3 weeks. The hair is removed and examined microscopically    in lactophenol cotton blue-stained wet preparation. T.mentagrophytes cause surface erosion of the shaft resulting in the wedge-shaped appearance of the shaft.
The image below shows surface erosion of shaft caused by Trichophyton mentagrophytes.


Tinea capitis refers to ringworm of the scalp where there is an invasion of the hair shafts by
dermatophyte fungi (Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton). It presents as hair loss with inflammation, with or without itching. Diagnosis is based on clinical features, wood's lamp, and laboratory investigations such as culture with microscopic examination of the colonies.
• Trichophyton: colonies may be powdery, velvety, or waxy with characteristic pigment based on the species
• T. rubrum: Red
• T. mentagrophytes: white-tan
• T. tonsurans: cream-yellow
• Microsporum: colonies are white, cotton-like, velvety, or powdery
• M. audouinii: Brownish
• M. gypseum: Buff colored
• Epidermophyton: colonies are greenish-yellow and powdery
Treatment is with antifungals like terbinafine, itraconazole, and griseofulvin.",,C,1566-983.PNG
Q11,"A patient was suspected to have acute brucellosis. A serum sample was sent for a standard
agglutination test. It came out to be negative initially but after serial dilutions of the serum     sample, the test turned out to be positive. which of the following is responsible for the initial negative test?","a)Incomplete antibodies
b)complement inactivation
c)prozone phenomenon
d)post-zone phenomenon","The initial negative test is explained by the prozone phenomenon. The standard agglutination     test is a tube agglutination test that mainly identifies IgM antibodies. It is used in establishing a diagnosis of acute brucellosis.
prozone phenomenon refers to the failure of a visible precipitation reaction due to inhibition of lattice formation by the presence of excessive antibodies. This gives rise to
a false-negative test. This excess in antibodies can be overcome by diluting the serum sample, leading to an increase in the antigen-antibody interactions, eventually giving rise to a positive result.
Lattice hypothesis:
The lattice hypothesis explains precipitation reactions. The amount of precipitate formed is greatly influenced by the relative proportions of antigens and antibodies.
• prozone phenomenon: caused by excessive antibodies in the test system. (weak/absent precipitation- false-negative test)
• zone of equivalence: Antigens and antibodies are in optimum proportions
and maximum precipitation occurs.
• post–zone phenomenon: (option-D) Due to the presence of excessive antigen in the test system. (weaker/absent precipitation)



Standard agglutination test identifies mainly IgM antibodies, hence it is useful in acute
brucellosis. Following 7-1o days of infection, both IgM and IgG antibodies appear. The IgM
antibodies then gradually fall and only IgG antibodies persist in chronic brucellosis. The
complement fixation test (option-B) is more useful in chronic cases as it detects the IgG antibody also.
Brucellosis/ undulant fever:
Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease caused by gram-negative, capnophilic coccobacilli. The most  important species that are pathologic to humans are B.melitensis, B. suis, and B.abortus. It is transmitted to humans from contact with or consumption of contaminated products.
These bacteria proliferate within the reticuloendothelial system, which accounts for its resistance to simple antimicrobial therapy.
patients with acute infection may present with undulant fever, arthralgia, muscular
pain, sweating, loss of weight, and appetite. cNS symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, and
depression might also occur. chronic infection tends to be episodic with non-specific symptoms.
Laboratory diagnosis of brucellosis includes:
• polymerase chain reaction
• Blood culture with castaneda method
• Serological methods include standard agglutination test (SAT), complement fixation test, coomb’s antiglobulin test, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
• Tests for animals and animal products: Milk ring tests and Rose Bengal card tests.
• Milk ring test- A sample of milk is mixed with stained brucella antigen and incubated. If the sample contains antibodies, agglutination occurs seen as a blue ring.
Treatment includes antimicrobial therapy with IM streptomycin and oral doxycycline. prevention of brucellosis can be achieved by pasteurization of milk and milk products.
The images below show the casteneda's medium and the milk ring test respectively.",,C,1568-985.PNG;1569-987.PNG;1569-986.PNG
