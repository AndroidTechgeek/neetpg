Q1,A lady developed a skin reaction as shown in the image after using a hair dye. which of the following chemicals is responsible for this condition?,"a)pollen
b)chromates
c)Balsam of peru
d)p-phenylenediamine","This is most likely a case of hypersensitivity reaction caused by p-phenylenediamine (PPD), which is present in hair dyes.
Hair dyes such as PPD have the potential to cause contact dermatitis. 1o% of PPD users tend to develop contact dermatitis. A patch test is recommended 24-48 hours before its usage either on the forearm or behind the ear. The appearance of any redness, blistering, or swelling implies
allergy;  therefore, the application of dye is not recommended. cross-sensitization with other aromatic benzenes is also noted, which needs to be avoided.
Hair dyes can trigger acute edema and intense pruritus, followed by desquamation. Hair dye can elicit an allergic reaction on the forehead. PPD in the hair dye can also cause an erythema
multiforme–like reaction.
In PPD-associated allergies, there is edema and weeping of the scalp margins, eyes, and ears.
There may be relative sparing of the scalp. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions present as
urticaria, and contact anaphylaxis have also been noted to occur in patients using PPD.  To
minimize the risk of an allergic reaction to hair dye, individuals should follow the manufacturer's   instructions, perform a patch test, and avoid over-processing the hair. Treatment for PPD-induced contact dermatitis may include topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, and in severe cases,
oral corticosteroids.
other options:
option A: Pollen is not typically found in hair dyes and is not responsible for this condition.
Pollen allergies usually present as hay fever or seasonal allergic rhinitis.
option B: chromates, which can be found in cement, leather, and paints, are not typically present in hair dyes and are not responsible for this skin reaction.
option c: Balsam of Peru, a fragrant resin, is found in various cosmetic and food products but is not a common component of hair dyes. It is less likely to be responsible for this condition
compared to PPD.",3695-2369.PNG,D,
Q2,A female patient presented with acne that is not resolving on oral isotretinoin and antibiotics therapy. which of the following is the next best investigation?,"a)Look for dietary triggers
b)Evaluate for hyperandrogenism
c)check for antibiotic resistance
d)Look for drug triggers","The next best step for a female patient with acne that is resistant to oral isotretinoin is to check for hyperandrogenism.
Hyperandrogenism usually manifests as hirsutism, acne, and/or androgenic alopecia. Acne that is persistent, moderate to severe, or late-onset raises concern for Pcos or other causes of
hyperandrogenism.



The pathogenesis of acne vulgaris involves
• Blockage of the follicular opening by hyperkeratosis
• sebum overproduction
• The proliferation of commensal propionibacterium acnes
• Inflammation
Management is directed at minimizing inflammation, decreasing keratin production, antibiotics, and antiandrogens to diminish sebum production.
other options:
option A: Looking for dietary triggers could be considered, but there is limited evidence to support a direct relationship between specific food items and acne.
option C: since the patient has not shown improvement even with antibiotic therapy, it is reasonable to consider checking for antibiotic resistance. However, evaluating for
hyperandrogenism should be prioritized due to its potential role in the patient's condition.
option D: Looking for drug triggers may be relevant in some cases, but it is less likely to be the primary cause of acne that is not responding to isotretinoin and antibiotics. Drug-induced acne typically resolves once the offending drug is discontinued.",,B,
Q3,"A young woman presents with complaints of a painless ulcer in the genital area. It is
associated with non-tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)chancroid
b)syphilis
c)Herpes genitalis
d)Granuloma inguinale","The given clinical scenario of a painless ulcer and non-tender lymphadenopathy is suggestive of primary syphilis.
The incubation period of syphilis is 9-9o days and varies inversely with the size of the spirochaete inoculum.
stages of syphilis:
• primary chancre: painless, indurated, button-like ulcer with painless lymphadenopathy.
• secondary syphilis is the stage when generalized manifestations of syphilis appear on
the skin and mucous membranes. A macular rash is commonly seen and this stage may be preceded by constitutional symptoms such as fever, sore throat, and malaise.
• Latent syphilis is the stage when there are no clinical features of the active disease but serological testing for the disease is positive.
• Late syphilis (tertiary syphilis) commonly presents as superficial or nodular punched-out
ulcers or gummas (granulomas appearing as cutaneous plaques or nodules with central
ulceration) that appears 3-1o years after infection. It may also present as red nodules (nodular syphilides), neurosyphilis, and cardiovascular syphilis.
serological testing is done using standard non-treponemal antibody tests like VDRL and rapid plasma reagin (RpR). specific treponemal antibody tests like Treponema pallidum
hemagglutination assay (TpHA) and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test
(FTA-ABs) are further required. Microscopically, T. palladium is identified with characteristic corkscrew morphology and motility on darkfield microscopy.



parenteral penicillin G is the drug of choice for all stages of syphilis. Treatment of recent sexual contacts is recommended.
other options:
option A: Chancroid presents with a painful genital ulcer and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. It is caused by the bacterium Haemophilus ducreyi.
option C: Herpes genitalis is characterized by painful vesicular lesions that progress to ulcers in     the genital region, caused by the herpes simplex virus (HsV). It is usually associated with localized tender lymphadenopathy.
option D: Granuloma inguinale (also known as donovanosis) is caused by the bacterium klebsiella granulomatis. It presents as a slowly progressive, painless, beefy-red ulcerative lesion in the
genital region, often without lymphadenopathy.",,B,
Q4,which of the following is associated with the clinical condition shown in the image?,"a)cataract
b)Glaucoma
c)Malignant melanoma
d)Basal cell carcinoma","The given image showing a black, heterogeneous, hairy palpable lesion in a child is suggestive of congenital melanocytic nevus. Malignant melanoma is more commonly associated with a
congenital melanocytic nevus.
Congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) are benign, pigmented, melanocytic nevi present at birth.
They are most commonly brown, black, purplish, or red, usually a palpable lesion with
heterogeneous color and texture. CMN often have thick hair at birth, which grows at a
significantly greater rate than the surrounding scalp hair.
Congenital melanocytic nevi can be classified based on size: small (&lt;1.5 cm), medium (1.5-19.9 cm), and large or giant (&gt;2o cm). Larger CMN have a higher risk of developing malignant
melanoma. Management of CMN depends on the size and location of the lesion. smaller nevi may be observed, while larger nevi or those at a higher risk for complications may require surgical
excision, particularly if there is a concern for malignant transformation. Complications of CMN include neurological abnormalities (intraparenchymal melanosis is the commonest
finding), malignant melanoma, and other tumors like rhabdomyosarcoma.
The lifetime risk of malignant transformation in large or giant CMN ranges from 5% to 1o%.
Regular follow-up and monitoring for changes in size, color, or texture are essential for early detection of potential complications.
Note: More than 5o% of patients with sturge-weber syndrome have glaucoma as an ocular   complication. The image given below shows port-wine staining in a child with sturge-weber syndrome.",3696-2370.PNG,C,3700-2371.PNG
