Q5,which of the following is not a feature of cocaine intoxication?,"a)Tingling and numbness of hands and feet
b)constricted pupils and bradycardia
c)Hypertension
d)Hyperthermia","constricted pupils and bradycardia are not a feature of cocaine intoxication. Dilated pupils and rapid pulse are seen in cocaine intoxication.
cocaine is obtained from the leaves of Erythroxylum coca. cocaine can be
administered by snorting, intravenous route, or smoking.
The manifestations of cocaine intoxication occur in two stages- the stage of excitement and the stage of depression.
In the stage of excitement, the features seen are dry mouth, dysphagia, tachycardia, tachypnea,
hypertension, dilated pupils, and increased temperature. There may be a feeling of well-being, and the patient may be excited, restless, and talkative. This progresses into a calm, dull
state. Neurological manifestations include exaggerated reflexes, tremors or convulsions,
hallucinations, tingling, and numbness in the hands and feet.
The stage of depression is characterized by feeble respiration, excessive sweating, collapse, convulsions, and death.
The fatal dose of cocaine is 1g when taken orally. The fatal period ranges from a few minutes to hours.
chronic cocaine users may have the feeling of insects crawling on their skin or the presence of
grains of sand under the skin. This is known as cocaine bugs or Magnan's symptom. ulceration of the nasal septum may be seen in chronic abusers who sniff cocaine.
Treatment includes gastric lavage with warm water containing potassium permanganate,
charcoal, or tannic acid if taken orally. when it is through the nose or throat, a wash with water is done. In case of intravenous intoxication, a ligature is applied above the site of the injection.

Q8,poisoning with which of the following agents would cause hypertension?,"a)organophosphorus
b)paracetamol
c)Arsenic
d)cocaine","poisoning with cocaine cause hypertension. This is due to the inhibition of norepinephrine at the adrenergic terminals leading to increased sympathetic stimulation. This effect occurs at all
concentrations of cocaine and causes hypertension and ventricular ectopics.
cocaine is obtained from the plant Erythroxylum coca. The symptoms of cocaine poisoning are divided into two stages:
• stage of excitement: This stage is characterized by features like dysphagia, dryness in the mouth, tachycardia, and dilated pupils. The reflexes are exaggerated and are associated with tingling and



numbness in the hands and feet.
• stage of depression: This stage presents with feeble respiration, profuse sweating, convulsions, and death. In most cases, the cause of death is cardiopulmonary failure or vascular collapse.
chronic users develop a feeling of insects crawling through the skin or the presence of grains of  sand under the skin. This is pathognomic for cocaine poisoning and is known as cocaine bugs or Magnan's symptoms. ulceration and sometimes perforation of the nasal septum are seen in
chronic abusers due to the sniffing habit.
The image of the nasal septum of a chronic abuser is shown below:

Anticholinergic symptoms include tachycardia, hypertension, flushing, dry mouth, mydriasis, and urinary retention.






other options:
option A: Aconite is a cardiac poison derived mainly from the root and root tubers of the
plant Aconitum napellus (shown below). symptoms of intoxication are due to action on the
voltage-gated sodium channels on the cell membrane of nerves and skeletal and smooth muscles. symptoms include intestinal (nausea, vomiting, perioral tingling and numbness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), cardiovascular (chest pain, palpitations, hypotension, bradycardia), and
neurological (vertigo and restlessness) manifestations.

option C: Nicotine is a plant alkaloid derived from the Nicotiana tabacum plant, shown in the image below. It is a cardiac poison.
All components of this plant are poisonous except its ripe seeds. It is a cardiac poison that initially stimulates the autonomic ganglia to produce symptoms of acute intoxication (tachycardia,
hypotension, tachypnea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and headache). These symptoms later subside to give way to respiratory depression and collapse.",,D,2808-1705.PNG;2809-1707.PNG;2809-1706.PNG;2810-1708.PNG
Q12,The image given below is a type of________.,"a)Contusion
b)Abrasion
c)Laceration
d)stab wound","The type of injury shown in the image is a contusion.
A contusion is characterized by the infiltration of extravasated blood into the subcutaneous and/or subepithelial tissues. It results from the rupture of small blood vessels due to the application
of blunt force.
• A pure bruise lies beneath an intact epidermis.
• Bruises are caused by damage to veins, venules, and small arteries.
• The usual bruise from a blunt impact is situated in the subcutaneous tissues, often in the fat
layer. (Because of the greater volume of soft subcutaneous tissue in fat people, they tend to bruise more easily than thin ones).
• Delayed bruising - It is common knowledge among lay persons, as well as doctors, that a bruise  may ‘come out’ - that is, become more prominent with the passage of hours or days. This is partly caused by continued bleeding from the ruptured vessels, but mainly by the percolation of free
blood from its origin deeper in the tissues upwards towards the epidermis.
other options:
option B: Abrasion, also known as gravel rash, is the destruction of superficial layers of the
epidermis. It is caused by friction against a rough surface or by compression. It is of four types:
• scratches



• Grazes
• pressure abrasions
• Impact abrasions
option C: Laceration refers to a tear or split of the skin, mucous membranes, muscle, or internal  organs. It is due to the application of blunt force to a broad area of the body. They are also called tears or ruptures. The laceration may indicate the cause of the injury and the shape of the blunt   weapon. The age of the injury can also be determined.
option D: A stab wound is formed when force is delivered along the long axis of a narrow or
pointed object. The object can be a knife, sword, chisel, scissors, or needle. It is deeper than its length and width on the surface of the skin. The edges are clean-cut and inverted.",2791-1690.PNG,A,

The active ingredients of Datura include the anticholinergic alkaloids atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine. The seeds or other parts of the plant can be ingested or smoked.
Manifestations of Datura toxicity:
• Dry hot skin (Temperature rises up to 42 C, a scarlet rash may also be appreciated).
• Dilatation of pupils along with loss of accommodation
• Diplopia
• Dryness of the mouth and throat, unquenchable thirst
• Dysphagia
• Dilatation of cutaneous blood vessels
• Dysarthria (Difficulty in talking)
• Drunken gait
• Delirium
• Drowsiness
• Death due to respiratory or cardiac failure
Morphine, codeine, and thebaine are natural opioids derived from poppy papaver somniferum.  Abrin is a toxalbumin of the plant Abrus precatorius, and it acts by inhibiting protein synthesis. Toxic principles ofAbrus precatorius:



• Abrin (a toxalbumen)
• Abrine (an amino acid)
• Abralin (a glucoside)
Abrin acts by inhibiting protein synthesis, thereby, resulting in cell death. The clinical features
after oral ingestion of these seeds include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, and miosis. Faintness, dyspnea, and convulsions can also occur.
The poison obtained from strychnos nux-vomica seeds is strychnine. strychnine acts at
the ventral horn by blocking the postganglionic glycine receptor sites in the spinal
cord and brainstem. Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that acts at the postsynaptic     membranes of ventral horn motor neurons. Hence, the blockade of these receptors results in unopposed muscle contraction, resulting in the classical clinical features:
• Tonic-clonic seizures
• opisthotonus (body arched in hyperextension)
• Risus sardonicus",,B,
Q15,"The dead body of a child was recovered from a river with froth around his mouth, which reappeared even after wiping it off. which postmortem finding is not seen in this case?","a)voluminous and ballooned out lungs
b)High concentration of arsenic from shaft of hair
c)paltauf's hemorrhage in sub pleura
d)cadaveric spasm with mud in closed fist","The above case scenario with frothing is suggestive of antemortem drowning. High concentration of arsenic in the shaft of hair is seen in patients with chronic arsenic poisoning.
Given below are the features of antemortem drowning.
• Froth - The presence of copious amounts of fine, shaving-lather-like froth at the mouth and the nostrils is the most characteristic finding of antemortem drowning. It is caused by the vigorous    agitation of the tracheal and bronchial mucous secretions, edema fluid, and alveolar surfactant    during respiratory efforts.
• cutis anserina - The contraction of the erector pilorum muscles causes puckering and a grainy appearance of the skin. This resembles goose skin; hence, it is called cutis anserina.
• washerwoman’s hand - Maceration of the skin on the palms and soles gives a wrinkled, sodden, and bleached appearance due to submersion.
• cadaveric spasm - Gravel, weed, soil, grass, etc. is firmly held in the clenched hands due to   cadaveric spasm. This is a vital sign of antemortem drowning. The material also indicates the place of submersion.
• Rigor mortis - This appears early in cases of a violent antemortem struggle.
• Face - It is bloated and discolored, with cyanosis.
• Eyes - conjunctiva are suffused and pupils dilated.
• Tongue - It may be swollen and protruded.
• Antemortem injuries - These may be sustained by striking objects, such as rocks, during the fall into the water body. Examination for such injuries must be performed only after the body is dry.
Internal findings:



• Lungs - They appear voluminous and distended show ballooning. The cut section will exude copious amounts of frothy, bloodstained fluid.
• Larynx, trachea, and bronchioles - The presence of sand, silt, and aquatic vegetation in the trachea and lower respiratory tract are characteristic findings of antemortem drowning.
• Heart and blood vessels- Gettler test can be done to estimate the chloride content in the right and left sides of the heart to differentiate between freshwater and saltwater drowning.
• Diatom test- Diatoms are microscopic algae. Their presence in the organs, particularly in the bone marrow, is suggestive of antemortem drowning.
• stomach and small intestines- These organs may contain water in some cases. water present in the small intestine is positive evidence of death by drowning.
• Middle ear - The presence of water in the middle ear is highly suggestive of antemortem drowning.
• Brain - It is congested, and edematous, with loss of gray-white junction.",2792-1691.PNG,B,
Q16,spanish windlass is a type of which strangulation method?,"a)Bansdola
b)Garrotting
c)Mugging
d)Throttling","spanish windlass is an improvised version of garrotting, and it involves tightening an iron collar (spanish windlass) around the neck and forcing a spike against the neck into the spinal cord.
This was a form of judicial execution once employed in spain. The rod-like object used to tighten the ligature is called a spanish windlass; this may be a ruler, stick, or screwdriver.
Garrotting involves attacking the victim from behind using a ligature. The ligature is thrown over the victim’s neck and then tightened by twisting with a lever.
The image given below shows garrotting.


option A: squeezing to death using sticks is called bansdola. The neck or the chest is squeezed  between two sticks, one placed in front, and one behind. The neck may also be squeezed with a



single stick in front if the victim is lying down.
option C: squeezing the neck with the arm and forearm is called mugging. The image below shows mugging.


option D: Throttling or manual strangulation occurs due to compression of the neck by humans leading to asphyxia. Thumb impression and finger marks may be seen over the victim's neck.",,B,2814-1709.PNG;2815-1710.PNG

Q18,"A lady underwent cholecystectomy and now she presents with abdominal pain, one month
later. An erect abdomen x-ray was taken, and the image is given below. The following offense comes under _______.","a)Novus actus interveniens
b)Res ipsa loquitur
c)Res judicata
d)Respondeat superior","The x-ray shows a pair of surgical scissors left behind in the abdomen after surgery. The offense comes under res ipsa loquitur. It is obvious evidence of the negligent act committed.
""Res ipsa loquitur"" means ""the thing or fact speaks for itself."" The negligent act is so obvious that the patient need not prove the negligence. He has to merely state what according to him was the  negligent act.



This doctrine applies to both civil and criminal negligence. All of the following conditions should be fulfilled for this doctrine:
• In the absence of negligence, there would not have been any injury usually
• The doctor had complete control over the injury-producing instrument or treatment.
• The patient was not a part of contributory negligence.
other options:
option A: Novus actus interveniens: A person is responsible not only for his actions but also for    the logical consequences of those actions. This principle applies to cases of assault and accidental injury.
option C: Res judicata (Section 337, BNSS) -If a question of negligence against a doctor has
already been decided by a court in a dispute between the doctor and his patient, the patient will not be allowed to contest the same in another legal proceeding, based on the same set of facts.   Multiple appeals cannot be made.
option D: The principle of respondeat superior is used to explain vicarious liability, which
explains that the employer is responsible for his employees’ negligence if such an act occurs in the course of the employment and within its scope.",2793-1692.PNG,B,
Q19,Tattooing around the entry wound of a bullet is due to?,"a)unburnt particles
b)smoke
c)Flame
d)Muzzle impression","Tattooing around the entry wound of a bullet is due to the deposition of unburnt powder particles. These are difficult to remove. They are also called stippling or peppering. This is seen up to 5o cm of firing
when the distance between the firing and the victim is between 3o-5o cm (in the case of pistols and revolvers), it is a near-shot wound. The victim is within the range of powder deposition, so
there is some amount of tattooing present. But it is outside the range of flame, so there will not be any burning or singeing. There will not be any blackening, as it is outside the range of smoke as
well.
The injuries related to firearms are:
• Burn injuries - occur due to flame released during the firing. It is seen in contact shot wounds or distances up to 5-8 cm. Singeing of hair is caused due to burns
• Blackening - occurs due to the deposit of smoke. It can be removed with a wet cloth. This can be seen up to around 15 cm of firing
• Tattooing - occurs due to the deposition of unburnt powder particles. These are difficult to remove. They are also called stippling or peppering. This is seen up to 5o cm of firing
• Greasing and collaring - occur due to the deposition of the lubricant of the bullet in the tissues, during its penetration. It can be found in contact, near-shot, or distant shot wounds.
In a firm contact shot, the imprint of the muzzle of the gun is seen on the skin around the wound. The victim is within the range of flame, hence singeing of the hair will be present. Tattooing
begins only when the muzzle-to-target distance is &gt;1cm, like in a loose contact shot.



when the distance between the victim and the firing is 5-8cm, it is called a close shot. The victim is within the range of the flame, hence, features related to flame, smoke, and powder deposition   will be seen. singeing, burning, blackening and tattooing will be present.
when the distance between the victim and the firing is &gt;5o cm, it is a distant shot. The victim lies outside the range of flame and powder deposition. Hence, features related to flame, smoke,   and powder deposition are absent. Burning, blackening, and tattooing are absent.",,A,
Q20,pick the mechanism of cold water drowning.,"a)Asphyxia
b)Laryngeal spasm
c)vagal inhibition
d)cardiac arrest","In cold water drowning or immersion syndrome or hydrocution, death occurs due to vagal inhibition, leading to cardiac arrest.
Hydrocution/ immersion syndrome refers to sudden death, following immersion in cold water. Death results from vagal inhibition of the heart, i.e. cardiac arrest occurring due to increased    stimulation of the vagus nerve.
vagus stimulation occurs due to the following mechanisms:
• sudden entry of water into the nasopharynx or larynx
• Falling or diving into the water in a manner, so that it suddenly strikes the abdomen, especially the epigastric region
• sudden in-rush of cold water into the ears Types of drowning:
• wet drowning/ typical drowning
• Atypical drowning/dry drowning
• Immersion syndrome/ hydrocution
• post-immersion syndrome/ secondary drowning/ near-drowning
• submersion of the unconscious/ shallow-water drowning",,C,
Q21,Identify the pattern of abrasion shown in the image below.,"a)Ligature mark
b)Graze abrasion
c)pressure abrasion
d)Imprint abrasion","The given image shows an abrasion due to ligature mark, which is a pressure abrasion.
Abrasions are superficial wounds produced due to injury to the epidermis. They are usually caused by friction against a rough surface or by compression.
Types of abrasions:
• Linear abrasions (scratches): caused by relative movement of a pointed object on the skin
• Examples: nail, thorn, the point of sword or knife
• Grazed abrasions (sliding /scrapping/grinding abrasion): caused by relative movement of a rough surface on a wide area of skin
• brush burns- tangential rubbing over the surface, usually the ground



• friction burns are extensive excoriated areas without bleeding
• Examples: fall, a victim being dragged on the ground, road traffic accidents
• Imprint abrasions (patterned abrasions): caused by the impact of a rigid hard rough surface over a localized area of the skin without any movement; usually show the pattern of the object causing   them
• Examples: tire, grills, bicycle chain, bite marks
• pressure abrasions (pressure abrasion): caused by crushing of the superficial layers of the epidermis
• Examples: ligature marks around the neck in hanging",2794-1693.PNG,C,

• Large blebs containing a red serous or serosanguineous fluid appear at around 24 hours
• serous cavities may contain a turbid reddish fluid after 48 hours
• spalding's sign (option B) radiographic finding is seen as
a loss of alignment and over-riding of bones of the cranial vault. This occurs due to shrinkage of the brain after death. It is seen 7 days after fetal death.
• A sweetish and disagreeable odor
• sodden and coppery red/purplish skin (never greenish as with putrefaction) with blisters, and cuticle peeling. The skin detaches easily and leaves moist and greasy areas
• Distended abdomen and thick, red, and soft umbilical cord
• Abnormally mobile or flexible joints
• soft, edematous, and loss of morphology of the organs or viscera (lungs and uterus remain unaffected for long period)
• The body is soft and pliable and flattens out when placed on an even surface
option c: Ball sign is hyperflexion of the spine with crowding of ribs seen in intrauterine death.
option D: Halo sign is a radiological sign of intrauterine fetal death showing an increase in soft tissue width between subcutaneous fat and the cranial vault.",,A,
Q23,"A man was brought to the emergency department with a history of assault by a mob using   heavy blunt objects and sharp objects. on examination, crushing of the hair bulb was seen. Identify the type of wound.","a)clean cut incised wound
b)Lacerated wound
c)chop wound
d)Avulsion injury","The type of wound in which the crushing of the hair bulb is seen is a lacerated wound.
cut lacerations may be produced by blunt weapons or heavy relatively sharp-edged weapons such as axe, hatchets, and choppers. scalp lacerations can be found in association with bruising and
abrasions. Fascial strands, hair bulbs, nerves, and vessels, that run in the depth of the wound, are irregularly torn and crushed.
Margins are irregular, ragged, and uneven. The ends are pointed or blunt. The edges of
lacerations, especially over the skull are undermined. The depth of the wound varies according to the thickness of the soft parts at the site of the injury and the degree of force applied.
Medicolegal importance of laceration:
• The type of laceration indicates the cause of the injury and the shape of the weapon.
• Foreign bodies found in the wound may indicate the circumstances in which the crime was committed.
• The age of the injury can be determined.
The image below shows a lacerated wound.


other options
option A: An incised wound is clean-cut, regular, and well-defined. Bruising does not occur when  caused by light-cutting weapons but bruising and some irregularity of the margins may be present when heavy and not-so-sharp-edged weapons like a shovel, kassi, axe, tangi, etc. have been used.





option c: chop wounds are caused by a blow with the sharp cutting edge of a fairly heavy weapon like an axe, sword, or hatchet. The margins ofthe wound depending on the condition of the
weapon, a sharp margin with slight bruising is seen with a sharp-edged weapon, and a ragged and bruised margin is seen with a blunt edge. undermining occurs in the direction towards which the  chop is made.


option D: Avulsion or shearing laceration is a lesion where the skin separates or peels off by tearing from the underlying tissues. It is due to shearing force delivered at an acute angle.

Q24,Identify the postmortem change given in the image.,"a)Marbling
b)Tattooing
c)Lividity
d)Filigree burns","The postmortem change shown above is marbling, which is an external sign of putrefaction.



In marbling, the superficial veins of roots of the limb, thighs, sides of the abdomen, and shoulders are stained greenish-brown or purplish-red, in a linear branching pattern. It is usually
prominent 36–48 hours after death occurs due to the formation of sulfhemoglobin subsequent to hemolysis of red blood cells.
In putrefaction, bacteria from the gut enter into and multiply in the surrounding
tissues, eventually spreading through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. The
bacterium clostridium welchii is largely responsible for the putrefactive changes spreading   through the body, due to its production of the enzyme lecithinase. The first external sign of  putrefaction in a body lying outside in the air is a greenish discoloration of the skin over the region of the cecum.
other options:
option B: Tattooing around the entry wound of a bullet is due to the deposition of unburnt
powder particles. These are difficult to remove. They are also called stippling or peppering. This is seen up to 5o cm of firing
option c: postmortem hypostasis/postmortem staining/postmortem lividity/Livor
mortis/suggilation refers to bluish-purple or reddish-purple discoloration of the superficial layers of the dermis. It is an early postmortem change that occurs due to the stagnation of blood in
the vessels of the dependent parts due to the effect of gravity.
option D: Filigree burns also known as Lichtenberg's flowers are superficial, thin, irregular, and tortuous markings on the skin indicative of a lightning strike. They resemble the branches of a    tree and are usually found over the skin of the shoulders or the flanks.",2703-1648.PNG,A,
Q25,A male patient working in the matchbox industry for the past 2o years reports to the dentist  with multiple sinuses and fistulae in and around his jaw with foul-smelling discharge. which of the following chemicals are responsible for this?,"a)Bromine
b)Antimony
c)Fluorine
d)phosphorus","The clinical scenario is suggestive of a phossy jaw, which occurs due to chronic phosphorus  poisoning. phossy jaw refers to osteomyelitis and necrosis of the jaw, with foul-smelling pus discharging multiple sinuses.
Frequent inhalation of phosphorus fumes causes necrosis of the lower jaw in the region of a
decayed tooth. patients initially present with toothache, followed by swelling of the jaw, loosening of the teeth, necrosis of gums, and sequestration of the bone in the mandible producing
considerable facial disfigurement.
chronic phosphorus poisoning is common among the workers of phosphorus industries
(matchbox factories), who have had chronic exposure to phosphorus fumes for months to years. It is managed surgically and by prevention of further exposure to the poison.
phosphorus is a non-metallic, inorganic irritant poison that affects cellular oxidation. It exists in two forms, white phosphorus, a highly toxic form, and red phosphorus, the non-toxic form.
Fulminant poisoning is seen when more than one gram is consumed, and death occurs within 12   hours due to peripheral vascular collapse. In acute poisoning, they present with pain in the throat and abdomen, with intense thirst, nausea, diarrhea, and severe abdominal pain. system toxicity    occurs after 2–3 days and results in hematemesis, enlarged tender liver, jaundice, pruritus, and
hemorrhages. The gastric and intestinal content have garlic odor and are luminous.



Gastric lavage with potassium permanganate oxidizes phosphorus into phosphoric acid and phosphates. Activated charcoal can be used to adsorb the poison.
other options:
option A: Bromine is a corrosive substance that causes necrosis of skin and tissues.
option B: The symptoms of antimony poisoning, both acute and chronic are similar to that of
arsenic. Inhalation of fumes causes a flu-like illness called metal fume fever. In cases of chronic    poisoning with heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, mercury, antimony, copper, etc., the shaft of a long bone, strands of scalp hair, fingernails or toenails, and a wedge of the quadriceps muscle
should be taken for sampling.
option c: Prolonged ingestion of fluorides results in the mottling of teeth, an increase in the
density of bones, lipping of bony margins of vertebrae, which sometimes produce pressure on the spinal cord leading to paraplegia.",,D,
Q26,which of the following rules of law are associated with insanity?,"a)1, 2, 3 and 4
b)2, 3, 4 only
c)1, 2 only
d)3, 4 only","Durham's rule and curren's rule are laws associated with insanity.
Durhams's rule states that an accused person is not criminally responsible if his unlawful act is the product of mental disease or mental defect.
curren’s rule states that an accused person is not criminally responsible if, at the time of
committing the act, he did not have the capacity to regulate his conduct to the requirements of the law as a result of mental disease or defect.
In India, the law of criminal responsibility is under BNS Section 22 (Section 84 IPc) It states that ""Nothing is an offense which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of
unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or what he is doing is either    wrong or contrary to the law”. This is slightly different from McNaghten's rule followed in Britain.
M'Naghten's rule states that every man is to be presumed to be sane, and possesses a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes until the contrary is proved.
other rules to assess the criminal responsibility of insane persons:
• The Irresistible Impulse
• Federal rule or American Law Institute test (ALT)
• The Brawner rule
Note: Ashley's rule is used to differentiate males and females based on the combined length of the manubrium and sternum. It is considered to be a male sternum when the combined length is
&gt;149 mm, while if the combined length is &lt;149 mm, then it is considered female.",,C,
Q27,The steps in the management of snake bite include:,"a)1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
b)1, 2, and 4
c)4 only
d)4 and 5","The management of snakebites includes immobilization and administration of anti-snake venom (ASV) after hospitalization.



Immobilization is done to minimize the spread of the venom. Hospitalization, followed by AsV administration is the definitive management of snake bites.
Measures that can be taken in the case of snakebite:
• Apply firm pressure over the bitten area, which delays the absorption of venom
• pressure immobilization is recommended for elapid and sea-snake bites, but not for viper bites as it may cause local necrosis
• Immediately apply a broad firm bandage (sutherland wrap) on the bitten area and around the   limb. As much of the limb should be bandaged as possible. It should be tight enough to occlude   the superficial venous and lymphatic return, but not the arterial or deep venous flow. A pressure of 5o to 7o mm Hg is maintained.
• In bites on the trunk, head, or neck, apply firm pressure over the bitten area
• Immobilize the limb, as movement can accelerate the spread of venom
• Make the patient lie on one side in the recovery position so that the airway is clear, in case of vomiting or fainting.
Measures contraindicated in the case of snakebite:
• suction and incision of the wound
• Electric shock treatment of wound site
• Application of tourniquets because they obstruct arterial flow and cause ischemia
• Ice water immersion of the bitten limb
• Do not attempt to kill or catch the snake as it may be dangerous.
• Administration of AsV locally at the wound site.
• Herbal/local remedies",,D,
Q28,Hooch tragedy is related to:,"a)phosphorus
b)Mercury
c)Ethanol
d)Methanol","Hooch tragedy is due to the consumption of cheap illicit liquor containing methanol, particularly by the lower socio-economic classes.
The central organ for metabolism is the liver. Methanol or methyl alcohol is first oxidized to
formaldehyde with the help of alcohol dehydrogenase. It is further metabolized to formic acid via  aldehyde dehydrogenase. These metabolites are responsible for the adverse effects of intoxication.
Features seen are ophthalmological complications such as blindness, and optic neuropathy. Brain edema, acute renal failure, and severe metabolic derangement are also seen.",,D,
