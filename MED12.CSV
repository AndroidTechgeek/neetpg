Q1,Identify the condition associated with the murmur depicted in the image below.,"a)Mitral regurgitation
b)Aortic regurgitation
c)Aortic stenosis
d)Mitral stenosis","The given image shows pansystolic murmur, and it is associated with mitral regurgitation.
Mitral regurgitation may result from an abnormality or disease process that affects functional components of the mitral valve apparatus.
causes of mitral regurgitation include
• Acute: Blunt trauma, papillary muscle rupture, infective endocarditis
• chronic: Mitral valve prolapse, rheumatic fever, healed infective endocarditis, ischemic cardiomyopathy, HocM, etc.
A pansystolic murmur of at least grade III/VI intensity can be auscultated in chronic severe mitral regurgitation. It is heard best at the apex and radiates to the axilla. Ruptured chordae tendineae    may produce a murmur with a cooing or “seagull” quality, whereas a flail leaflet may produce a
murmur with a musical quality.
S1 is generally absent or soft. wide splitting of S2 may occur due to premature closure of the
aortic valve. A low-pitched third heart sound (S3) may occur following A2. S4 can also be audible in patients with acute severe MR.
The image below depicts the pansystolic murmur in mitral regurgitation.


other options:
option B: An early diastolic murmur can be auscultated in chronic aortic regurgitation. It is
high-pitched and blowing in character. It is best heard in the third intercostal space along the left sternal edge. It may be accompanied by a mid-systolic ejection murmur in isolated AR or the
Austin Flint murmur in severe AR. The latter is a soft, low-pitched, rumbling, mid-to-late diastolic murmur produced by the displacement of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve by the AR stream.
A2 is usually absent, and occasionally, S4 also may be heard.





option C:  In aortic stenosis, an ejection mid-systolic murmur can be auscultated. It begins after the first heart sound (s1), increases in intensity toward the middle of the ejection, and ends just  before aortic valve closure. It is low-pitched, rough, and rasping in character. It is best heard at   the base of the heart, most commonly in the second right intercostal space.
A systolic ejection click can be heard in young patients with a bicuspid aortic valve, but disappears as the valves become calcified. A2 and P2 may be heard at the same time, or A2 may follow P2,
resulting in the paradoxical splitting of the second heart sound (s2). The fourth heart sound (s4) is often heard at the apex, indicating the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy.


option D: In mitral stenosis, a diastolic murmur can be heard during auscultation.",4457-2809.PNG,A,4465-2814.PNG;4466-2816.PNG;4466-2815.PNG;4467-2817.PNG
Q2,"A young man came to the medical OPD with complaints of early morning backache and stiffness, which improves on exercise, and persistent red eyes. On examination, lung
expansion was less than 3 cm. X-ray is shown in the image given below. what is the most probable diagnosis?","a)Ankylosing spondylitis
b)paget's disease
c)Healed tuberculosis
d)osteopetrosis","The given clinical vignette points towards the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis.
Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the spine and sacroiliac joint. It is more common in young males and has a strong association with HLAB27.
clinically, patients present with recurring backache which worsens in the early
morning or with inactivity and improves with exercise. Later, they develop fatigue, pain, joint swellings, and heel pain. Extra-articular manifestations include anterior uveitis, aortic
incompetence, carditis, and apical lobe fibrosis. Examination findings include loss of lumbar lordosis, increased thoracic kyphosis, diminished spinal movements, and decreased chest
expansion.
X-ray findings:
• Erosion of sacroiliac joints - earliest sign
• periarticular sclerosis in later stages
• squaring of vertebrae due to the flattening of normal anterior concavity of the vertebral body is the earliest vertebral change
• Bamboo spine appearance due to bridging of adjacent vertebrae
• wedging of the vertebra, leading to hyperkyphosis
complications of ankylosing spondylitis include
• spinal fractures, the most common site is c5–7
• Hyperkyphosis
• spinal cord compression
• Lumbosacral nerve root compression



Treatment consists of maintaining posture and preserving mobility. pain and stiffness can be
controlled with anti-inflammatory drugs. In severe cases, TNF inhibitors are used. Surgery can be considered to correct the deformity.

Q3,"A patient with hyperkalemia and elevated urea levels underwent dialysis. Towards the end of the session, she became drowsy and had a sudden seizure episode. on examination, the
patient was hypotensive. what is the treatment for this condition?","a)Bumetanide
b)Ethacrynic acid
c)Nesiritide
d)IV Mannitol","The given scenario is suggestive of the dialysis disequilibrium syndrome (DDS) or the reverse urea effect. It is an acute complication that occurs especially in patients undergoing dialysis for the first time.
During dialysis, urea in blood vessels is rapidly removed as compared to that in the interstitium.  This decreases the osmolality of blood. This results in a fluid shift from the blood vessels into the interstitium and brain parenchyma, causing cerebral edema.



DDS can present as headache, nausea, blurred vision, restlessness, confusion, and severe manifestations like coma and seizures in rare cases.
The most common risk factors include
• First hemodialysis treatment
• High blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (above 175 mg/dL or 6o mmol/L) before initiation of dialysis
• children and elderly
• Sudden change in dialysis regimen
• Hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy
• Sepsis, meningitis, encephalitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, vasculitis
•
History of stroke, malignant hypertension, head trauma, or seizure disorder
Management includes changing the sodium dialysate bath or engaging the changed prescription on the dialysis machine. Intravenous mannitol can be used to reduce intracerebral pressure in    severe symptoms of DDS.
DDS can be prevented by
• Slow and gentle initial hemodialysis
• Limiting the clearance of urea to prevent the development of an osmotic gradient
• Increasing dialysate sodium level
• Administration of osmotically active substance",,D,
Q4,"A female patient presents with severe restlessness, palpitations, and tremors to the
emergency department. she is a known case of bronchial asthma. on examination, the neck looks swollen. Blood pressure is elevated, and tachycardia is noted. ECG shows atrial
fibrillation. which of the following drugs is used for immediate management in this patient?","a)Diltiazem
b)propranolol
c)Esmolol
d)propylthiouracil","The given clinical scenario suggests the diagnosis of thyroid storm/thyroid crisis presenting with    atrial fibrillation, and the immediate management in this patient is to rate control the arrhythmia with diltiazem (calcium channel blocker).
Thyroid storm/Thyrotoxic crisis is a rare but severe life-threatening complication of
hyperthyroidism induced by the release of excessive thyroid hormones.
It is caused by abrupt cessation of antithyroid medications, infection, inadequately prepared hyperthyroid patient for thyroidectomy, amiodarone administration, exposure to iodinated    contrast agents, and following radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy.
Features:
• Fever and severe dehydration
• cardiovascular: circulatory collapse, palpitations, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac failure
• GI symptoms: vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice
• Neurological symptoms: Restlessness, irritability, delirium, tremor, convulsions, and coma



Treatment:
• If the patient presents with atrial fibrillation, the first step in the management is to do rate
control using beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, or amiodarone. since this patient is a known asthmatic, beta-blockers (propranolol and esmolol) are contraindicated. so, a calcium channel blocker (diltiazem) is the preferred drug for immediate management in this patient.
• supportive measures – rehydration by proper fluid therapy, tepid sponging, and cooling blankets.
• Thionamides like propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole or carbimazole can be used. PTU (option D) is the drug of choice in thyroid storm, but it is given only after controlling atrial  fibrillation.
• Lugol’s iodide is given one hour after intake of thionamides. They inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis by wolff- Chaikoff effect.
• Glucocorticoids – reduce the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 and controls the shock.
• Digoxin and cardiac monitoring are crucial.
other options:
options B &amp; C: Beta-blockers like propranolol and esmolol are contraindicated in bronchial asthma patients.",,A,
Q5,A 3o-year-old male is found to be positive for HBsAg and HBeAg and is diagnosed with     chronic hepatitis B. The viral load of the patient was 2 x 1ooooo and SGpT is found to be doubled. what is the appropriate management in this patient?,"a)Lamivudine for 3o+ weeks
b)Tenofovir for &gt; 4o weeks
c)pegylated interferon for 52 weeks
d)combined pegylated interferon with lamivudine","The appropriate treatment for this patient based on the given clinical scenario is to administer tenofovir for more than 4o weeks.
The serological markers present in the case of chronic hepatitis B are
• HBsAg (Remains detectable beyond six months)
• Anti-HBc (Primarily of IgG class)
• HBeAg (Qualitative marker of replicative phase)
• HBV DNA (Quantitative marker of replicative phase)
Treatment of chronic hepatitis B is focused on suppressing the level of virus replication.
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is an acyclic nucleotide analog that is used as first-line
therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B. It is a potent antiretroviral agent used in the treatment of HIV infection. It is more potent in
suppressing HBV DNA and is active against both wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV. It is   given as an oral once-daily dose of 3oo mg for 48 weeks. Tenofovir therapy provided histologic   improvement, reduction in fibrosis score, and regression of cirrhosis in patients. side effects are acute renal failure and low blood phosphate levels.
other options:
option A: Lamivudine is a nucleoside analog that inhibits reverse transcriptase activity of both  HIV and HBV  and is an effective agent for chronic hepatitis B. It is given at a daily dose of 1oo mg for 48-52 weeks. It is no longer preferred.



option c: pegylated interferon is recommended as one of the first-line agents for hepatitis B. It is given as a subcutaneous injection at a dose of 18o μg/week for 48-52 weeks. It is not preferred
over oral agents because of its poor tolerability.
option D: The combination of lamivudine and pegylated interferon is found to suppress HBV
DNA more profoundly during therapy than monotherapy. However, usage of these drugs for a
year provides results similar to drugs given as monotherapy. Hence, this options is not preferred.",,B,
Q6,"A 25-year-old male patient came with complaints of palpitations, sweating, and restlessness. He has a complaint of sweaty palms. clinical findings are depicted in the image given below. what is the diagnostic finding seen in this patient?","a)Anti-thyroglobulin antibody
b)Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody
c)Thyroid receptor antibody
d)Elevated ultrasensitive thyrotropin levels","Based on the clinical findings the most likely diagnosis is Graves' disease. Elevated levels of thyroid receptor–stimulating antibodies are diagnostic of Graves' disease.
The hyperthyroidism of Graves’ disease is caused by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins
(TSI) that are synthesized in the thyroid gland as well as in bone marrow and lymph nodes. TSI    cause stimulation of the thyroid gland causing features of hyperthyroidism in the presence of low TSH levels.
clinical features of Graves' disease:
• Hyperthyroid features like hyperactivity, irritability, dysphoria, heat intolerance and sweating palpitations, fatigue, and weakness, weight loss with increased appetite, diarrhea, polyuria,
oligomenorrhea, loss of libido, tachycardia
• Eye signs as mentioned in Graves' ophthalmopathy.
• Graves ophthalmopathy: It is due to increased volume of the retroorbital connective tissues and extraocular muscles because of marked lymphocytic infiltration of the retro-orbital
space, accumulation of hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronic acid and chondroitin     sulfate, and increased numbers of adipocytes (fatty infiltration). corneal exposure, lid retraction,   lid lag on downgaze, conjunctival injection, restriction of gaze, diplopia, and visual loss from optic nerve compression are cardinal symptoms.
Histopathology shows follicular hyperplasia with scalloped margins on biopsy.
Management involves
• propylthiouracil is the mainstay of treatment for Graves' disease but it does not affect Graves' ophthalmopathy.
• Radioactive Iodine is also used as a treatment modality for hyperthyroidism in suitable patients but does not affect Grave's ophthalmopathy.
other options:
Levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase (option B) and anti-thyroglobulin (option A) are elevated in autoimmune hypothyroidism which is characterized by features of dry skin, cold intolerance,  tiredness, weakness, feeling tired, weight gain, etc.
option D: ultrasensitive thyrotropin level (TSH) is elevated in primary hypothyroidism.",4459-2811.PNG,C,
Q7,"A 5o-year-old HIV patient presented with a painful lesion, as shown in the image. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Basal cell carcinoma
b)kaposi sarcoma
c)Malignant melanoma
d)squamous cell carcinoma","The above image showing a violaceous growth on the hard palate in an HIV patient is diagnostic of Kaposi sarcoma.
Kaposi sarcoma (Ks) is a vascular neoplasm caused by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) and is very common in patients suffering from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDs). Ks is
considered to be an AIDs-defining disease.
AIDs-associated Ks is an AIDs-defining illness and is the most common malignancy associated
with HIV infection. Involvement of the oral cavity is most common in AIDs-related Ks, but it can  be seen in other variants also. oral Ks (oKs) most often involves the hard and soft palate, gingiva,
and dorsal tongue with plaques or tumors. The color of the lesions may range from non-pigmented to brownish-red or violaceous.
other forms of Ks include
• classic Kaposi sarcoma: It has the following three clinical stages patches, plaques, and nodules.
• Endemic African Ks
• Transplant-associated Ks is more common after solid organ transplant patients receive immunosuppression as compared to the marrow or stem-cell transplant patients.
The given images show coalescent red-purple macules and plaques ofthe skin and the histologic appearance of Kaposi sarcoma, demonstrating sheets of proliferating spindle cells:






There is no definitive cure but Ks is highly radiosensitive and achieves complete response in most cases. In AIDs■associated Ks, instituting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) often (but  not always) results in regression of Ks. In localized cutaneous Ks, excision and cryotherapy can be used. Intra-lesional administration of vinblastine, interferon■α2b, and imiquimod is also
effective.
other options:
option A: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) most commonly tends to occur in sun-exposed areas of the face like the nose, eyelid, and other parts of the face. BCC can vary from red, flesh-colored, or
white macules or papules, to nodules and ulcerated lesions. The nodular variant is the most common subtype characterized by raised, pearly pink papules with telangiectasias and
occasionally a depressed tumor center with raised borders giving the classic “rodent ulcer”
appearance.
The image below shows a case of basal cell carcinoma.




option c: Malignant melanoma primarily arises from melanocytes at the epidermal-dermal
junction but may also originate from mucosal surfaces of the oropharynx, nasopharynx, eyes,
proximal esophagus, anorectal, and female genitalia. Lentigo maligna, superficial spreading, acral lentiginous, and nodular are the variants of malignant melanoma. It includes pigmented lesion
that has enlarged, ulcerated, or bled. Amelanotic lesions appear as raised pink, purple, or
flesh-colored skin papules. The diagnostic clue for melanoma is the ABcDE criteria. It comprises of
• Asymmetry
• Border irregularity
• color variegation
• Diameter of more than 6 mm
• Evolution or change
The image below shows a case of malignant melanoma.


option D: Squamous cell carcinoma (Scc) is the second most common skin cancer. Uv radiation   exposure is the primary risk factor for Scc. classically, it appears as a scaly or ulcerated papule or plaque that can bleed with minimal trauma, but the pain is rare. It can exhibit in situ (confined to  the epidermis) or invasive subtypes. wide surgical excision including subcutaneous fat is the
treatment of choice for Scc.",4459-2811-1.png,B,4472-2820.PNG;4473-2821.PNG;4474-2822.PNG
Q8,"A patient is brought to the OPD by his wife complaining about difficulty in expressing
emotions and not taking part in daily activities. On examination, resting tremors and rigidity are noted. Given the possible diagnosis, which part of the brain is affected in this patient?","a)Basal ganglia
b)Hippocampus
c)cerebellum
d)Premotor cortex","Based on the clinical findings given above the most likely diagnosis is parkinson's disease and it is due to degeneration of the substantia nigra in the basal ganglia.
parkinson’s disease, also known as paralysis agitans, results from widespread degeneration of the portion of the substantia nigra that sends dopamine-secreting nerve fibers to the caudate nucleus and putamen.



It is characterized by rigidity, resting tremors, akinesia, bradykinesia, postural instability,
dysphagia, speech disorders, gait disturbances, and fatigue. other non-motor features include
anosmia, sensory disturbances, mood disorders (e.g., depression), sleep disturbances, autonomic disturbances, and cognitive impairment/dementia.
other options:
option B: Lesions of the hippocampus mainly affect learning, memory, emotional behavior, regulation of hypothalamic functions, and spatial navigation.
option c: Features of cerebellar lesions are ataxia, intention tremors, nystagmus, speech
defect (slurring speech), hypotonia or atonia, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia (failure to perform rapid alternating movements), decomposition of movement (lack of smooth flow of movement), rebound phenomenon
option D: Premotor cortex is concerned with setting posture at the start of a planned movement and with getting the individual prepared to move. It is most involved in the control of proximal   limb muscles needed to orient the body for movement.",,A,
Q9,"A 45-year-old HIV-positive male came with complaints of persistent cough and weight loss. He has skin lesions that appear as umbilicated papules and nodules predominantly on the



face, trunk, and upper extremities. Chest x-ray showed multiple bilateral nodular infiltrates. His sputum CBNAAT for tuberculosis was negative and he has a low CD4 count. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)HIV with disseminated histoplasmosis
b)HIV with disseminated cryptococcosis
c)HIV with molluscum contagiosum
d)HIV with tuberculosis","The diagnosis based on the given clinical scenario is HIV with disseminated histoplasmosis.
Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) is seen in immunocompromised patients.
common risk factors are AIDS (cD4+ T-cell count, &lt;2oo/μL), extremes of age, the
administration of immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., prednisone, mycophenolate, calcineurin
inhibitors), and use of drugs like methotrexate, anti-TNF-α agents, and other biologic response modifiers for autoimmune disorders. It most commonly involves the lungs and bone marrow.
Patients with PDH can present with diffuse interstitial or reticulonodular lung infiltrates that can cause respiratory failure, shock, coagulopathy, and multiorgan failure. clinical features are fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, and thrombocytopenia. They may also present with meningitis  or focal brain lesions, ulcerations of the oral mucosa, gastrointestinal ulcerations and bleeding,    and adrenal insufficiency.
cutaneous involvement is noted in about 1o% of cases of PDH. Skin lesions can be caused by the fungus itself resulting in the formation of papules, plaques, nodules, or ulcers, or by an immune   response to the infection causing erythema nodosum or erythema multiforme.
Laboratory investigations include looking for Histoplasma antigen in bronchoalveolar lavage     (BAL) fluid, serum, and urine, IgG and IgM antibodies in serology, a fungal culture of blood or bone marrow aspirate, and cytopathology on biopsy of the affected organ.
Histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum is a thermally dimorphic fungus. The yeast
form occurs mainly in tissues at a temperature of 37 °c and the mycelial form occurs in the soil at 25 °c. At room temperature, white, cottony, mycelial growth appears, with large (8-2o μ)
thick-walled, spherical spores with tubercles (finger-like projections called tuberculate spores). Transmission is mainly via inhalation of microconidia.
Treatment involves liposomal amphotericin B,  followed by itraconazole for at least 12 months. other options:



option B: If the disease involves skin with signs of meningitis, then HIV with disseminated
cryptococcosis can be considered. Since the patient has no signs of meningitis, this option can be ruled out.
option C: If the disease is restricted to the skin alone, it can be HIV with disseminated molluscum contagiosum. Since the question mentions lung involvement, the option is ruled out.
option D: The question mentions that CBNAAT for tuberculosis was negative. Hence, this option is ruled out.",,A,
Q10,"A male patient presented to the emergency room with seizures. He has a history of fever,
headache, and confusion. An MRI brain was done, and it showed inflammation involving the bitemporal lobe. what is the most likely etiology for this presentation?","a)Cytomegalovirus
b)Toxoplasma gondii
c)Herpes simplex virus
d)Mycobacterium tuberculosis","The given clinical vignette suggests the diagnosis of encephalitis caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV).
HSV encephalitis is defined as inflammation of brain parenchyma caused by the Herpes virus and it typically presents as an acute febrile illness.
Patients typically present with acute onset of fever, altered levels of consciousness, personality
changes, and evidence of either focal or diffuse neurologic signs and symptoms, especially in the   temporal lobe. Focal or generalized seizures occur in many patients with HSV encephalitis. other most commonly encountered focal findings include aphasia, ataxia, upper motor neuron or lower motor neuron type lesions, and cranial nerve deficits.
HSV-DNA demonstration in CSF by PCR is the investigation of choice for HSV encephalitis. other investigations that can help include CSF examination, CSF culture, serological studies, MRI, CT,    EEG, and brain biopsy.
The T2-weighted MRI of the brain will show hyperintensity in the temporal lobe in most of the patients. Bilateral involvement of the temporal lobe is more common in HSV encephalitis.
The image below is a coronal T2-weighted MR image showing a high signal intensity in the temporal lobes in a patient with HSV encephalitis.




Management includes supportive therapy(monitoring of intracranial pressure, fluid restriction, avoidance of hypotonic IV fluids), anticonvulsants for seizures, and intravenous acyclovir is
beneficial in the treatment of HSV encephalitis.
other options:
option A: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) encephalitis in adult immunocompromised adult patients often have enlarged ventricles with areas of increased T2 signal on MRI outlining the ventricles
(periventricular calcifications).
option B: In immunocompetent patients, acute toxoplasmosis is usually asymptomatic and self-limited. Immunocompromised patients with Toxoplasma encephalopathy usually have  multiple lesions located in both hemispheres, with the basal ganglia and corticomedullary   junction most commonly involved in the MRI.
option D: Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes tuberculous (TB) encephalopathy and it is
exclusively seen in children and infants with pulmonary TB. It is characterized by cerebral edema sometimes with features similar to acute disseminated encephalopathy and may manifest with a   variety of symptoms ranging from focal neurological deficits to convulsions and decreased
conscious state.",,C,4472-2820-1.png
Q11,"A male patient presents with sensory loss and weakness of limbs for 3 months. He also has angular stomatitis. on examination, there is loss of proprioception, vibration sensations,    UMN type of lower limb weakness, and absent ankle reflex. what is the most probable
diagnosis?","a)Extradural cord compression
b)Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
c)Multiple sclerosis
d)subacute combined degeneration of cord","The given case scenario is suggestive of subacute combined degeneration (SACD) due to vitamin B12 deficiency.
Subacute combined degeneration (SACD) is due to the deficiency of vitamin B12. pernicious
anemia, partial gastrectomy, and Diphyllobothrium latum infestation can lead to this condition. The most severely affected regions in SACD are the posterior columns at the cervical and upper  thoracic levels.
patients with SACD present with the following features:
• Loss of vibration sense and proprioception
• paresthesia - upper limb paresthesias occur before lower limbs are affected.
• unsteady gait - due to sensory ataxia
• Loss of deep tendon reflexes
• peripheral neuropathy
• optic neuropathy - can present as blurring of vision
• psychiatric manifestations such as:
• Irritated behavior
• Severe dementia
• Frank psychosis
MRI spine shows myelopathy and areas of demyelination. Myelopathy of SACD tends to be diffuse rather than focal.



Treatment is replacement therapy with 1ooo μg of intramuscular vitamin B12 repeated at regular intervals or by oral vitamin B12.
other options:
option A: Patients with extradural spinal cord compression usually present with back pain that is aggravated in the supine position, tingling, or electric sensation along the back and upper and
lower limbs upon flexion or extending the neck. Loss of pain, vibration, and proprioception is    common. Extensor plantar reflex may be seen in significant compression. Deep tendon reflexes may be brisk.
option B: Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis present with, fasciculations, muscle cramps, distal weakness and atrophy, bulbar palsy - dysarthria, dysphagia, respiratory compromise,
spasticity, increased reflexes, flexor spasms, and pseudobulbar effects - inappropriate laughing, crying, yawning.
option c: Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous
system. The common symptoms of multiple sclerosis include paresthesia (tingling sensations,
pins, and needle sensation), hypesthesia (numbness), optic neuritis - decreased visual acuity and color perception, unilateral/ bilateral, limb weakness - spastic paralysis, gait disturbances,
Babinski's sign positive, facial weakness, vertigo, hearing loss, bladder dysfunction, Lhermitte's    sign (shooting pain down the back on neck movement), uhthoff's sign (worsening of neurological symptoms on exposure to elevated temperatures eg. hot shower)",,D,
Q12,"A 4o-year-old female patient came with complaints of chest pain, palpitation, and shortness   of breath. on examination, a mid-diastolic murmur was heard, and a prominent 'a' wave was found on JVP. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Mitral stenosis
b)Tricuspid stenosis
c)Mitral regurgitation
d)Tricuspid regurgitation","The presence of a mid-diastolic murmur and a prominent a-wave in JVP is suggestive of tricuspid stenosis.
Mid-diastolic murmurs result from obstruction and/or augmented flow at the level of the mitral or
tricuspid valve. Thus, both mitral stenosis (MS) and tricuspid stenosis (TS) present with a   mid-diastolic murmur. However, the presence of a prominent a-wave in JVP points toward tricuspid stenosis.
causes for mid-diastolic murmur:
• Mitral stenosis
• Tricuspid stenosis
• Atrial myxomas
• Austin Flint murmur in severe aortic regurgitation
• carey-coombs murmur in acute rheumatic fever Tricuspid stenosis:
It always occurs in association with MS and is rheumatic in origin. Mid-diastolic murmur in TS is best heard along the left sternal border and over the xiphoid process. Murmur is augmented
during inspiration and reduced during expiration. The jugular veins are distended, and a giant
a-wave is seen in JVP. There is a slow y descent due to impedance of right atrial emptying during diastole. EcG shows features of right atrial enlargement, which includes tall, peaked P wave in
lead II and a prominent, upright P wave in lead V1.





other options:
option A: Mid-diastolic murmur is seen in mitral stenosis (MS). It occurs most commonly in
rheumatic fever. Loud S1 (first heart sound) with an opening snap and a following S2 (second
heart sound) is heard. S2 is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, mid-diastolic murmur, which is best heard at the apex with the patient in a lateral recumbent position.


option C: Holosystolic murmur is seen in mitral regurgitation (MR). The major causes of MR are  infective endocarditis, myocardial infarction, rheumatic fever, and cardiomyopathies. Soft S1 with a widely split S2 and a low-pitched S3 (third heart sound) is heard in MR. In addition, a
holosystolic murmur is prominent at the apex and radiates to the axilla.





option D: Holosystolic murmur is seen in tricuspid regurgitation (TR). TR is most commonly due  to functional defects such as tricuspid annular dilatation and leaflet tethering caused by rheumatic heart disease, myocardial infarction, etc. The jugular vein is distended. Prominent c-v waves
and rapid y descents are seen in severe TR. A blowing holosystolic murmur along the lower left sternal margin, which is augmented during inspiration (Carvallo's sign) and reduced during
expiration is seen in TR.",,B,4474-2822-1.png;4474-2822-2.png;4474-2822-3.png
Q13,"A patient who is a known case of hypertension on multiple anti-hypertensive medications
came to OpD. His ECG finding is given below. which of the following drugs is responsible for the ECG finding?","a)prazosin
b)Metoprolol
c)Hydrochlorothiazide
d)spironolactone","Based on the ECG findings (tall T waves), the most likely diagnosis is hyperkalemia, and among the given drugs, spironolactone is the drug that is most likely to cause hyperkalemia.
Spironolactone is a potasium-sparing diuretic. It is a competitive inhibitor of
the mineralocorticoid receptor in the late distal tubule and collecting duct of the kidneys. It
causes a decrease in sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the distal tubule. As a result, spironolactone promotes sodium diuresis but maintains body potassium levels.
Hyperkalemia is defined as a serum potassium level of more than 5.5 mEq/L.
Hyperkalemia can cause drastic conduction changes. It can be diagnosed by a sequence of changes affecting the ST-T segments and QRS complex. ST-T segment changes reflect a change
in repolarization while QRS complex changes reflect a change in depolarization.
The ECG changes that can be seen in hyperkalemia depend on the extent of hyperkalemia.

S. N o.	Serum potassium le vel	ECG change
1	5.5-6.5 mEq/L	Tall, peaked T waves with 'te nted' or 'pinched' shape
2	6.5-7.5 mEq/L	loss of P waves
3	7.o-8.o mEq/L	widened QRS complex




s. N o.	serum potassium le vel	EcG change
4	> 8.o mEq/L	sine wave


•
Drugs that cause hyperkalemia include:
• Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
• Angiotensin receptor blockers eg. Losartan
• Mineralocorticoid receptor blockers like spironolactone, eplerenone, drospirenone
• Epithelial sodium channel (ENac) blockers like amiloride and triamterene
• others: Trimethoprim, pentamidine, nafamostat  Treatment of hyperkalemia involves the following:
• Administer intravenous calcium gluconate, which raises the threshold and reduces excitability. It is cardioprotective
• Administer regular insulin with dextrose. The insulin will reduce the serum potassium
concentration by causing an intracellular shift. The dextrose will counteract the hypoglycemic effects of insulin.
• salbutamol nebulization will also shift potassium inside the cell.
• Remove potassium with calcium-based resins, diuretics, or hemodialysis. other options:
option A: The major potential side effect of prazosin is postural hypotension and syncope.
option B: Metoprolol is a cardioselective beta blocker. cardioselective beta blockers are less likely to cause hyperkalemia as an adverse effect. The risk of metoprolol-induced hyperkalemia is
increased if the patient is also diabetic.



option C: Hydrochlorothiazides increase the renal excretion of potassium and thus cause hypokalemia if the dietary intake of potassium is less.",4462-2812.PNG,D,4481-2823.PNG
Q14,A 78-year-old woman presents with a progressive decline in daily activity. she gives a history  of convulsions and visual hallucinations. she does not talk to anyone and keeps looking at the sky. pathological examination shows the presence of Lewy bodies within the neurons. what is the most probable diagnosis?,"a)parkinson's disease
b)prion disease
c)Huntington's chorea
d)Alzheimer's disease","Based on the given clinical scenario and the pathological examination showing Lewy bodies within the neurons the most likely diagnosis, among the given options is parkinson's disease.
parkinson’s disease is due to widespread degeneration of the portion of the substantia nigra that sends dopamine-secreting nerve fibers to the caudate nucleus and putamen. on pathological
examination, intraneuronal proteinaceous inclusions called Lewy bodies that stain for α-synuclein are seen. Mutations in α-synuclein (sNCA), GBA, LRRK2, and pINK1/parkin are found to be
responsible for this condition.
It is characterized by rigidity, resting tremors, akinesia, bradykinesia, and postural instability.
other motor features are masked facies, reduced eye blinking, dysphagia, speech disorders,    freezing, and falling. other non-motor features include anosmia, sensory disturbances, mood
disorders (e.g., depression), sleep disturbances, autonomic disturbances, and cognitive impairment/dementia.
Levodopa combined with peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (carbidopa/benserazide) is considered the gold standard in the treatment of this disease.
other drugs used in the treatment:
• Dopamine agonists- pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine
• Monoamine oxidase (MAo-B) inhibitors - selegiline and rasagiline
• Catechol-o-methyl transferase (CoMT) inhibitors- Tolcapone and entacapone
other options:
option B: prion disease is a rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disorder that occurs due to    the abnormal folding of prion proteins. These proteins can undergo a structural change from an alpha helix to beta-pleated sheets (prpC to prpsC). These proteins can rapidly spread, invading  the central nervous system and inducing neuronal cell death. prion diseases can be sporadic in   nature, but more often they have a familial mode of spread due to mutations in the pRNp gene  that codes for prp. The brain classically undergoes spongiform degeneration due to vacuole
formation and rapid death of the neurons. Histopathological examination during post-mortem can reveal inclusion such as prpsC deposits and Kuru plaques.
option C: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant progressive brain disorder that
causes uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and loss of thinking ability. It occurs due to atrophy, with loss of neurons and gliosis in the caudate lobe, putamen, and globus pallidus. There is an abnormal expansion of the trinucleotide CAG in the Huntington gene on chromosome 4.
option D: Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. It has
an insidious onset with deficits developing over the course of 5-1o years. Initially, the patient
presents with forgetfulness but then progresses to language deficits, loss of mathematical skills, and motor skills. In the end stages, the patient becomes mute, incontinent, and unable to walk.  The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease involves the accumulation of Aβ amyloid and tau in the



brain. The hallmarks ofthis condition are amyloid plaques comprised of aggregated Aβ amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles.
Note: The possible diagnosis based on the given clinical scenario points to Lewy-body dementia. since the option was not given, the second best answer would be parkinson's disease.
Dementia with Lewy bodies is a progressive neurodegenerative associated with dementia,
psychosis, and features of parkinsonism. It is characterized by the protein deposition of Lewy
bodies in the substantia nigra, limbic system, and cerebral cortex, comprising of α-synuclein and ubiquitin. It is the third most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease and vascular     dementia.
The clinical features of dementia with Lewy bodies are characterized by visual hallucinations,
features of parkinsonism, neuroleptic sensitivity, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, behavior
disorder, and excessive daytime sleepiness. They can also present with delirium and orthostatic hypotension. Memory is usually preserved in patients with Lewy body dementia. If a typical
antipsychotic is prescribed for hallucinations and mild cognitive deficits, it can result in profound extrapyramidal adverse effects due to the sensitivity to neuroleptic agents. The features of
parkinsonism would include bradykinesia, resting tremor, cog-wheel rigidity, and festinating gait.
Dementia or neuropsychiatric conditions emerge concurrently with parkinsonism features in
dementia with Lewy bodies whereas parkinson's disease dementia occurs in long-standing cases of parkinson's disease. Recently it has been decided that if dementia or any cognitive disability
occurs after 12 months of parkinson's disease, then the disorder is most likely parkinson's disease dementia. If it is less than 12 months, then it is dementia with Lewy bodies.
Treatment: The pharmacotherapy would include cholinesterase inhibitors like rivastigmine, galantamine, and donepezil to treat the cognitive impairments. other medications include    antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics to treat depression and hallucinations respectively.
supportive therapies include physiotherapy, exercise, and family therapies.",,A,
Q15,"A patient came to medical OPD with complaints of polyuria. He has a history of undergoing total hypophysectomy. His Na+ levels are found to be 155 mEq/L, urine osmolarity was 2oo mOsm/L. what is the definitive management in this patient?","a)DDAVP for 2 weeks and then discontinue
b)DDAVP supplementation for lifelong
c)upsetting of receptors so no treatment is required
d)Thiazides for 2 weeks","Based on the given clinical vignette, the most likely diagnosis is central diabetes insipidus.
Lifelong supplementation of desmopressin (DDAVp), a synthetic analog of AVp, is the definitive management in this scenario.
Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a syndrome characterized by the excretion of abnormally large volumes of dilute urine. The 24-hour urine volume exceeds 4o mL/kg body weight, and the 24-hour urine  osmolarity is &lt;28o mosm/L. There will be a slight increase in plasma osmolarity/sodium that    stimulates thirst (polydipsia). Hence, clinical symptoms and signs of dehydration are uncommon  unless thirst and/or water intake are also impaired.
causes of central diabetes insipidus include
• Idiopathic
• Familial and congenital diseases -  familial neurohypophyseal DI, wolfram syndrome, congenital hypopituitarism
• Neurosurgery and trauma - Trauma to the hypothalamus and posterior pituitary or neurosurgery with a transsphenoidal approach.



• Neoplasms
• Hypoxic encephalopathy
• Infiltrative disorders-  Langerhans cell histiocytosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, autoimmune lymphocytic hypophysitis, and sarcoidosis
Treatment of central diabetes insipidus due to resection of pituitary tumor includes lifelong  supplementation with vasopressin analogs desmopressin (DDAVp) (1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin).
Note: If partial hypophysectomy, which is the usual procedure, is done, DDAVp supplementation is usually required only for a short duration as there is only a transient AVp deficiency. However, in complete hypophysectomy which results in permanent diabetes insipidus,
life-long administration of desmopressin may be required.",,B,
Q16,A 65-year-old chronic smoker came to the medicine outpatient department with complaints of upper chest discomfort and drooping of an eyelid. He also complained of pain radiating to the upper arm and a tingling sensation in the 4th and 5th digits of his right hand. The chest X-ray is given below. which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Pancoast tumor
b)upper lobe pneumonia
c)superior vena cava obstruction
d)Aspergilloma","pancoast's tumor is the most likely diagnosis in this patient.
pancoast syndrome/superior sulcus tumor results from a local extension of a tumor growing in
the apex of the lung, with the involvement of C8, T1, and T2 nerve roots, stellate ganglion, and the chest wall. It presents with pain that radiates to the ulnar distribution of the arm, often with the     destruction of the 1st and 2nd ribs. patients with the central or endobronchial growth of the
primary tumor may present with a cough, hemoptysis, wheeze, stridor, dyspnea, or
post-obstructive pneumonitis.
Regional spread can cause
• Tracheal obstruction
• Esophageal compression with dysphagia
• Recurrent laryngeal paralysis with hoarseness
• phrenic nerve palsy with the elevation of the hemidiaphragm and dyspnea
• sympathetic nerve paralysis with Horner’s syndrome (enophthalmos, ptosis, miosis, and anhydrosis)
Investigations in pancoast tumor:
• MRI &gt; CT is the investigation of choice for superior sulcus tumor/pancoast tumor as the associated soft tissue infiltration, the extent of which can be best visualized using an MRI.
• FDG-pET scan shows high uptake by the tumor cells. FDG is taken up by all metabolizing cells but more avidly by cancer cells.
• Bronchoscopy can be done in endobronchial tumors to obtain a tissue diagnosis. The image below shows the management of the pancoast tumor.





other options:
option B: pneumonia patients usually present with fever, cough, chills, tachycardia, and/or
sweats. Cough may be nonproductive or productive of mucoid, purulent, or blood-tinged sputum. other symptoms may include fatigue, headache, myalgias, and arthralgias.
option C: patients with superior vena cava obstruction usually present with neck and facial
swelling, dyspnea, and cough. symptoms may aggravate while bending forward or lying. The
characteristic physical findings are dilated neck veins, cyanosis, and edema of the face, arms, and chest. Facial swelling and plethora are typically exacerbated when the patient is supine.
option D: Aspergilloma (fungal ball) is a late manifestation of chronic cavitary pulmonary
aspergillosis, but some patients are asymptomatic. signs and symptoms include cough (sometimes productive), hemoptysis, wheezing, and mild fatigue. More significant signs and symptoms are
associated with chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis.",4463-2813.PNG,A,4485-2824.PNG
Q17,A chronic alcoholic patient presents with acute pain and swelling of the left great toe. There is no history of trauma. synovial fluid analysis shows raised leukocytes. Lab investigations show normal serum uric acid levels. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)pseudogout
b)Acute gout
c)Reactive arthritis
d)septic arthritis","The given clinical vignette points towards the diagnosis of acute gout.
Gout is a hyperuricemic metabolic condition, typically manifested by episodic inflammatory
arthritis due to crystal formation and deposition of monosodium urate (MsU) crystals within the joints and connective tissue.
Acute recurrent gout flare is characterized by painful, warm, red, tender, and substantially swollen joints. The metatarsophalangeal joint of the first toe is involved in 7o–9o% of cases (podagra),
followed by tarsal joints, ankles, and knees. Triggers of gout flares include purine-rich food,   alcohol, diuretic use, local trauma, and medical illnesses such as congestive heart failure and respiratory hypoxic conditions.
Diagnosis is made by synovial fluid examination, which may show needle-shaped monosodium urate crystals. These crystals show bright, negative birefringence under polarized light. WBC
count may be increased in synovial fluid. serum uric acid level is usually elevated in chronic gout



patients, but it may remain normal or low during acute attacks, because of the uricosuric property of inflammatory cytokines.
Management of acute gout includes the application of ice packs, rest, NSAIDS, colchicine, and glucocorticoids. In patients with chronic hyperuricemia urate-lowering agents like xanthine
oxidase inhibitors(eg. allopurinol and febuxostat) or uricosuric drugs (e.g. probenecid) can be used.
The negatively birefringent needle-shaped monosodium urate crystals under polarized microscopy are shown below.


other options:
option A: Pseudogout occurs due to the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD). It presents with features similar to acute gout and predominantly affects
the elderly. Acute attacks of CPPD present with joint swelling and pain, affecting the knee (most common), wrist, shoulders, elbows, and hands. It also has systemic features of inflammation
including fever, chills, and elevated CRP.
Chronic CPPD commonly presents as polyarticular arthritis resembling osteoarthritis (pseudo osteoarthritis). It affects atypical joints such as metacarpophalangeal, wrist, elbow, and ankle  joints causing severe damage.
X-ray or ultrasonography of the joint shows chondrocalcinosis, i.e, punctate or linear radiodense
deposits in the joint menisci or articular cartilage. Detection of rod-like or rhomboid crystals in synovial fluid or articular cartilage is diagnostic of pseudogout.
option C: Reactive arthritis, also called Reiter syndrome, is inflammatory arthritis that manifests several days to weeks after a gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection. It is also described as a    classic triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis.
option D: Septic arthritis is more common in children. It is the inflammation of joints secondary to an infection, usually bacteria. Hematogenous, secondary to nearby osteomyelitis, iatrogenic,    penetrating wounds, and umbilical cord sepsis are the common routes of the spread of infection. The knee, hip, shoulder, and elbow are the common joints involved. Synovial fluid may look
cloudy and WBC count is usually elevated predominantly with polymorphonuclear cells. The



causative organism can be seen under microscopic examination and the same can be cultured.",,B,4486-2825.PNG
