Q1,A 28 year old male admitted with history of altered sensorium and hydrophobia. A suspicion   of rabies was made and you want to diagnose the condition. You have taken corneal scrapings from the patient and which of the following tests will you do to confirm your diagnosis,"a)Indirect immunofluorescence
b)seller stain for negri bodies
c)viral culture
d)Real time PCR","viral culture from corneal scrapings is used to confirm diagnosis.
Multiple tests in succession/simultaneously are the best. usually Direct Fluorescent Antibody test followed by virus isolation/culture is useful.
virus isolation through culture: Best specimens are brain and saliva. CSF, corneal smears and centrifuged urine can also be used.
option A: Serological tests like indirect immunofluorescence are insensitive.
option B: Negri bodies can only be demonstrated in brain (pyramidal cells of Ammon?s horn, and the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum are the most common site).
option D: Real time-PCR Amplification Detection of rabies virus RNA is highly sensitive and specific. This technique can detect virus in freshsaliva samples, skin, CSF, and brain tissues.

Q2,Identify the parasite from the given life cycle.,"a)Fasciola hepatica
b)Fasciolopsis buski
c)Pargaonimus westermani
d)Clonorchis sinensus","The given life cycle belongs to Fasciola hepatica.
Fasciola hepatica (sheep liver fluke) causes disease primarily in sheep and other domestic
animals. Humans are infected by eating watercress (or other aquatic plants) contaminated by    larvae (metacercariae) that excyst in the duodenum, penetrate the gut wall, and reach the liver, where they mature into adults.
The adult flukes in the bile ducts produce eggs, which are excreted in the feces. The eggs hatch in freshwater and miracidia enter the snails. Miracidia develop into cercariae, which then encyst on  aquatic vegetation. Sheep and humans eat the plants, thus completing the life cycle. Most
infections are asymptomatic. Halzoun is a painful pharyngitis caused by the presence of adult flukes on the posterior pharyngeal wall after eating raw sheep liver. obstructive jaundice can  occur months or years later.
Diagnosis is made by identification of the eggs in the feces.",1334-804.PNG,A,
Q3,The life cycle given below is of which of the following:,"a)Entamoeba vermicularis
b)Ancylostoma duodenal
c)Balantidium coli
d)Entamoeba histolytica","The given life cycle is of Entamoeba histolytica.
Its life cycle includes 2 stages - the motile trophozoite and the non-motile cyst, both of which are seen in the image shown above. The transmission is primarily by the fecal-oral route. There is no animal reservoir. The most frequent site of systemic disease is the liver.
The ingested cysts differentiate into trophozoites in the ileum which invade the colonic
epithelium. The trophozoites penetrate the submucosal layer and form abscesses which break down to form flask-shaped ulcers.

The trophozoites multiply by binary fission and produce cysts, and both stages are passed in the feces. Trophozoites are rapidly destroyed outside the body. Cysts survive in the external
environment and are responsible for transmission.
Note: The genus Entamoeba has four morphologically identical species - E. histolytica, E. dispar, E. bangladeshi, and E. moshkovskii. E. moshkovskii which was initially thought to be
non-pathogenic has recently been shown to be a causative agent of non-invasive diarrhea.",1335-805.PNG,D,

Malaria relapse :
In case of plasmodium vivax and ovale two kinds of sporozoites are seen, some of which multiply inside hepatic cells to form schizonts and others persist and remain dormant as hypnozoites.
True relapse is caused due to hypnozoites (resting forms). some get activated to become schizonts and release merozoites, which go on infecting RBcs producing clinical relapse.
In case of plasmodium falciparum and malariae, the initial tissue phase disappears completely and no hypnozoites are found, hence relapse is not seen.",,C,

c)There is a risk of elevation of transaminases
d)Liver parenchymal cells are in a state of high proliferation","In most tumors, HBV DNA is integrated into the cell genome, and in most cases, the virus DNA has undergone rearrangements, including deletions. After integration, it promotes the

Q19,Identify the following?,"a)Entamoeba dispar
b)Giardia lamblia
c)Balantidium coli
d)Entamoeba histolytica","The above image shows giardia lamblia.
Cysts are resistant forms and are responsible for transmission of giardiasis. Both cysts and
trophozoites can be found in the feces (diagnostic stages). The cysts are hardy and can survive several months in cold water.
Infection occurs by the ingestion of cysts in contaminated water, food, or by the fecal-oral route (hands or fomites).
In the small intestine, excystation releases trophozoites (each cyst produces two trophozoites). Trophozoites multiply by longitudinal binary fission, remaining in the lumen of the proximal   small bowel where they can be free or attached to the mucosa by a ventral sucking disk.
Encystation occurs as the parasites transit toward the colon. The cyst is the stage found most  commonly in nondiarrheal feces.  Because the cysts are infectious when passed in the stool or shortly afterward, person-to-person transmission is possible.
Giardia lamblia exists in :
? Infective form ? Quadrinucleate cyst

b)Immunoflourescence
c)Toxin gene detection by PCR
d)Toxin Detection by ELISA","Nucleic acid amplification tests, including PCR assays, for C. difficile toxin A or B gene in stool have been approved for diagnostic purposes of Clostridium difficile infection due to high
sensitivity, specificity and rapid turnaround time.
The diagnosis of CDI is based on a combination of clinical criteria:
(1) diarrhea (=3 unformed stools per 24 h for =2 days) with no other recognized cause plus
(2) toxin A or B detected in the stool, toxin- producing C. difficile detected in the stool by PCR or culture, or pseudomembranes seen in the colon.
other diagnostic methods include :
? stool Culture in selective media
? Demonstrating Toxin by Hep-2 cell cultures
? Toxin gene identification by Enzyme immunoassay
? Colonscopy or sigmoidoscopy
Despite the array of tests available for C. difficile and its toxins, no single traditional test has high sensitivity, high specificity, and rapid turnaround.

Most laboratory tests for toxins, including enzyme immunoassays, lack sensitivity.
Nucleic acid amplification tests, including PCR assays, for C. difficile toxin A or B gene in stool     have now been approved for diagnostic purposes and appear to be both rapid and sensitive while retaining high specificity.",,C,

Q22,Bio-film confer resistance to antibiotics by all except _______,"a)Mechanical barrier
b)Increased excretion of antibiotics
c)slow metabolism
d)Adherence","Adherence is a mechanism of bacteria to attach to host cell for penetration. It is not a mechanism of resistance.
Mechanisms of biofilm-mediated resistance to antibiotics:
? Mechanical barrier: The lipopolysaccharide biofilms prevent entry of water-soluble drugs.
? Efflux pumps: These pumps on the biofilms actively excrete drug out.
? slow metabolism: Decreased oxygen and nutrients passage through the biofilms slows down the metabolism of bacteria.
? Anaerobic pathway: Because of the above reason bacteria follow anaerobic metabolism.
? Persisters: some bacteria undergo phenotypic modification into dormant, spore-like structure and survive antibiotic insult. These are called as persisters which are activated later.
? Enzymatic inactivation of drugs by biofilms
? Genetic adaptation to antibiotic insults
? Quorum sensing: It is cell to cell signaling among the bacteria to coordinate among themselves for contribution in biofilm synthesis.",,D,

b)Toxic shock syndrome
c)septicemia
d)staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome","staphylococcal septicemia is not toxin mediated.
septicemia occurs due to the invasion of bacterial organisms into the bloodstream. This causes an inflammatory response to bacterial products, leading to various manifestations seen in sepsis -
fever, hypotension, alkalosis.
Toxin mediated staphylococcal infections include food poisoning caused by enterotoxin, toxic
shock syndrome caused by toxic shock syndrome toxin and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome caused by exfoliative/epidermolytic toxin.",,C,
