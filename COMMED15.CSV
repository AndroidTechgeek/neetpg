Q4,what is the communication barrier if interpretation of a words are understood in a different manner?,"a)Linguistic barrier
b)semantic barrier
c)psychological barrier
d)cultural barrier","The communication barrier that occurs when the interpretation of words is understood differently is called a semantic Barrier.
Semantic barriers arise from misunderstandings due to differences in the meaning of words, phrases, or symbols. These barriers can cause confusion and misinterpretation, leading to
ineffective communication.
example: In a public health campaign, ""herd immunity"" may be misunderstood by some as meaning they don’t need vaccination or as related to animals. This confusion can reduce     vaccination rates and is a perfect example of a semantic barrier.

Disaster preparedness refers to long-term development activities that strengthen the capacity of a country to manage all kinds of emergencies effectively.
• Response - This includes activities such as:
• Triage: Classifying the injured based on the severity of the injuries and chances of survival with medical intervention.
• Tagging: Tags with name, age, triage category, diagnosis and treatment are put for identification purposes.
• Identification of the dead: The dead bodies should be shifted from the disaster site to the mortuary.
• Rehabilitation - This includes measures that lead to the restoration of pre-disaster
conditions. These measures include water supply restoration, food safety, basic
sanitation, personal hygiene, and vector control.
• Mitigation - This includes measures to prevent disasters from causing emergencies or to lessen   the likely effects of emergencies. some of them are flood mitigation, land use planning, improved building codes, and the reduction and protection of vulnerable populations or structures.



• preparedness - This is a program that aims at strengthening the capacity of a country to manage all types of emergencies efficiently. Its objective is to ensure that appropriate measurements are    taken for the relief and rehabilitation of disaster victims.

b)Multidimensional poverty Index
c)Disability-adjusted life years
d)Human Development Index","The index that is calculated using the given indicators such as life expectancy at birth, mean and    expected years of schooling, and the per capita income is the Human Developmental Index (HDI). Human Development Index (HDI) is defined as a composite index focusing on three basic
dimensions of human development. It assesses abilities
• To lead a healthy long life - measured by life expectancy at birth
• To acquire knowledge- measured by mean years of schooling
• To achieve a decent standard of living- measured by gross national income per capita
Hence the 3 dimension indices used to calculate the human development index are as follows life expectancy index, education index, and gross national index.
other options:
option A- Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI) uses three indicators which include infant mortality, life expectancy at age one, and literacy rate.
option B- Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) - It is an international measure of acute

Q14,"A mother delivers a baby in a rural area with the assistance of a skilled birth attendant. The attendant cuts the umbilical cord cleanly, ties the ends with new threads, bathes the baby
with warm water, wipes the baby’s eyes with a sterile wet cloth from the medial to lateral
corner, and then hands the baby to the mother for skin-to-skin contact. which of these steps is incorrect?","a)using new threads to tie the ends of the umbilical cord
b)wiping the baby’s eyes from medial to lateral corner
c)skin-to-skin contact with the mother
d)Bathing the child with warm water","The incorrect step is bathing the child with warm water immediately after birth. It is generally
recommended to delay bathing in the immediate newborn period to help maintain the baby’s body temperature and prevent hypothermia.
other options:
option A: using new threads to tie the ends of the umbilical cord is correct and helps prevent infection and ensure proper cord care.
option B: wiping the baby’s eyes from the medial to lateral corner is appropriate to prevent the spread of any potential infection from the eye’s inner to outer corners.
option C: skin-to-skin contact with the mother is beneficial as it helps stabilize the baby’s temperature, promotes bonding, and supports early breastfeeding.",,D,
Q15,"A homeless man comes with diarrhea, dementia, and dermatitis. He consumes alcohol
occasionally. He admits to having 'X' as his staple diet. which of the following is X most likely to be?","a)Maize
b)wheat
c)Milk
d)peanuts","This patient with symptoms of dementia, diarrhea and dermatitis most likely has niacin/vitamin B3 deficiency. X  is likely to be maize in his diet.
Niacin deficiency causes pellagra, found mostly among people eating corn/maize-based diets,
which is low in niacin and tryptophan. Excess leucine in jowar and maize disrupts the conversion of tryptophan to niacin.
Niacin can be synthesized in the body from tryptophan. Two compounds- nicotinic acid, and
nicotinamide have the biological activity of niacin. The nicotinamide ring of the coenzymes NAD ( nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate)
participate in oxidation/reduction reactions.
The initial symptoms of pellagra include loss of appetite, generalized weakness, irritability,
abdominal pain, and vomiting. This is followed by bright red glossitis and a characteristic
pigmented, scaly skin rash in sun-exposed areas. This rash is known as Casal’s necklace when it forms a ring around the neck.



The 4Ds of pellagra:
• Diarrhea
• Dermatitis
• Dementia, leading to
• Death
It is diagnosed by measuring urinary levels of 2-methyl nicotinamide and 2-pyridone.
It is treated by oral supplementation of 1oo–2oo mg of nicotinamide or nicotinic acid three times daily for 5 days.

Q16,"In the Motivation model of health education, there are three stages for the adoption of new ideas. what is the third one other than awareness &amp; motivation?","a)contemplation
b)Reflection
c)Action
d)Dedication","The third stage in the Motivation model of health education, following awareness and motivation, is action.
In the process of adopting new ideas or behaviours, individuals progress through distinct stages. The first stage, awareness, involves gaining general information about health needs and issues,   which serves as the foundation for further exploration. without awareness, individuals may not   recognize the importance of making changes to their health behaviours.
The second stage, motivation, encompasses interest, evaluation, and decision-making. Here,
individuals express curiosity about the information presented, seek out additional details, and
weigh the pros and cons of adopting the new behaviour. This stage often requires interpersonal
communication and support from peers and family, as individuals contemplate the implications of their choices.
Finally, in the action stage, individuals actively adopt and implement the new behaviour or idea into their lives. This involves not just the decision to change but also taking concrete steps to
integrate the new practice into their daily routine. It is during this stage that the new behaviour



becomes part of an individual's values and lifestyle, leading to sustained change. Effective
communication strategies are essential to support individuals as they navigate through these stages, ensuring a successful transition to healthier behaviours.
Note:  The three models of health education:
• Medical model: Transfer of proven medical information into education
• Motivational model: Awareness → Motivation → Action or Internalization
• social intervention model: changing of a social environment",,C,
Q17,"An unvaccinated 5-year-old child presents with a sore throat and difficulty in swallowing. on examination, she has a greyish membrane over her tonsils. she has a fully vaccinated
2-year-old brother who was asymptomatic. what is the appropriate management of this contact?","a)No intervention
b)Booster dose of toxoid
c)single dose of immunoglobulin
d)prophylactic dose of penicillin","The given clinical features of sore throat and difficulty in swallowing with a greyish-white
membrane over the tonsils in an unvaccinated child is suggestive of pharyngeal diphtheria. The
appropriate management for the asymptomatic 2-year-old brother of the child with diphtheria is   to initiate prophylactic antibiotic treatment with penicillin, regardless of his immunization status.
Diphtheria is caused by the bacteria corynebacterium diphtheriae which spreads via droplets  through the respiratory tract (most important), cutaneous lesions, and fomites. Management   includes antitoxin therapy as a single empirical dose of 2o,ooo-1oo,ooo units and antibiotics.
penicillin G/ Benzylpenicillin is the drug of choice for diphtheria. However, in case of an allergy to the same, Erythromycin is used. Other antibiotics used are clindamycin, rifampin, and
tetracycline.
All household contacts of diphtheria should be closely monitored for 7 days. culture should be taken from both the throat and nose. After culture, all contacts should receive the following:
• Antibiotic prophylaxis (benzathine penicillin G or erythromycin), regardless of immunization status.
• If fewer than three doses of diphtheria toxoid have been given, or vaccination history is  unknown, an immediate dose of diphtheria toxoid should be given and the primary series completed according to the current schedule.
• If more than 5 years have elapsed since the administration of the diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine, a booster dose should be given.
• If the most recent dose was within 5 years, no booster is required.
At least two successive negative cultures obtained 24 hr apart after completion of therapy are needed to confirm the elimination of the organism.",,D,
Q18,"A disease has an incubation period of 3-14 days. It has a median incubation of 1o days. A person had to travel abroad and he was not vaccinated. As the disease is of international  significance, how long will he have to be quarantined?","a)2o days
b)14 days
c)28 days
d)1o days","A person who is not vaccinated and has been exposed to a disease of international significance (like cOVID) with an incubation period of 3-14 days should be quarantined for 14 days(longest incubation period).



Quarantine is defined as the limitation of freedom of movement of well-persons or animals,
exposed to a communicable disease for a period of time not longer than the longest usual
incubation period, to prevent contact with those not exposed. This is done to prevent the potential spread of the disease during its incubation period, which is the time between exposure and the
onset of symptoms.
The quarantined person:
• should stay in a well-ventilated single room and stay away from high-risk individuals
• should not attend any religious or social gatherings
• Must wash hands often
• Their surroundings must be disinfected with 1% sodium hypochlorite solution
In case the person being quarantined becomes symptomatic, all his contacts should be home
quarantined for 14 days and followed up for another 14 days or till the report turns out negative on lab testing.
Note: The median incubation period refers to the time between exposure to a pathogen and the    onset of symptoms in 5o% of cases. And isolation is the separation and restriction of movements or activities of persons who are sick, to prevent the transmission of disease.",,B,
Q19,The image shown corresponds to which health program and disease?,"a)AROHI for HIV
b)AMITHA for polio
c)SAPANA for leprosy

Q20,"A study is investigating the relationship between diet and the incidence of a particular
disease. Among 1oo vegetarians, 3o individuals are found to have the disease, while among 1oo non-vegetarians, 5o individuals are affected. which biostatistical method is most
appropriate to determine if there is no significant association between diet and disease incidence?","a)Mann-whitney test
b)correlation coefficient
c)T-squared test
d)chi-square test","To determine whether there is an association between diet (vegetarians vs. non-vegetarians) and    the incidence of disease (present or absent), the best biostatistical method to use is the Chi-square test.
other options:
option A: Mann-whitney test is used for comparing two independent groups on a continuous or ordinal outcome, but in this case, both variables (diet and disease) are categorical.
option B: The correlation coefficient measures the strength of a linear relationship between two continuous variables, but it is not appropriate for categorical data.
option C: T-squared test is typically used for multivariate hypothesis testing and is not suited for testing relationships between categorical variables like diet and disease incidence.",,D,
Q21,which of the following options best defines the correct sequence of the phases of the demographic cycle?,"a)High expanding→ Early stationary → Late expanding → Low stationary → Declining
b)High stationary → Early expanding → Late expanding → Low stationary → Declining
c)Low stationary → Early expanding → Declining
d)Late expanding → High stationary → Declining","The correct sequence of the phases ofthe demographic cycle is High stationary → Early
expanding → Late expanding → Low stationary → Declining.
India is currently in the ""late expanding"" stage which is the third stage in the demographic cycle where declining death rates and declining birth rates are seen.
Another important concept of the demographic cycle is the demographic gap which is
the difference between birth rate and death rate. The demographic gap is maximum in the
early-expanding phase, characterized by a high birth rate and low death rate. As the demography  of the country transitions to the late-expanding phase, both birth rate and death rate falls causing a decreasing demographic gap. Although the birth rate is falling in the late-expanding phase, it is  still higher than the death rate, which causes the population to increase.",,B,
Q22,"A man presents with sudden onset bilateral leg swelling, diarrhea, and difficulty breathing. He reports consuming mustard oil purchased from a local vendor prior to the onset of
symptoms. A health inspector is investigating the cause of his condition. which test is the most appropriate to detect the adulterant in the mustard oil?","a)paper chromatography Test
b)Methylene Blue Test
c)phosphatase Test
d)Nitric Acid Test","The clinical scenario is suggestive of epidemic dropsy. paper chromatography test is used to
identify the presence of toxic alkaloids from Argemone mexicana seeds that adulterate mustard oil.
Epidemic dropsy is caused by the toxic compound sanguinarine, which is present in argemone oil extracted from argemone seeds. It is commonly used as an adulterant in mustard oil.
Epidemic dropsy results in sudden onset of swelling of lower limbs, diarrhea, and breathlessness. some patients may develop hypersecretory glaucoma. It can lead to death due to cardiac failure.

Q24,"A 37-year-old woman from Bihar presents with fever and unexplained weight loss over the past 6 months. Examination reveals massive splenomegaly and blood investigations show  anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypergammaglobulinemia. what is the vector of the
organism causing this condition?","a)phlebotomus species
b)Aedes mosquito
c)Mite
d)Female anopheles mosquito","From the given clinical features, the most likely disease is visceral leishmaniasis or kala azar
caused by Leishmania donovani, and the vector is a female phlebotomus sandfly. A patient from Bihar presenting with fever, weight loss, and hepatosplenomegaly with a smear examination
showing anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypergammaglobulinemia point towards the diagnosis.
Leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of an infected female phlebotomus sandfly. In India, it is endemic to Bihar, west Bengal, Jharkhand, and uttar pradesh. patients present with high fever,   hepatosplenomegaly, weight loss, and emaciation. The skin becomes dry, rough, and darkly
pigmented. There is anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.
The parasite exists in 2 forms:
• Amstigote form (also called LD bodies)- It is seen within macrophages and contains a kinetoplast.
• promastigote form- It is the infective form in the sandfly. The kinetoplast is seen at the anterior end.
kinetoplast are non-nuclear DNA present in addition to nucleus. They consist of blepharoplast and parabasal body. Flagellum originates near the kinetoplast.
Diagnosis of kala-azar is mainly by demonstration of amastigotes within macrophages in tissue aspirates such as blood smears, bone marrow, splenic, or lymph node aspirate. It is the gold
standard for diagnosis.
The image below shows amastigotes located intracellularly within macrophages.


Treatment is with a pentavalent antimonial compound. In Bihar, there is resistance to antimony so amphotericin-B-deoxycholate or miltefosine is preferred.
In human beings, different species of Leishmania can cause the following diseases:
• visceral leishmaniasis, or kala-azar,
• cutaneous leishmaniasis,



• Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, and
• Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis.
The life cycle of Lesihmania is shown below.


other options:
option B: The Aedes mosquito is the vector for diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and zika virus, none of which fit the clinical profile of visceral leishmaniasis.
option C: Mites are vectors for diseases such as scrub typhus, which typically presents with fever and an eschar, but it does not explain the massive splenomegaly or hematologic findings seen in  this case.

prevent or delay the root causes of disease and disability by decimating the one major risk factor which is biological aging.",,A,
Q28,"For standards of ventilation, the widely quoted standard is that of De Chaumont who
advocated a fresh air supply of 3ooo cubic feet per person per hour. It is calculated based on which parameter?","a)Humidity of air
b)o2 content of air
c)Temperature of air
d)Co2 content of air","For standards of ventilation, Co2 content of air is the paramater used to calculate fresh air supply of 3ooo cubic feet per person per hour which was advocated by De Chaumont.
ventilation involves the quality control of incoming air but not quality control of outgoing air. It also involves the replacement of vitiated air(air with decreased oxygen content) by a supply of     fresh outdoor air. It aims to provide a comfortable thermal environment and reduce the risk of   infections.
Fresh air supply off 3ooo cubic feet per person per hour is a good standard for air requirement. It is observed that the amount of Co2 due to respiration is not more than 2 parts in 1ooo parts of
air, then the air in the room is considered fresh.",,D,
Q29,which vaccine will be placed at zone 3 in the device shown below?,"a)pentavalent
b)Hep B
c)opv
d)DpT","The image shown in the question is of an ice-lined refrigerator (ILR). The opv vaccines are stored in the zone 3 that corresponds to the lowest
ILRs are the main method of vaccine storage in primary health centers. They are an important part of the cold chain and they maintain a temperature of 2 to 8 °C for the storage of vaccines.
They have different temperature zones for different vaccines. The upper zone is for
freeze-sensitive vaccines like cholera, hep B, rotavirus(liquid), etc while the lower zone is for heat-sensitive vaccines like opv, measles, etc.
All vaccines are kept in the basket provided with ILR. vaccines like opv, BCG, measles, and JE
can be kept at the bottom of the basket while, DpT, TT, Hep B, Ipv, and pentavalent vaccines and diluents are kept in the upper part of the basket.",2643-1623.PNG,C,2662-1629.PNG
Q30,Pick the correct statement regarding the sanchol cholera vaccine,"a)Bivalent vaccine given in 2 liquid doses orally to children &gt;=1 year of age
b)Bivalent given in single dose orally to children &gt;1 years of age
c)Monovalent given in 2 liquid doses orally with a bicarbonate buffer
d)Monovalent given in a single dose orally with a bicarbonate buffer","The sanchol cholera vaccine is a bivalent vaccine given in 2 liquid doses orally to children &gt;=1 year of age.
The sanchol cholera vaccine is a bivalent oral cholera vaccine (ocv) that targets both vibrio
cholerae o1 and vibrio cholerae o139 serogroups, which are the primary causes of cholera
outbreaks. It is designed to provide immunity by stimulating the production of antibodies in the intestines, the site of infection.
key Features of the sanchol vaccine:
Bivalent Nature: The vaccine protects against two strains of the cholera bacterium: o1, which is responsible for most global cholera cases, and o139 which is seen in south Asia.
Dosing schedule: The sanchol vaccine is administered in two oral doses. The doses are given 14     days apart for children aged 1 year and above as well as adults. This two-dose regimen is essential for achieving effective immunity. The vaccine is provided in liquid form, making it easy to
administer. It does not require any special preparation, such as mixing with a bicarbonate buffer, which is needed for some older cholera vaccines.
Age Recommendation: The vaccine is recommended for individuals aged 1 year and older. It is  particularly useful in endemic regions or during outbreaks to prevent the spread of the disease.
Efficacy and Duration: sanchol has been shown to provide significant protection against cholera for up to 3-5 years after vaccination, although booster doses may be required in areas with
ongoing transmission.
The vaccine is widely used in mass vaccination campaigns, especially in areas prone to cholera outbreaks, such as refugee camps or regions with poor sanitation. It has been a critical tool in  reducing the incidence of cholera in many endemic areas.",,A,
Q31,"In a town, there were 1ooo live births in a period of 6 months. During the same period, 12 women died due to the following causes. what is the maternal mortality ratio?","a)8oo per 1ooooo live births
b)2o per 1ooo live births
c)125 per 1ooo live births
d)4oo per 1ooooo live births","This town's maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is 8oo per 1oo,ooo live births.
Maternal mortality refers to deaths during pregnancy or within 42 days of termination of
pregnancy, from causes related to pregnancy. Excluding the deaths from traffic accidents and snake bite, the total number of maternal deaths is 8.
MMR = (Number of maternal deaths in a given year / Number of live births in the same area and year) x 1,oo,ooo (or 1ooo).
Hence, MMR = 8 x 1ooooo/1ooo = 8oo per 1oo,ooo live births.",,A,
Q32,which of the following steps of disaster management is in correct order?,"a)Disaster impact – Mitigation – Rehabilitation – Response

• Disaster impact and response includes:
• search, rescue and first aid must be done first.



• Field care
• Triage
• Lagging
• Identification of dead
• Rehabilitation or recovery includes:
• water supply
• sanitation and personal hygiene
• Food safety
• vector control
• Mitigation:
• Measures designed to either prevent hazards or reduce the effects of the disaster leading to disaster preparedness.",,C,
