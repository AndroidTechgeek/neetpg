Q1,The region marked corresponds to the surface marking for which of the following structures:,"a) Thoracic duct
b) Right atrium
c) Inferomedial bronchopulmonary segments
d) Hilum","The region marked corresponds to the surface marking for the right atrium.
The costal margin, xiphoid process, and the mid-clavicular line are seen in this image. The examiner draws a laterally convex line that extends from a level below the 2nd costal cartilage (as clued in by the sternal angle) i.e., 3rd costal cartilage to about 3 spaces below i.e., the 6th costal cartilage. This line is about 1.2 cms lateral to the sternal edge. These suggest that the region marked corresponds to the surface marking for the right atrium.
The projection of the cardiac borders, of an average adult, onto the anterior thoracic wall forms a trapezoid.  This can be mapped out using the percussion method by looking for cardiac dullness.
The varying heart borders and the corresponding surface markings are as follows:
• upper border: slopes gently from the second left costal cartilage to the third right costal cartilage. It corresponds to the left atrium.
• Right border: convex to the right and runs from the third to the sixth right costal cartilages, 1–2 cm lateral to the sternal edge. It corresponds to the right atrium.
• Inferior border or acute border: Runs leftwards from the 6th right costal cartilage to the cardiac apex which is located approximately 9 cm lateral to the midline, often in the left 5th intercostal space or level with the 5th or 6th rib. It corresponds to the right ventricle.
• Left border or obtuse border: convex laterally on the left. It extends superomedially from the cardiac apex to meet the second left costal cartilage about 1 cm from the left sternal edge. It corresponds to the left ventricle.",67-51.PNG,B,79-66.PNG

Q12,All of the following form the marked structure except:,"a) 2nd Dorsal interossei
b) Lumbricals
c) Extensor digitorum
d) 2nd palmar interossei","The structure marked in the image is the dorsal digital expansion of the middle finger. palmar interossei do not attach to the middle finger and therefore it does not contribute to the dorsal digital expansion of the middle finger.
palmar interossei are unipennate muscles originating from their own metacarpal bone. Their function is adduction. The middle finger does not need adduction and hence does not have palmar interossei.
Dorsal interossei are bipennate muscles originating from the adjacent metacarpal bone. They attach to the middle three fingers on both sides and do not attach on the thumb and little finger. Their function is abduction. The thumb and little finger have other muscles for abduction.

Endocardial cushions contribute to the formation of:
• Atrial septa

• Atrioventricular canals
• Atrioventricular valves
• Aortic and pulmonary channels
Defects in endocardial cushion formation can result in cardiac malformations, including ASDs, VSDs, and defects involving the great vessels (transposition of the great vessels, common truncus arteriosus, and tetralogy of Fallot).",76-64.PNG,A,
