Q1,A child was brought with bony deformities as shown in the radiograph below. It could be due to the deficiency of which of the following?,"a)vitamin A
b)vitamin D
c)vitamin K
d)vitamin C","The given pediatric radiograph depicts the bowing of legs, which occurs due to rickets that results from the deficiency of vitamin D. Deficiency of vitamin D and calcium results in poor
mineralization of bone, leading to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults.
Rickets presents with skeletal changes like bowing of legs and bone pain once the child starts to walk. Radiological features show cupping at metaphyses, fraying, and widening of the growth
plate. prominent costochondral joints (rachitic rosary), craniotabes, frontal bossing, scoliosis,
fractures, and dental anomalies may also be seen. The only cutaneous manifestation of vitamin D deficiency is alopecia.
other options:
option A: vitamin A deficiency results in night blindness, xerophthalmia, and keratinization of the skin.
option C: vitamin K deficiency leads to hemorrhagic disease in newborns and elevated
prothrombin time and bleeding. vitamin K acts as a cofactor in the synthesis of coagulation
proteins. Toxicity due to vitamin K results in hemolysis, hyperbilirubinemia, and kernicterus in the newborn.
option D: vitamin C deficiency leads to scurvy, which occurs due to defective collagen
formation resulting in generalized bleeding tendencies and poor wound healing. Radiographic features of scurvy include the white line of Frankel, Trummerfeld zone, pelkan spurs, and
periosteal elevation. Tender nodules at the costochondral junctions, known as the scorbutic rosary, are characteristic.",5427-3465.PNG,B,5405-3441.PNG
Q2,In which of the following nerve injuries is the instrument shown below used?,"a)Radial nerve
b)Median nerve
c)ulnar nerve
d)volkmann's ischemic contracture","The image shown above is that of a cock-up splint. It is used to manage radial nerve palsy.



Radial nerve palsy manifests as an inability to dorsiflex the wrist and digits (wrist drop and finger drop). Numbness occurs on the dorsoradial aspect of the hand and the dorsal aspect of the radial  3 1/2 digits.
other options:
option B: Median nerve injury happens in carpel tunnel syndrome where a nocturnal
wrist splinting that helps to maintain the hand in a neutral position could be of help during the initial therapy to alleviate symptoms. It prevents prolonged flexion or extension of the wrist.
option C: ulnar nerve injury / ulnar claw hand could be managed with a  knuckle bender splint if nerve recovery is anticipated. The splint can be used to correct and prevent metacarpophalangeal hyperextension.
option D: volkmann’s ischaemic contracture (vIN) is most commonly seen
following supracondylar humeral fractures. Mild cases of vIN are treated with a volkmann's splint (Turnbuckle splint).

Q3,A patient presented with chronic knee pain but has no history of trauma. Identify the condition shown in the radiograph below and the appropriate management.,"a)patellar avulsion fracture, TBW
b)Bipartite fracture patella, X-ray of other knee
c)Fracture of upper pole of patella, cylindrical cast
d)Avulsion fracture , interfragmentary screw fixation","The given X-Ray shows a patella with a smooth discontinuity suggestive of an unfused accessory ossification center. since this should arouse the suspicion of a bipartite patella, appropriate
management would be to take an X-Ray of the other knee.
A bipartite patella (two-part patella) is a patella with an unfused accessory ossification centre,
typically at the superolateral aspect. It usually is asymptomatic and is noted incidentally, however pain, when present, can be caused by overuse (such as in a cyclist or climber).
There are three types of bipartite patella
• Type I (5%) occurs at the inferior pole
• Type II (2o%) occurs along the entire lateral border of the patella
• Type III (75%) the most common type, occurs as an elliptical area in the superolateral portion of the patella
Depending on the number of fragments they may be classified as bipartite, tripartite or
multipartite. For diagnosis, a conventional skyline view is followed by a skyline view with the
patient in a squatting weight-bearing position to assess if the pain is caused by a nonunion at the bipartite site. If the gap is higher in the squatting weight-bearing posture than in the standard
skyline view, the test result is considered positive. MRI is not required to diagnose the condition.
If pain occur with a bipartite patella, limiting and restricting activity, correcting the activity that is causing an overuse syndrome, and prescribing nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents can result in improvement in 3 weeks. operative treatment with the ogata technique is rarely necessary.",5428-3466.PNG,B,
Q4,A patient at the orthopedics OPD complains of troubled sleep at night due to numbness and    tingling sensation involving his lateral 3 digits. His symptoms are relieved as he lays his arms hanging from the bed. which among the following options correctly describes his condition     along with the test used to assess it?,"a)Guyon's canal syndrome, Froment's test
b)carpal tunnel syndrome, Froment's test
c)Guyon's canal syndrome, Durkan's test
d)carpal tunnel syndrome, Durkan's test","The given clinical vignette is suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome and it can be assessed by Durkan's test.
Durkan's test is the most specific test for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. In Durkan's test, direct compression of the median nerve is done for about 3o seconds, which elicits
paresthesias and pain in cases of carpal tunnel syndrome.
carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common entrapment mononeuropathy caused by
compression of the median nerve as it passes through the fibro-osseous carpal tunnel beneath the flexor retinaculum. patients present with pain and paresthesia over the radial 3 and a half digits.  There may be a weakness of thumb opposition. In chronic cases, the thenar eminence is wasted.   carpal tunnel syndrome can be associated with rheumatoid arthritis, pregnancy, chronic renal
failure, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, and gout. The diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds but nerve conduction studies can confirm the diagnosis.
other tests for cTS -
• phalen's test - Elicited by holding the wrist flexed fully. The appearance of sensory symptoms within 6o seconds implies a positive test.
• Tinel's sign - Sensory symptoms reproduced by percussing over the median nerve imply a positive test.
Guyon’s canal is a fibro-osseous canal, approximately 4 cm long in the adult, on the anteromedial  aspect of the wrist under the superficial part of the flexor retinaculum. The ulnar nerve passes in    Guyon’s canal along with the ulnar artery and can be compressed here.  Froment's test is used in a suspected ulnar nerve injury.
In Froment's test or Book Test, the patient is asked to grasp a book or a sheet of paper between   the thumb and index finger. Due to weakness of the adductor pollicis muscle, adduction of the     thumb is lost. when asked to hold a book, the patient tries to hold the book by using the flexor   pollicis longus muscle instead of the adductor, this produces flexion at the interphalangeal joint.
The picture below shows Froment's test






Non-surgical Management of carpal Tunnel Syndrome: In mild to moderate cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, non-surgical management options can be explored to alleviate symptoms and improve  function. These conservative treatments include:
•
wrist splinting: wearing a wrist splint at night can help maintain the wrist in a neutral position, reducing pressure on the median nerve and providing relief from nocturnal symptoms.
•
Activity modification: Identifying and modifying activities that exacerbate symptoms can help in   managing carpal tunnel syndrome. For example, taking frequent breaks during repetitive tasks or adjusting the workstation ergonomics can be beneficial.
•
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): over-the-counter NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, can help manage pain and inflammation associated with carpal tunnel syndrome.
•
corticosteroid injections: In some cases, corticosteroid injections into the carpal tunnel may
provide temporary relief from symptoms by reducing inflammation and pressure on the median nerve.
•
physical and occupational therapy: Therapists can help patients learn exercises to stretch and strengthen the hand and wrist muscles, improving symptoms and function.
If conservative treatments do not provide sufficient relief or the condition worsens, surgical intervention, such as carpal tunnel release surgery, may be considered.",,D,5398-3435.PNG;5435-3472.PNG
Q5,"A child is brought to the orthopedics OPD with a deformity in the lower limb and
hyperpigmented skin lesions. The x-ray of her thigh is shown below. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Non-ossifying fibroma
b)Fibrous dysplasia
c)Paget's disease
d)osteogenesis imperfecta","The above X-ray shows the bending of the femur known as shepherd's crook deformity. It is seen in fibrous dysplasia of proximal femur.
Fibrous dysplasia is a condition that affects bone development and is characterized by
the replacement of the bone with fibrous tissue. The patient presents with a progressive limb
deformity or a fracture through a previously asymptomatic lesion. The presentation often occurs   in the second decade. other symptoms include nonspecific bone pain, tenderness, and swelling in
the affected area. The commonly involved sites are the proximal femur, tibia, pelvis, and foot. polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is associated with Albright-McCune syndrome.
Radiological findings include:
• well-defined, expansile intramedullary lesions
• Hazy ground glass appearance is seen in the majority of cases
• shepherd's crook deformity - Expansion with marked varus in the proximal femur other options:
option A: Non-ossifying fibroma is the commonest variant of giant cell bone tumors. It is a
benign, non-neoplastic lesion most commonly seen in the metaphyses ofthe long bones in
children. Non-ossifying fibromas are usually asymptomatic, and often discovered incidentally on X-rays performed for other reasons. They commonly occur in the metaphyses of long bones and  are characterized by well-defined, eccentric, cortically-based lytic lesions. The X-ray findings in    the question do not match this description.
option C: paget's disease of the bone is a condition where there is an increased bone turnover
followed by enlargement and thickening of the bone. In this condition, calcium levels
are normal with raised ALp. paget's disease typically presents in older adults and affects the axial skeleton, including the pelvis, spine, skull, and femur. It is characterized by increased bone
turnover, leading to disorganized bone remodeling, resulting in enlarged and deformed bones. The X-ray findings and the patient's age do not match the characteristics of paget's disease.
option D: osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disorder characterized by increased bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures. It is associated with blue sclera, dental fragility, and hearing loss. It presents with the hallmark features of osteoporosis with increased fragility of bones along
with blue sclera, dental fragility as well as hearing loss. The X-ray findings in the question do not show the characteristic features of osteogenesis imperfecta, such as thin cortices, multiple
fractures, or wormian bones.",5429-3468.PNG,B,5437-3473.PNG
Q6,The given image is an x-ray of a 22-year-old female. what is the probable diagnosis?,"a)chondroblastoma
b)osteochondroma
c)Giant cell tumor
d)Aneurysmal bone cyst","The given x-ray showing a lytic lesion at the end of a long bone with a soap-bubble appearance suggests a giant cell tumor (GCT) or osteoclastoma.
osteoclastoma usually affects young adults of age 2o to 4o years with a slight female
predominance. It is a benign but locally aggressive tumor. It is exclusively seen in adults and
affects the ends of long bones, involving metaphysis/ epiphysis of long bones. GCT is most
commonly seen in the distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal humerus, and distal radius. Common presenting complaints are swelling and vague pain. sometimes, the patient presents for the first     time with a pathological fracture through the lesion.
Important x-ray features of a GCT:
• A solitary, possibly loculated, lytic lesion in the epiphysis
• Eccentric location, most often subchondral
• Expansion of the overlying cortex
• soap bubble appearance - The tumor is homogeneously lytic with trabeculae of the remnants of bone traversing it, giving it a loculated appearance called soap-bubble appearance.
• No calcification within the tumor
• No or minimal reactive sclerosis around the tumor
Histologically, GCTs consist of undifferentiated spindle cells profusely interspersed
with multi-nucleated giant cells. The tumor stroma is well-vascularized with bands of cellular or collagenous fibrous tissue. The image below shows the histopathology of osteoclastoma.





The treatment of choice for GCT is extended curettage and bone grafting.
• GCT in the relatively insignificant bone like the distal ulna, clavicle, and proximal fibula is treated by resection without reconstruction.
• Bisphosphonates have been shown to reduce the proliferation of osteoclasts and hence have been shown to stabilize local and metastatic disease.
• Radiation can be used for spinal or sacral tumors.
other options:
option A: Chondroblastoma is a benign tumor that usually appears as well-circumscribed round    or oval lytic lesions in the center of the epiphysis of a long bone. It presents as a painful mass that causes effusion or stiffness. It is most commonly seen in ages 1o-2o years.
The following is an x-ray image of the knee showing chondroblastoma:




option B: osteochondromas are common benign bone tumors commonly present in adolescents. The lesions consist of a bony mass, often in the form of a stalk, produced by endochondral
ossification of a growing cartilaginous cap. They are usually painless. The common sites of involvement are the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus.
The following is an x-ray image of the knee showing osteochondroma of the distal knee:


option D: Aneurysmal bone cyst is a tumor that affects all age groups but generally occurs more commonly in adolescents with an equal male: female distribution. It usually occurs in
the metaphysis of long bones (like femur and tibia) and the posterior elements of vertebral bodies.
patients usually present with pain and swelling. Radiographically, ABC is seen as an eccentric, expansile, lytic lesion with well-defined margins.
The following is an x-ray image of the knee showing ABC:
