Q1,what is triage used for?,"a)To prepare for a disaster
b)To asess the impact of a disaster
c)To classify priority of treatment
d)To rehabilitate following a disaster","Triage is used to classify the priority of treatment.
Triage is carried out at the site of a disaster to determine the priority for immediate medical
attention, transportation, and hospital admission. This process involves the rapid classification of the injured based on the severity of their injuries and the likelihood of survival with timely
medical intervention.
Its objective is to provide maximum benefit to the largest number of injured individuals in a
disaster situation. victims whose prognosis would be favorable with simple medical care are given higher priority, while patients in critical condition, who may not benefit significantly from medical attention, are given lower priority. An internationally accepted four-colour coded is commonly
used, which includes:
• Red - High priority attention or tranfer
• yellow - Medium priority
• Green - Ambulatory patients
• Black - Dead or moribund patients

• Hirschsprung's disease - Rectal biopsy
• Posterior urethral valve - Micturating cystourethrogram
• Choledochal cyst - MRCP
• Intussusception - CT scan
Hirschsprung's disease:
• Rectal biopsy is the gold standard investigation for the diagnosis of Hirschsprung’s disease. The affected part shows the absence of ganglion cells, hypertrophy of nerve trunks, and positive
immunostaining for acetylcholinesterase.
• water-soluble contrast enema: It shows the presence of a contracted aganglionic rectum, transition zone, and a dilated normally innervated colon.
• Anorectal manometry: It shows the failure of the relaxation of the internal anal sphincter.
surgical intervention is the only definitive treatment available, and includes the swenson, Duhamel, and soave procedures.

posterior urethral valve (puv):
• Diagnosis of this condition is commonly made during the antenatal period with an ultrasound,  which demonstrates bilateral hydronephrosis above a distended bladder. pulmonary hypoplasia  secondary to oligohydramnios may be detected in some complicated cases. In cases that are not   detected during the antenatal period, these children usually present with urinary infection in the neonatal period or with uremia and renal failure.
• The confirmatory investigation for puv is a micturating/voiding cystourethrogram. It demonstrates poor bladder emptying and dilated posterior urethra.
• It is treated by cystoscopic resection or ablation of the valve.
preoperative(a) and postoperative(b) micturating cystourethrogram images in a patient with puv is shown below. The dilated posterior urethra seen in the first image is resolved in the second
image after surgery.


choledochal cyst:



• MRI/MRCP is highly useful to access the biliary anatomy especially the relation between the lower end of the bile duct and the pancreatic duct.
• Ultrasound is helpful to identify the presence of an abnormal cyst.
• CT scan can be used to delineate the extent of intrahepatic or extrahepatic dilatation MRCP image showing multiple intrahepatic biliary duct cystic dilatations-


Intussusception:
CT scan is the investigation of choice. It may show the characteristic target sign. USG findings in intussusception include:
• Target sign (also known as the doughnut sign)
• Pseudokidney sign
• Crescent in a doughnut sign
Barium enema shows the characteristic coiled spring appearance.

Q3,"A mother notices a swelling in the abdomen of her 3-year-old child while bathing him. He had a history of hematuria two weeks back which resolved spontaneously. on examination, a
right-sided reniform ballotable mass was found. what all investigations will you do?","a)1 and 2
b)2 and 4
c)1, 2, and 3
d)1, 2, 3 and 4","The clinical features of hematuria and a ballotable renal mass in a 3-year-old child are suggestive of wilms tumor (Nephroblastoma). CECT abdomen is used to identify the extent of the tumor,     integrity of the other kidney, and metastasis. wilms tumor is metabolically active and can
concentrate fluorodeoxyglucose therefore PET/CT is also helpful to identify regional spread and metastatic lesions. A biopsy is discouraged as it may lead to disease upstaging. 24-hour urinary  vanillyl mandelic acid is measured to exclude neuroblastoma, which is an important differential diagnosis of wilms tumor.
wilms tumor is the most common primary malignant renal tumor in children, typically affecting children less than 5 years. After neuroblastoma, it is the second most common malignant
abdominal tumor in childhood. It most commonly presents as an asymptomatic abdominal mass. other findings include hypertension, abdominal pain, gross painless hematuria, and
constitutional symptoms such as fever and weight loss.
Imaging studies done to diagnose wilms tumor include plain radiography, USG, and CT of the
abdomen to demonstrate the renal mass. USG with doppler study of renal veins is useful in the
evaluation of collecting system and to look for tumor thrombi in renal veins and inferior vena
cava. A chest CT is done preoperatively to screen for pulmonary metastasis. A positron emission   tomography (PET) scan is useful in identifying regional spread and metastatic lesions. A biopsy is discouraged in this condition as it results in disease upstaging, and is considered only in cases of  unusual presentation or imaging.
Neuroblastoma is an important differential diagnosis to consider, as it can present similarly to     wilms tumor. It is usually seen in preschool-aged children and commonly presents as a palpable abdominal mass. The retroperitoneum is the most common site for this tumor. Therefore, it is
essential to test for elevated vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA) in the urine in this patient to rule out neuroblastoma.
Children's oncology group (previously known as National wilms Tumor study group) staging system for wilms tumor:



Treatment: surgery and chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy, are the mainstays of
treatment.
• Radical nephrectomy is the standard surgical procedure done. Routine sampling of the para-aortic, hilar, and paracaval lymph nodes should be done.
• Nephron-sparing nephrectomy is done for children with bilateral disease or with a solitary kidney. Preoperative chemotherapy can be used in these cases to induce tumor shrinkage.
• The classical chemotherapy includes vincristine and dactinomycin with the addition of Adriamycin(Doxorubicin).

stage I	Tumour confined to the kidn  ey and completely resected w ith negative lymph nodes.
stage I I	Tumour extends beyond the   kidney but is completely rese cted with negative margins a  nd lymph nodes.
stage I II	Residual tumour present foll  owing surgery confined to th  e abdomen, including gross o r microscopic tumour.

Q4,"A 26-year-old male presented with a large, round, firm, painless, right-sided testicular
swelling associated with a dragging sensation. The left testis was normal. AFP was around 3ooou. what is the next best step in the management?","a)FNAC
b)Scrotal trucut biopsy
c)High inguinal orchidectomy
d)Repeat tumor markers","The clinical features of a male patient presenting with a large, round, firm, and painless testicular mass with elevated AFP levels are suggestive of a non-seminomatous germ cell tumor (NsGCT).    Among the given options, a high inguinal orchidectomy would be the next best step in the
management.
An ultrasound scan (UsG) of the testis is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis of a testicular tumor and assess the contralateral testis. since UsG is not given as an option, the next best step in this    scenario would be a high inguinal orchidectomy. FNAC and trucut biopsy are contraindicated due  to risk of seeding of the scrotrum and upstaging of the cancer.
Radical inguinal orchiectomy is the gold standard treatment for excision of the primary tumor. sperm cryopreservation should be offered before surgery.
After removal of the affected testis, a metastatic workup is done with CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to stage the disease as follows:
• stage I: Localized tumor with no lymph node involvement or distant metastasis



• Stage II: Regional lymph node metastasis
• Stage III: Distant metastasis or nodal metastasis with elevated tumor markers
Further management is based on staging with treatment options including active surveillance,   combination chemotherapy with bleomycin-etoposide-cisplatin and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.",,C,
Q5,"A woman who had undergone cholecystectomy presented three days after the surgery with
abdominal pain and tachycardia. wBC count is 11ooo cells/mm3. USG showed fluid collection 5x5 cm in right sub-hepatic space. what is the next step in management?","a)Antibiotics and send home
b)USG guided pigtail catheter drainage
c)Laparoscopy and re-exploration
d)ERCP and T-tube placement","This clinical scenario involves a patient presenting with abdominal pain and tachycardia in the
post-operative period  following cholecystectomy. An ultrasound scan (USG) reveals a fluid
collection in the right sub-hepatic space, strongly suggesting a bile duct injury following
cholecystectomy. As the patient presents more than 48 hours after the surgery, the next best step in managament would be to drain the fluid collection using a USG-guided pigtail catheter.
More than 8o% of bile duct injuries occur during cholecystectomy. A bile duct injury can result in either bile leakage or stricture. patients with bile leakage may present with fever, increasing
abdominal pain, jaundice or bile leakage from an incision.


Management strategy:
• Imaging: Ultrasonography to assess for a fluid collection and to evaluate the biliary tree
• Control of infection, limiting inflammation
• percutaneous drainage of periportal fluid collections
• parenteral antibiotics
• Clear and thorough delineation of entire biliary anatomy
• Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCp), especially if cystic-duct stump leak is suspected. It is both diagnostic and therapeutic.
• Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCp)



• HIDA scanning is also helpful to identify and quantitate bile leaks.
• Definitive surgical correction
• Roux-en-y choledochojejunostomy can be done for benign strictures or duct transections.
• Balloon dilatation with placement of a stent can be done for strictures of recent onset.",,B,4882-3040.PNG;4883-3042.PNG
Q6,The instrument shown in the image is used to insufflate the abdomen for laparoscopic surgery. what is its name?,"a)veress needle
b)Lind's needle
c)Jacob needle
d)Mathew needle","The instrument shown in the image is the veress needle which is used to insufflate the abdomen for laparoscopic surgery.
The image below shows the veress needle:


There are two methods for establishing abdominal access during laparoscopic surgeries:



• Direct puncture using a veress needle
• Direct peritoneal access (Hasson's technique) Direct puncture laparoscopy:
In this procedure, first, the abdominal wall is grasped with towel clips or fingers to elevate it away from the underlying structures. Then, a small incision is made in the umbilicus, and insufflation is performed using a veress needle. when introducing the veress needle, two distinct pops can be
felt as the needle pierces the abdominal wall fascia first and then the peritoneum. The umbilicus is the preferred location for introducing a veress needle because the abdominal wall is thinner at
this site.


Laparoscopic surgeries can be performed under general anesthesia or local anesthesia; although, general anesthesia is preferred. carbon dioxide gas is usually used for insufflation, and the
maximum pressure is typically in the range of 14-15 mm Hg. However, if the procedure is done under local anesthesia, nitrous oxide is used. Insufflation with nitrous oxide is stopped at a
pressure of 1o mmHg or when 2L of gas has been insufflated.
Direct peritoneal access technique (Hasson technique): The surgeon makes a small umbilical    incision and gains access to the peritoneal cavity under direct vision by dissecting through the abdominal fascia and peritoneum. It is preferred in patients who have undergone previous
abdominal operations where the small bowel may be adherent to the undersurface of the abdominal wound.",4866-3031.PNG,A,4883-3041.PNG;4884-3043.PNG
Q7,"A 2o-year-old was brought to the ER after falling off his bicycle. His vitals were stable, but he had a bruise over the perineum and he had not passed urine yet. Blood was seen at the
meatus and the bladder was not palpable. How do you manage him?","a)wait and send him home
b)Immediate insertion of foleys catheter
c)Suprapubic aspiration of urine
d)wait for bladder to fill and urge to urinate","The clinical features of a perineal bruise and blood at the urethral meatus following a fall from a bicycle are suggestive of a bulbar urethral injury. In this case, since the bladder is not palpable,   the best option would be to wait for the bladder to fill and for the urge to urinate to occur. once  the bladder is full, the urine should be drained using a suprapubic catheter.
The image given below shows the various parts of the urethra:

Q10,"A 55-year-old female patient presented with a 4x3 cm lump in the right upper outer quadrant, with no axillary lymph node involvement. Mammography revealed BIRADS 4b staging. She
underwent breast conservation surgery, and the final HPE report showed high nuclear grade DCIS with necrosis and 1o mm margin clearance. what is the further management?","a)Adjuvant radiotherapy
b)Adjuvant chemotherapy
c)Follow up 6 monthly for 2 years and then yearly follow up
d)Trastuzumab therapy","The next step in the management in this patient with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) would be adjuvant radiotherapy, according to the University of Southern California/Van Nuys Prognostic Index (USC/VNPI).
The USC/VNPI  is a scoring system that evaluates the following four factors to predict recurrence in patients with DCIS who are undergoing conservative treatment:
• Tumor size



• Margin width
• Pathological classification (based on nuclear grade, and presence or absence of comedonecrosis)
• Age
This index also provides recommendations for managing patients based on the calculated score. scoring system for UsC/VNPI:
The current recommendations for the management of DCIs according to this index are:
• Excision alone for scores 4,5, and 6
• Excision plus radiotherapy for scores 7,8, and 9
• Mastectomy for scores 1o,11, and 12 In this case,
• Tumor size of 4cm (4omm) - score 2
• 1o mm margin clearance - score 1
• High nuclear grade with necrosis - score 3
• Age of 55 years - score 2
The total score is 8; hence radiotherapy is indicated after breast conservation surgery.

Q11,"A lady presents with abdominal pain. USG reveals multiple gall stones with no wall
thickening. CBD diameter is 12 mm and serum bilirubin was o.8. Alkaline phosphatase is 38o and GGT is raised by 5 times. what is the next best step of management?","a)MRCP
b)ERCP
c)Endoscopic ultrasound
d)Laparoscopic cholecystectomy","In this clinical scenario, a patient with gallstones, a dilated common bile duct, and an elevated
alkaline phosphatase level raises suspicion for common bile duct stones. The next best step would be to perform magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to confirm their presence.   A dilated common bile duct (&gt;8 mm) detected on ultrasound in a patient with gallstones,
jaundice, biliary pain and an abnormal liver function panel (elevated bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, and transaminases; but these can be normal in some cases) strongly indicates the presence of common bile duct stones (choledocholithiasis).
If there is uncertainty regarding the presence of bile duct stones, as in this case where bilirubin    levels are normal, MRCP offers precise anatomical visualization and exhibits high sensitivity and



specificity for diagnosing choledocholithiasis.
while endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is also highly effective in
diagnosing choledocholithiasis, due to its invasive nature and the risks associated with the
procedure, it is rarely used as a purely diagnostic modality. Instead, it is reserved for cases in which a therapeutic intervention, such as stone extraction or sphincterotomy, is planned.
Treatment options:
• ERCP along with sphincterotomy and stone removal.
• Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration
• open common bile duct exploration is only done when endoscopic and laparoscopic methods are not feasible or when concomitant biliary drainage is needed.",,A,
Q12,You are suturing a laceration in the ER using the interrupted suturing technique. what is the angle of needle placement?,"a)6o degrees
b)7o degrees
c)8o degrees
d)9o degrees","In the interrupted suture technique, the needle is placed at an angle of 9o degrees (at right angles).
Interrupted sutures:
The needle should be inserted and exit the skin at right angles. It should be rotated through the   tissue rather than dragged to prevent unnecessary enlargement of the needle hole. The distance   from the suture entry point to the wound edge should be approximately equal to the depth of the sutured tissue. There should be twice this distance between two consecutive sutures.
The image below shows interrupted suture:


other suturing techniques:
Continuous suture: The first suture is inserted in a manner identical to that in an interrupted
suture. The remaining sutures are inserted in a continuous manner until the far end of the wound is reached. Care should be taken to maintain the tension of the suture to avoid excessive tension



or leaving it too slack; hence, the use of an assistant is warranted. An Aberdeen knot is used to secure the end of the suture.


Mattress sutures - They can be vertical or horizontal and are used to create either an eversion or inversion of the wound edges. The initial suture is inserted in the same way as an interrupted
suture, but then, the needle either moves horizontally or vertically and traverses both edges of the wound once again, as seen in the image below. The main advantage of the mattress suture is that  it produces an accurate approximation of wound edges, especially in settings where the edges are  not easily approximated.


subcuticular sutures: It is used for a better cosmetic appearance. It is also employed in situations where the edges of the wound are easily approximated. In this technique, small bites of the
subcuticular tissues are taken on alternate sites of the wound, and then, they are gently pulled
together. This causes an approximation of the wound edges without the risk of the cross-hatched markings of interrupted sutures.",,D,4888-3046.PNG;4889-3048.PNG;4889-3047.PNG;4890-3049.PNG
Q13,A 26-year-old male patient was brought to the emergency department with abdominal pain and obstipation for 3 days. He gives a history of bull gore to the abdomen 3 days back. His  X-ray is given below. what is the probable diagnosis?,"a)Hemothorax
b)Hollow viscus perforation
c)pneumothorax
d)Intestinal obstruction","The given clinical scenario involves a patient with a history of penetrating abdominal trauma and presenting symptoms of abdominal pain and obstipation. The erect radiograph shows air under    the diaphragm which strongly points to a diagnosis of hollow viscous perforation.
perforation of the alimentary tract is a life-threatening condition. This leads to the leakage of the enteric contents, thereby leading to acute bacterial peritonitis. peritonitis is the generalized or
localized inflammation of the peritoneum either due to the free spillage of fluids into the peritoneal cavity or secondary bacterial infection.
Clinical features include abdominal pain and distension, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia,
tenderness, rebound tenderness, decreased or absent bowel sounds, and guarding on palpation. Fever may be present. Features of septic shock can be seen at later stages.
Investigations include estimation of the white blood cell count, urea, serum electrolytes, and an
erect abdominal radiograph showing free gas under the diaphragm. A supine radiograph may
show dilated gas-filled loops of the bowel suggestive of paralytic ileus. However, CECT is the most sensitive investigation to detect minimal/ suspected pneumoperitoneum.





Management of a hollow viscous perforation mainly includes resuscitation, analgesics, intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, and emergency exploratory laparotomy.
other options:
option A- Hemothorax appears as a homogenous increase in opacity of the hemithorax.


option C- pneumothorax is the collection of air in the pleural space. on radiography, there may be increased lucency on the affected side, depression of the affected hemidiaphragm, and
mediastinal shift to the opposite side. Associated rib fractures might also be visible.





option D- Intestinal obstruction
• In small bowel obstruction, the obstructed bowel loops are centrally located and lie transversely. In cases of jejunal obstruction, valvulae conniventes, which are mucosal folds that span the entire diameter of the bowel, create a ladder effect. Additionally, a distended cecum may exhibit a gas
shadow in the right iliac fossa.


• In large bowel obstruction, the presence of haustrations is a characteristic feature. Haustral folds are irregular and do not extend across the entire diameter of the bowel. However, it is important    to note that haustral folds are absent in the caecum.",4869-3033.PNG,B,4891-3051.PNG;4891-3050.PNG;4892-3053.PNG;4893-3054.PNG
Q14,"A man presented with a history of stab injury over the arm. on examination, there was a  hematoma present, and radial and ulnar pulses were not felt. A 3.5cm longitudinal tear is noted in the brachial artery. which among the following is the best treatment option?","a)primary repair with end to end anastomosis
b)Repair with great saphenous vein graft
c)Repair with prosthetic graft
d)Repair with saphenous vein patch","In this patient, who has sustained a long tear to the brachial artery due to a stab injury, the best    treatment option is to repair it with a great saphenous vein interposition graft harvested from the patient's uninjured leg.
The most desirable graft used is the great saphenous vein . A native vein graft is preferable to a prosthetic graft because:
• Its elastic properties are comparable to that of an artery and enable pulsatile flow
• The diameter is similar to that of an extremity artery
• It is not thrombogenic and has long term patency
other grafts that can be used are cephalic vein, lesser saphenous vein, and prosthetic
conduits. Cephalic vein is not the first choice because it is less muscular than greater saphenous vein, and might also compromise the upper limb venous access in the already injured patient.
Both the cephalic and the lesser saphenous veins present problems while harvesting in a trauma patient.
other options:
option A: primary arterial repair with end-to-end anastomosis can be done only if the repair is
tension-free. If the length of the injured area is long, vessel injuries cannot be repaired by primary end-to-end anastomoses and instead require an interposition graft.
option C: prosthetic grafts are only preferred when there has been a trauma to the native saphenous vein or when there is a size mis-match. polytetrafluoroethylene (pTFE) graft is commonly used.
option D: saphenous vein patch is used in the closure of the arteriotomy site during carotid endarterectomies.",,B,
Q15,"A 24-year old male patient was brought to the emergency department following a road traffic accident. His heart rate was 1oo/min, respiratory rate was 24/min, and his chest X-ray is
given below. which of the following is contraindicated in him?","a)Nasogastric tube insertion
b)chest tube insertion
c)Log roll
d)Epidural anaesthesia","The given radiograph shows elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic line along with the bowel
loops and stomach seen in the pleural cavity. The probable cause would be a diaphragmatic hernia following blunt injury due to a road traffic accident. chest tube insertion is contraindicated in
diaphragmatic hernia due to risk of injury to bowel.
chest tube insertion/thoracostomy is indicated cases of pneumothorax, hemothorax, chylothorax, pleural effusion, and pleural empyema. contraindications include pulmonary adhesions,
pulmonary trauma, coagulopathy, and diaphragmatic hernia.
chest radiography performed after the placement of a nasogastric tube can be helpful in
identifying any herniation of the stomach into the chest. Log roll and epidural anesthesia are not contraindicated in diaphragmatic hernia.
Blunt trauma to the diaphragm results in a linear diaphragmatic rupture, which is typically large and accompanied by the herniation of abdominal contents into the chest. Acute diaphragmatic     injuries require repair through the abdominal approach to address associated visceral injuries.    The diaphragmatic edges are approximated using Allis clamps, and the defect is closed with a
running 1-0 polypropylene suture.",4869-3033-1.png,B,
Q16,"A patient was received in the casualty following a road traffic accident. His BP was 9o/6o

Q17,The most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in a male child is,"a)Posterior urethral valve
b)urethral atresia
c)Anterior urethral valve
d)ureterocele","The most common cause of bladder outflow obstruction in a male child is the posterior urethral valve (Puv).
A Puv is a membranous fold in the posterior urethra which results from the persistence of the   urogenital membrane. It is typically located just distal to the verumontanum and is the primary cause of bladder outlet obstruction in newborn males.
Diagnosis is most commonly made antenatally with ultrasound which demonstrates bilateral
hydronephrosis, a distended bladder, and a dilated posterior urethra which appears as the keyhole sign on imaging. In severe cases, there is oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia during the    antenatal period.





If the diagnosis is not made antenatally, then babies typically present with urinary tract infections in the neonatal period or with uraemia and renal failure. clinically, a poor urinary stream,
dribbling of urine, and palpable bladder (due to diverticula) can be present.
The investigation of choice is micturating cystourethrography.
The diagnosis is best made during the micturition phase of micturating cystourethrography in lateral or oblique views so that the posterior urethra can be imaged adequately. The following  findings are seen:
• Dilatation and elongation of the posterior urethra - equivalent of the ultrasonographic keyhole sign
• Linear radiolucent band corresponding to the valve - seen occasionally
• vesicoureteral reflux - seen in 5o% of patients
• Bladder trabeculation/diverticula




Treatment is initially supportive by inserting a urinary catheter to relieve symptoms of
obstruction. Definitive treatment is by urethroscopic destruction of the valves with continuing
lifelong supportive treatment of the dilated urinary tract, recurrent urinary infections and uremia.
other options:
options B and C- urethral atresia and anterior urethral valve are rare congenital anomalies that can also lead to urinary obstruction.
option D- ureterocele is the cystic enlargement of the intramural ureter. It is common in females. They can present with features of urinary tract infection, bladder obstruction, or ureteral stones.   Excretion urography will show cobra head appearance.

Q18,which of the following statements are true about colon cancer?,"a)1, 2, and 3 only
b)2, 3, and 4 only
c)2 and 4 only
d)1, 2, 3 and 4","All the 4 given statements on colon cancer are true:
• Right and left colon cancers present differently. Left-sided tumors commonly cause obstruction and present with changes in bowel habits or rectal bleeding. on the other hand, right-sided
tumors typically present with iron deficiency anemia or a mass.
• while the majority of colorectal cancers occur sporadically, hereditary cases are also seen in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer. Genetic testing aids in early diagnosis for    individuals with a positive family history.
• Metformin, a commonly used biguanide compound for diabetes mellitus, reduces the risk of
cancer, including colorectal cancer. It achieves this by disrupting cellular energy supply through the inhibition of aerobic glycolysis.
• Liver is the most frequent site of distant metastasis for colorectal cancer, with metastases
occurring via the portal venous system. The risk of hepatic metastasis increases with tumor size and grade. The lung is the second most common site of distant metastasis, also due to
hematogenous spread. Carcinomatosis (diffuse peritoneal metastases) results from peritoneal



seeding.
Note: Regional lymph node involvement is the most common form of spread of colorectal carcinoma and usually precedes distant metastasis.",,D,
Q19,Frozen section was done during the surgery of carcinoma breast. This procedure will be useful for all except,"a)To know sentinel lymph node
b)To know margin positivity
c)To know metastasis
d)To confirm definitive diagnosis immediately in all cases","Frozen section analysis performed during breast carcinoma surgery is not suitable for definitive   diagnosis due to technical challenges, potential quality issues in processing and staining, and the difficulty of obtaining accurate results.
Frozen section analysis is performed when a prompt biopsy report is required, allowing the surgeon to make immediate decisions regarding the further steps of management.
• Frozen section analysis plays a valuable role in assessing involvement of sentinel lymph nodes during surgery (option A). when a positive node is identified intraoperatively, the surgeon can   proceed with immediate axillary lymph node clearance. on the other hand, if the sentinel node  does not show tumor involvement, further axillary dissection can be avoided.
• It also helps in diagnosing nodal metastasis in clinically identified lymph nodes (option C).

Q20,"A 4o-year-old woman presented with jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain. she is suspected to have cholangitis. which of the following apart from abdominal pain makes up Reynold's
pentad?","a)1,2,3,4
b)2,3,4,5
c)1,3,4,5
d)1,2,4,5","Apart from abdominal pain, 1, 2, 3, and 4 form the Reynold's pentad which is seen in
severe cholangitis.
The components of Reynold's pentad are:
• Right upper quadrant abdominal pain
• Fever
• Jaundice
• Hypotension
• Altered sensorium
Cholangitis is the infection of the common bile duct (CBD) secondary to obstruction and increased intraluminal pressure due to CBD stones. Cholangitis presents with the classical triad of fever,
right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice, referred to as Charcot's triad. It is a medical emergency and if left untreated, it may progress in severity and presents with Reynold's pentad - Charcot's    triad with hypotension and altered mental status due to sepsis.
Abdominal ultrasound is performed to check for the presence ofbiliary stones and bile duct
dilatations. The patient should be started immediately on a first-line broad-spectrum antibiotic
and rehydration, along with biliary drainage. Biliary drainage is done using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Biliary stones are the cause of cholangitis the majority of the



time, which can be removed by endoscopic sphincterotomy during ERcP.",,A,
Q21,The following drain is placed after mastectomy. Identify the type of drain.,"a)open
b)Closed
c)semi open
d)semi closed","The Romo vac drain, depicted in the image, is a closed type of drain commonly used after mastectomy.
Drains are placed at surgical sites to freely collect the air or fluids that may accumulate. This enhances wound healing by preventing the formation of unnecessary cavities. Drains are
prophylactic in elective surgeries and therapeutic in emergency surgeries. Drains can be -
• open - They are based on the principle of gravity
• semi-open - Their action is based on capillary effect
• closed - They carry out their actions through suction
suction drains are commonly used in chest, breast, abdominal, thyroid, and plastic surgeries.
They remove intraperitoneal secretions, anastomotic leaks, and blood from hemorrhage at the  surgical site. Romo vac drain is a negative suction drain closed drain kept in the subcutaneous tissue. Romo vac drain is indicated in modified radical mastectomy, subcutaneous swelling
excision, and amputations.
special types of drains:
• chest drains are connected to an underwater seal to aid the exit of air from the pleural cavity. They are used in pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and hemothorax.
• After surgical exploration of the bile duct, the sphincter of oddi goes into spasm. To facilitate drainage of bile, a T tube may be used.
Drain insertion site care: The site of insertion of the drain is kept clean by drying and patting the drain insertion site with a clean towel after bath. The dressing is changed daily with folded gauze pieces placed below and above the drain site.
Removal of drains: The catheter at the site is milked for residual collections. It is then clamped    and the suture holding the catheter is cut. The tube is then gently pulled out and any clots at the perforation end are removed. The time of removal of drains for various conditions is as given
below.
• Drains used in surgeries like thyroidectomy are usually removed within 24 hours. Their main purpose is to cover postoperative bleeding.
• In a mastectomy, a drain is placed for 5 days to collect serous collections.
• Drains used to cover the colorectal anastomoses are placed for 5-7 days.
• common bile duct T-tube drains are usually placed for 1o days.
• Drains for infections are removed when the infection subsides or when the content of the drain is minimal.
After the drain is removed, a folded gauze is placed over the drain insertion area. The dressing can be removed after 24 hours. The patient may be given an antibiotic ointment to apply over the area for a week.",4873-3035.PNG,B,
Q22,Consider the following about hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and choose the correct statements.,"a)1, 2, 3
b)2, 3, 4
c)1, 3, 4
d)1 and 2 only","The correct statements about hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are 1,3 and 4. Lenvatinib is used in the advanced stages of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
HCC is the most common cause of primary liver cancer. It is more commonly seen in males and the peak age group is between 65-7o years. The main risk factor for HCC is cirrhosis and
associated chronic liver damage due to chronic infection by hepatitis B or C virus (HBV or HCV) infection, alcohol abuse, metabolic syndrome, or hemochromatosis.
The incidence of HCC is increasing (statement 3) worldwide. This is contributed by the increase in HCV and HBV infections, along with lifestyle disorders like obesity. obesity is associated with
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This progresses on to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NAsH) causing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, NAsH and NAFLD are risk factors of HCC (statement 4).
Barcelona-Clinic-Liver Cancer (BCLC) Classification is the commonly used staging system. It stages the tumors as follows:
• Very early HCC - single, well-differentiated tumor &lt;2cm
• Early HCC - single tumor or a maximum of 3 nodules &lt;3cm in diameter
• Intermediate HCC - Any other size or number confined to the liver
• Advanced HCC - Presence of cancer-related symptoms or tumors with macrovascular invasion   (of any type, including branch, hepatic, or portal vein), lymph node involvement, or extrahepatic spread
• End-stage disease - severe liver dysfunction with impaired quality of life
Treatment
Very early HCC is treated by ablation. Early HCC with a single nodule is resected but when there are multiple nodules over 3 cm, ablation or transplantation are considered.
Intermediate stage HCC is treated by chemoembolization. Transarterial
chemoembolization(TACE) is used for multinodular lesions (statement 1).
Advanced stages of the disease with macrovascular invasion are treated with systemic therapies.  Lenvatinib and sorafenib are first-line drugs. supportive care is given at the terminal stage of the disease.",,C,
Q23,"A 56-year-old patient with obstructive jaundice has a distended gall bladder and a dilated
common bile duct and intrahepatic biliary radicles on ultrasound. Contrast-enhanced CT
confirmed the same findings with no additional findings. which of the following will be most useful to localize the cause?","a)Magnetic resonance imaging
b)Endoscopic ultrasound
c)percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography
d)Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","The given clinical scenario with UsG and CECT showing a distended gall bladder, dilated common bile duct, and intrahepatic biliary radicles raises suspicion of common bile duct stones (CBD
stones). Among the given options, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI/MRCP) will be next most useful modality to localize the cause and level of obstruction.



Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) uses T2-weighted MRI sequences and it is highly sensitive and specific in identifying CBD stones. MRCP provides visualization of dilated
bile ducts and often enables accurate assessment of the level of occlusion in the biliary tree. It is a non-invasive test and is preferred by many surgeons to assess the need for endoscopic retrograde  cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). ERCP is also highly effective at diagnosing CBD stones.
However, due to the risks associated with the procedure, it is rarely used as a purely diagnostic modality, rather it is now used only as a therapeutic modality such as when stone extraction or sphincterotomy is planned (option D).
Ultrasonography (USG) can detect gallstones and assess the size of the common bile duct. If a
patient with gallstones, jaundice, and biliary pain shows a dilated common bile duct (&gt;8 mm in diameter) on USG, it strongly suggests the presence of CBD stones. CT scan is also a sensitive
diagnostic tool for CBD stones. USG and CT will generally be the first line modalities due to their easier availability, and lower cost and time requirements.


other options:
option B- Endoscopic ultrasound is used for detecting CBD stones. It is considered as good as   ERCP but it is invasive and requires expertise in endoscopic procedure and hence it is not done routinely.
option C- Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) is rarely performed in patients with CBD stones. In patients where endoscopic or surgical procedures are contraindicated, it may be   used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.",,A,4900-3058.PNG;4901-3059.PNG
Q24,All of the following are lower urinary tract symptoms except,"a)Sudden urge to urinate
b)Incontinence while asleep
c)Incontinence when patient lies down and coughs
d)Incontinence during intercourse","Incontinence during intercourse is not a lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS).
The lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) can be classified as:
Storage LUTS: This occurs due to the failure of the bladder to act as a urine reservoir. It is
commonly seen in the overactive bladder or bladder neuropathy. Symptoms related to storage LUTS are:
• Frequency - Increased frequency of voiding
• Nocturia - a patient has to wake up at least once at night to void
• Urgency (option A) - the sudden uncontrollable desire to pass urine
• Urge incontinence - a large volume of involuntary urine leakage preceded by urgency
• Stress incontinence (option C) - dribbling of urine during coughing, laughing, sneezing, or exercising. This occurs in women who have undergone vaginal deliveries.
• Nocturnal enuresis (option B) - involuntary leakage of urine during sleep. It is commonly seen in elderly men having chronic retention of urine with overflow incontinence.
• Strangury - is a sensation of constantly needing to void. Commonly occurs due to a lower urinary tract infection.
voiding LUTS: This is commonly seen in bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). Symptoms related to voiding LUTS are:
• Hesitancy - difficulty in initiating micturition
• Reduced stream
• Straining - muscular effort is needed to initiate or to improve the urinary stream



post micturitional LUTS: This is also caused due to BOO. Symptoms related to post micturitional LUTS are:
• Incomplete emptying - a sensation that the bladder is full still remains after micturition
• post micturition dribble - Involuntary passage of urine after the patient has finished passing urine.",,D,
Q25,Fluorescence in-situ hybridization(FISH) is required in which of the following IHC interpretations of Her2/neu?,"a)1+
b)2+
c)3+
d)All of the above","Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for gene amplification should be performed in all cases of breast tumors with an immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 2+.
HER2/neu is a protein promoting rapid growth of breast cancer cells. All invasive breast cancers show undergo HER2/neu testing on biopsy or post-surgical removal. HER2 status is crucial for
guiding breast cancer treatment. Two tests, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ  hybridization (FISH), determine the presence of high HER2 protein levels. As FISH is costlier and more time-consuming, IHC is often performed as the initial test.
Her-2/neu IHC interpretation:
• o to 1+: Negative for HER2. These cancers do not respond to drugs targetting HER2 receptors.
• 2+: Equivocal. Hence, further testing with FISH is required to clarify the HER2 status.
• 3+: positive for HER2. These cancers respond to drugs targetting HER2 receptors.
Transtuzumab and pertuzumab are monoclonal antibodies specifically used for
HER2/neu-positive tumors.",,B,
Q26,A 5o-year-old male patient came to the outpatient department with complaints of hematuria.  A 2x2 cm bladder mass is seen which is a low-grade transitional cell carcinoma. which among the following is the ideal management?,"a)Transurethral resection of the tumour
b)Resection with ileal conduit
c)partial cystectomy with bladder reconstruction
d)Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy","This patient with low-grade 2x2 cm bladder cancer is likely to have non-muscle invasive bladder carcinoma (NMIBC) should undergo transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) for    accurate staging purposes.
Bladder cancer is graded (G1/2/3) based on level of differentiation. NMIBC includes stages Tis (in-situ), Ta (non-invasive papillary carcinoma), and T1 (invades lamina propria) while muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) includes stages T2 (invades muscularis propria), T3 (invades
perivesicular soft tissue), and T4 (invades adfjacent organs). NMIBC accounts for almost 7o% of cases at presentation.
Treatment:
• NMIBC - The initial management of bladder tumors consists of transurethral resection of
bladder tumor (TURBT) for accurate staging, which aids in determining the subsequent treatment plan. Intravesical therapy, involving chemotherapy (with mitomycin, doxorubicin, or epirubicin)    or immunotherapy (BCG), is administered after TURBT to eradicate any remaining cancer cells.    This therapy primarily targets the bladder lining and is not effective for cancers that have invaded deeper layers.



• MIBC - The standard treatment for muscle-invasive tumors is radical cystectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy with urinary diversion (ileal conduit) (option B). systemic adjuvant and
neoadjuvant chemotherapy with M-VAC (Methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) has shown to be beneficial (option D).
Option C: partial cystectomy can be attempted in patients with focal bladder cancer, but the risk of recurrence remains high.",,A,
Q27,which of the following statements are true?,"a)2, 3, 4
b)1, 2, 3, 4
c)4 only
d)1, 3, 4","statements 1, 3 and 4 are true.
screening with noninvasive tests for common cancers aims to achieve early diagnosis, enable less invasive surgical treatments with reduced complications, and potentially improve surgical cure
and overall survival rates.
statement 1: Mammography as a routine screening tool has been found to lower breast cancer
mortality at an acceptable cost. In the united kingdom, an expert panel reported a 2o% reduction in breast cancer mortality due to screening, despite the occurrence of overdiagnosis. The panel
recommended continuing breast screening due to its significant benefits.
statement 3: Visual inspection of the oral cavity is widely used for screening oral cancer. The
target population includes individuals aged 3o and above who use tobacco and/or alcohol. Visual inspection is advantageous due to its feasibility, safety, acceptability, accuracy in detecting
precancerous and cancerous lesions, and cost-effectiveness in reducing oral cancer mortality.
statement 4: pap smear is a screening test for cervical cancer. Cervical cancer screening should
start at age 21. women aged 21-29 should have pap smear every 3 years, while women aged 3o-65 should have both HpV and pap co-test every 5 years.
Other statements:
statement 2: American Cancer society guidelines recommend colon cancer screening for average-risk individuals starting at age 5o. screening options include:
• yearly fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) / fecal immunohistochemical testing (FIT)
• Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years,
• FOBT/FIT and flexible sigmoidoscopy in combination every 5 years, or
• Colonoscopy every 1o years.",,D,
Q28,which of the following is the correct method for measurement of nasogastric tube?,"a)Tip of nose to ear lobule to xiphisternum
b)Angle of mouth to tragus to xiphisternum
c)Ala of nose to angle of mandible to xiphisternum
d)Angle of mouth to ear lobule to umbilicus","The correct method for measuring a nasogastric tube (Ryle's tube) is from the tip of the nose to the ear lobule to the xiphisternum.
Nasogastric (NG) tubes play a role in treating intestinal obstruction and can also be used to
provide nutritional support. The commonly used method to determine the length of a nasogastric tube (NG tube) is the NEX method, which involves measuring from the tip of the nose to ear to



xiphisternum. The approximate length to be inserted is 55cms.
Ideally, Ryle's tube is inserted in the sitting position with the neck slightly flexed. confirmation of the correct position is done by the following:
• Auscultation in the epigastric area while injecting a bolus of air
• An abdominal radiograph is the best way to confirm the location of the tube
An NG tube placed for suction should ideally be located within the stomach to avoid potential   damage to the duodenum. For decreased risk of aspiration, the ideal location for an NG tube is postpyloric (55-6ocm).
Indications for NG tube :
Drainage purposes:
• conservative management of bowel obstruction and postop paralytic ileus
• Gastric decompression prior to emergency surgery
• Aspiration of gastric fluid Feeding purposes:
• Nutritional support in patients in motor neuron disease, stroke, and following upper aerodigestive tract procedures
• Administration of medication contraindications:
Absolute:
• severe midface trauma
• Recent nasal surgery Relative:
• coagulation abnormality
• Esophageal varices
• Recent banding of esophageal varices
• Anastomoses in the stomach and esophagus

Q29,A surgeon performs an appendicectomy with a grid iron incision. He later converts the incision to Rutherford Morrison incision. which of the following are cut?,"a)1, 3, 4
b)2, 3, 4
c)1, 2, 3
d)1, 2, 4","The structures cut when the initial incision gridiron incision (McBurney's incision) is converted to the Rutherford Morrison incision are the external oblique, internal oblique, and transverse
abdominis muscles.
when the preoperative diagnosis is reasonably certain, the widely used incision for appendectomy is known as the gridiron incision. It is made perpendicular to a line connecting the anterior
superior iliac spine to the umbilicus, with its center at McBurney's point. when better access is     needed, the gridiron incision can be converted to a Rutherford Morison incision by extending the incision obliquely upwards and laterally.
Rutherford Morison's incision is suitable for a para- or retrocecal appendix that is fixed. It is an
oblique muscle-cutting incision starting from McBurney's point and extending upward and laterally as needed. All layers (skin, subcutaneous tissues, external oblique, internal
oblique, transversus abdominis, and the peritoneum) are divided along the incision line.
In recent years, the transverse skin crease (Lanz) incision has gained popularity due to improved   exposure and ease of extension when necessary. This incision is placed approximately 2 cm below the umbilicus along the midclavicular-midinguinal line, with its length adjusted according to the   patient's size and obesity. If required, the incision can be extended medially by retracting or
dividing the rectus abdominis muscle (statement 4).
when there is uncertainty in the diagnosis, especially in the presence of intestinal obstruction, a lower midline abdominal incision is preferred over a right lower paramedian incision.",,C,4906-3061.PNG
