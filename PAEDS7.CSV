Q1,Two girls in the same class are diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. Their 12-year old    friend from the same school is afraid of contracting the disease. what advice should be given to the exposed students?,"a)Two doses of polysaccharide vaccine
b)Antibiotic prophylaxis
c)Two doses of conjugate vaccine
d)single dose of meningococcal vaccine","Antibiotic prophylaxis is provided to the close contacts of persons with confirmed meningococcal disease.
Close contacts of individuals with confirmed meningococcal disease are at an increased risk of
developing the illness. prophylaxis is also offered to individuals with direct and prolonged contact with a case of meningococcal disease. Antibiotics are effective in preventing additional cases by
eradicating the carriage of the invasive strain.
Treatment is provided to the contacts within 24 hours of identification of the index case. The antibiotics effective include rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.
prophylaxis is not generally recommended for medical personnel, except in cases where there is exposure to aerosols of respiratory secretions, such as during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation,
intubation, or suctioning. This recommendation applies within 24 hours before or after the initiation of antibiotic therapy in the index case.
For the treatment of cases, penicillin is the preferred drug, but ceftriaxone or other
third-generation cephalosporins are recommended for patients with penicillin allergy. Droplet infection control precautions should be followed for hospitalized patients for 24 hours after
effective therapy has been initiated.
offering quadrivalent meningococcal A, C, W, Y conjugate vaccines in addition to antimicrobial
prophylaxis can further reduce the risk of disease among close contacts of cases caused by vaccine capsular groups.
Meningococcal vaccines are available in two forms: polysaccharide vaccines and
polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines. polysaccharide vaccines can be given as a single dose to individuals aged 2 years and older. They are offered in bivalent (A, C), trivalent (A, C, W135),  and quadrivalent (A, C, W135, Y) formulations.
Meningococcal conjugate vaccines are available as monovalent (A or C) or quadrivalent (A, C,
W135, Y) formulations. Conjugate vaccines, which offer increased immunogenicity and potential for herd protection, are preferred over polysaccharide vaccines, especially in children under 2
years of age. Both types of vaccines are safe to use during pregnancy.",,B,
Q2,"A laborer's second child is brought to the OPD with a swollen belly and dull face. He has been fed rice water (rice milk) in his diet mostly. On investigations, the child is found to have low    serum protein and low albumin. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)kwashiorkor
b)Marasmus
c)Indian childhood cirrhosis
d)kawasaki disease","The given clinical scenario of a child with a swollen belly, dull face with hypoproteinemia along with poor diet history suggests the diagnosis of kwashiorkor.



kwashiorkor is a form of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) characterized by edema and apathy. In edematous malnutrition, the initial appearance of edema is commonly observed in the feet and
lower legs, progressing into generalized edema affecting the hands, arms, and face. The skin over   the swollen areas may show dark, crackled, peeling patches (flaky paint dermatosis) with pale skin underneath, making it susceptible to infections.
There may be sparse and easily pluckable hair. Hepatomegaly with fatty infiltration is a common finding. Associated symptoms of misery, apathy, and loss of appetite are seen in children with
edema.
other options:
option B: Marasmus is a severe form of wasting characterized by significant loss of fat and muscle tissue as the body utilizes these resources for energy. It is often triggered by acute starvation or
illness in individuals with borderline nutritional status.
option C: Indian childhood cirrhosis (ICC) is a chronic liver disease that affects infants and young children. Common symptoms include jaundice, pruritus, lethargy, and hepatosplenomegaly. The    disease progresses rapidly, leading to the development of cirrhosis.
option D: kawasaki disease (kD) is a systemic inflammatory disorder with arteritis of medium to large-sized vessels. It presents with fever, rash, conjunctivitis,  and cervical lymph node
enlargement.",,A,
Q3,"A 3-year-old male has the following buccal mucosa finding. After three days, he presents to your OPD with a rash. what is your diagnosis?","a)Measles
b)Leukoplakia
c)scarlet fever
d)kawasaki disease","The given image shows small red lesions with bluish-white spots in the center on the inner aspects of the cheek opposite to the lower premolar, indicating the presence of koplik spots. The
appearance of these spots, along with a rash appearing three days later, strongly suggests a diagnosis of measles.
The measles virus is a single-stranded RNA virus. Measles infection has 4 phases: the incubation period, prodromal illness, exanthematous phase (characterized by the rash), and recovery phase.
After an incubation period of 8-12 days, the prodromal phase of measles starts with mild fever and is followed by conjunctivitis, photophobia, coryza, cough, and increasing fever. koplik spots,
appearing 1-4 days prior to the rash, are a characteristic sign of measles.
Symptoms gradually intensify over a period of 2-4 days until the first day of the rash. The rash
typically begins on the forehead (around the hairline), behind the ears, and on the upper neck as a red maculopapular eruption. It then spreads downward to the torso and extremities, often
becoming confluent on the face and upper trunk.
Complications include acute otitis media (most common), pneumonia (the most common cause of death), croup, bronchiolitis, reactivation of tuberculosis, diarrhea, appendicitis, febrile seizures,     and encephalitis. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a rare chronic complication of measles.
other options:
option B: Leukoplakia appears as a white patch in the oral cavity that cannot be wiped off.
option C: Scarlet fever is Group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis and is characterized by a
distinctive sandpaper rash. The rash appears as a diffuse, finely papular, erythematous eruption



that turns the skin bright red and blanches on pressure. It starts around the neck and spreads to the trunk and extremities.
option D: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic inflammatory disorder with arteritis of medium to   large-sized vessels. It presents with fever, rash (maculopapular, erythema multiforme urticarial, or micropustular), conjunctivitis, and cervical lymph node enlargement.",5603-3570.PNG,A,
Q4,The given chest X-ray is suggestive of:,"a)Tetralogy of Fallot
b)Atrial septal defect
c)ventricular septal defect
d)Ebstein's anomaly","The given chest X-ray shows a boot-shaped cardiac silhouette which is suggestive of the Tetralogy of Fallot.
The boot-shaped (coeur en sabot) cardiac silhouette is seen due to the right ventricular
hypertrophy and upward shift of the cardiac apex. The hilar areas and lung fields appear relatively clear due to reduced pulmonary blood flow or the small size of the pulmonary arteries, or both.
In Ebsteins's anomaly (option D) box-shaped heart is seen.",5600-3569.PNG,A,
Q5,The greenish-black color of the first stool in the newborn is due to :,"a)Bilirubin
b)Biliverdin
c)Meconium
d)Gut flora of neonate","The greenish-black color of the first stool in the newborn is due to biliverdin.
Meconium is a dark, viscous material that is normally present in the intestine of the fetus and passed within 1st 48hour of life. Meconium appears after the 2oth week and at term, it is
uniformly distributed throughout the gut up to the rectum indicating the presence of intestinal peristalsis.
It is composed of various products of secretion, such as desquamated fetal cells,
glycerophospholipids from the lungs, lanugo, scalp hair, vernix, and undigested products from swallowed amniotic fluid. The greenish-black color of meconium is due to the presence of bile  pigments excreted by the biliary tract, especially biliverdin (pigment from the oxidation of
bilirubin).
During intrauterine hypoxia, the relaxation of the anal sphincter due to vagal stimulation can lead to the passage of meconium into the amniotic fluid. Additionally, the release of arginine
vasopressin (AVP) from the fetal pituitary gland due to intrauterine hypoxia can stimulate the
colon muscles to contract, resulting in intraamniotic defecation. Meconium aspiration syndrome can occur when meconium is inhaled, as it is toxic to the lungs.
other options:
option A: Bilirubin is responsible for the yellow color of the stools.
option D: Neonates do not harbor gut flora at birth.",,B,
Q6,Maternal antibodies that do not provide significant immunity in a neonate:,"a)Tetanus
b)polio
c)Diptheria
d)Measles","Maternal antibodies do not provide significant immunity to polio infection in a neonate.



Administering an oral polio vaccine (oPv) dose at birth can provide early mucosal protection, safeguarding against enteric pathogens before they can hinder the intestinal mucosal immune response. Furthermore, administering oPv during the period when infants are protected by    maternal antibodies may help prevent vaccine-associated paralytic polio (vAPP).
All pregnant women should receive a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular
pertussis (Tdap) vaccine during each pregnancy, as early in the 27–36-week-of-gestation window as possible. The maternal antibodies formed from Tdap will provide immunity against tetanus,   diphtheria, and pertussis in the newborn. Administering the Tdap vaccine earlier, between the     27th and 36th week of gestation, maximizes the transfer of passive antibodies to the infant
(options A and c).
Infants less than 6 months are generally protected from measles by maternal antibodies (option
D).",,B,
Q7,"Anuj has been■ diagnosed with diphtheria and is being treated in the ward. His 3-year-old
brother, Ajay who lives in the same house has received vaccination against diphtheria about   16 months back. what is the next best step for the management of the younger sibling, Ajay?","a)one booster dose
b)Nothing as the child is already exposed
c)Erythromycin + diphtheria toxoid
d)Erythromycin only","In the given clinical scenario, a 3-year-old child is likely to have received the 4th dose (1st booster) of the diphtheria vaccine between 16–24 months of age according to National Immunization
schedule (i.e., 16 months ago). since he has received a booster dose within 5 years,
only erythromycin is indicated in case of close contact with the diphtheria patient.
All household contacts with diphtheria patients should be closely monitored for 7 days. culture    should be taken from both the throat and nose. All contacts should receive antibiotic prophylaxis (benzathine penicillin G or erythromycin), regardless of immunization status.
children who have not received a booster dose of the diphtheria toxoid vaccine within 5 years
should be given the vaccine in an age-appropriate form. children who have not yet received their 4th dose should be vaccinated accordingly.
If fewer than three doses of diphtheria toxoid have been given, or vaccination history is unknown, an immediate dose of diphtheria toxoid should be given and the primary series completed
according to the current schedule.
Asymptomatic carriers of diphtheria are treated with antimicrobial prophylaxis for a period of
1o-14 days. If an individual has not received a booster dose of diphtheria toxoid within 1 year, an age-appropriate preparation of the vaccine should be administered promptly.
Droplet precautions (respiratory colonization) or contact precautions (cutaneous colonization) of cases and carriers are maintained until two consecutive negative cultures (collected 24 hours
apart) are obtained after cessation of therapy.",,D,

Q9,A 3-year-old girl was brought by her mother with complaints of enlarged clitoris. karyotype revealed 46xx. what is the likely cause?,"a)21 hydroxylase deficiency
b)11 hydroxylase deficiency
c)3 beta dehydrogenase deficiency
d)2, 3 lyase deficiency","The given clinical scenario of a girl (46xx) with an enlarged clitoris is highly suggestive of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia/adrenogenital syndrome is a family of autosomal-recessive
disorders caused by the deficiency of enzymes involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones in the adrenal cortex. The majority of cases of CAH are caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This deficiency leads to a lack of synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone, resulting in the salt-wasting   form of the disease, which is the most severe form.
severe 21-hydroxylase deficiency presents with symptoms including weight loss, dehydration,
weakness, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances. Accumulated steroid precursors like
17-hydroxyprogesterone, are shunted into the pathway of androgen synthesis leading to elevated levels of androstenedione and testosterone. This can result in abnormal genital development in   affected female fetuses during early gestation.
Females may have masculinized external genitalia. This can include enlargement of the clitoris, partial or complete labial fusion, and a shared opening of the vagina and urethra (urogenital
sinus).
untreated individuals develop signs of androgen excess after birth.  These signs include
accelerated skeletal maturation, premature epiphyseal closure leading to stunted adult stature,    excessive muscular development, the appearance of pubic and axillary hair, acne, and deepening of the voice. In males, enlargement of the penis, scrotum, and prostate. In females, the clitoris     may become further enlarged.
Diagnosis of confirmed by elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels. Glucocorticoid replacement with hydrocortisone is done. In a salt-wasting crisis, fludrocortisone supplementation is given. vaginoplasty and clitoral recession are done for females with ambiguous genitalia.",,A,
Q10,A newborn is brought with evisceration of bowel loops from a defect in the abdominal wall to the right of the umbilicus. The most probable diagnosis is,"a)omphalocele
b)umbilical hernia
c)Gastroschisis
d)Ectopia vesicae","The most probable diagnosis for the evisceration of bowel loops, coming out of a defect in the    abdominal wall to the right of the umbilicus is gastroschisis. It occurs when there is a failure in the closure of the body wall in the abdominal region.
Gastroschisis is an abdominal wall defect located on one side of the umbilicus (right side
commonly) allowing protrusion of the intestines, stomach, bladder, and sometimes ovaries or



undescended testes. The loops ofthe bowel are not covered by amnion as they herniate through    the abdominal wall directly into the amniotic cavity. The affected bowel loops can be damaged by exposure to amniotic fluid.
Risk factors include teenage pregnancy, recreational drug use, smoking, and genitourinary
infection during pregnancy. After birth, careful management is required to prevent twisting or  kinking of the blood supply to the intestines. The abdomen is wrapped with transparent plastic wrap, a nasogastric tube is inserted, and fluid resuscitation is initiated.
Depending on the severity, primary closure under general anesthesia or gradual reduction using a preformed silo may be performed. parenteral nutrition is often needed for several weeks to
support intestinal recovery.


other options:
option A: In omphalocele bowel loops fail to return from the physiologic umbilical hernia. since the umbilicus is covered by a reflection of the amnion, the omphalocele is also covered by the
amnion.






option B: congenital umbilical hernia occurs due to the incomplete closure or weakness of the muscular umbilical ring. It presents as a soft swelling covered by skin that protrudes during
activities like crying, coughing, or straining, and it can be easily pushed back through the fibrous ring at the umbilicus. The hernia contains the omentum or segments of the small intestine.
The image below shows an umbilical hernia:


option D: Ectopia vesicae/bladder exstrophy is a congenital abnormality that occurs when the
lower abdominal wall does not form properly and the bladder protrudes from the abdominal wall, with its mucosa exposed.
The image below shows ectopia vesicae/bladder exstrophy",,C,5611-3572.PNG;5611-3571.PNG;5612-3573.PNG;5516-3523.PNG
