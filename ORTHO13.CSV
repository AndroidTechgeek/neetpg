Q1,"A 25-year-old male who sustained a shoulder injury presented with swelling around the
shoulder joint. An X-ray of the shoulder joint is shown below. which is/are the ligament(s) likely to have been injured?","a)Both acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligament.
b)coracohumeral ligament
c)coracoacromial ligament
d)Acromioclavicular ligament","The given image shows that the clavicle has moved up and there is a gap between the clavicle and the acromion suggesting injury to both acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligament.
The acromioclavicular joint is a synovial plane type between the acromial end of the clavicle and   the medial acromial margin. The two ligaments providing support are acromioclavicular(intrinsic ) and coracoclavicular(extrinsic). The acromioclavicular ligament has a superior part that extends between the upper aspect of the clavicle's lateral end and the adjacent acromion. Its inferior part, extends between the lower surface of the clavicle's lateral end and the adjoining acromion.
Additionally, it serves as an attachment site for the intra-articular disc.
The coracoclavicular ligament connects the clavicle with the coracoid process of the scapula.
Although it is separate from the acromioclavicular joint, it plays a crucial role in maintaining the alignment of the acromion and the clavicle. Therefore, it contributes significantly to the
suspension mechanism of the scapula. The ligament has two parts - trapezoid and conoid parts.
The primary cause of injury is direct impact to the lateral aspect of the shoulder or the acromion process while the arm is in an adducted position. It can also be caused by falling onto an
outstretched hand or elbow.
standard X-rays are sufficient for diagnosing acromioclavicular joint injuries and should be
utilized to assess other potential sources of shoulder pain resulting from trauma. By comparing  the coracoclavicular interspace distance with the contralateral view, the injury can be identified.",5441-3474.PNG,A,5447-3475.PNG
Q2,"A 14-year-old male presented with a mushroom-like tumor in the distal femur for the past 2 years. which of the following features will help the clinician to identify a malignant
transformation?","a)Initially growth of the tumor was away from the joint, now the growth of tumor is towards the joint.
b)Tumor does not have malignant transformation potential.
c)Tumor is in continuation with bone marrow cavity of the normal bone.
d)Hyaline cap thickness on MRI is 2cms.","The given X-ray shows a well-defined exostosis pointing to the diagnosis of osteochondroma.
2cms thickness of hyaline cap thickness on MRI is suggestive of malignant transformation.
osteochondroma can turn into low-grade chondrosarcoma but the malignant transformation is extremely rare(option B). It should be suspected in the following cases:
• Growth after skeletal maturity
• Lucency in the bone
• Additional scintigraphic activity
• Cortical destruction
• pain after puberty
• soft tissue mass
• Thickened cartilage cap &gt;2 cm
osteochondromas are common benign bone tumors mostly arising from the metaphysis of long bones. The cortical and medullary continuity of the tumor with the underlying bone is a
pathognomonic feature that establishes the diagnosis. (option C). The lesions consist of a bony mass, often in the form of a stalk, produced by endochondral ossification of a growing
cartilaginous cap. Most of these lesions are asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally.
These are of two types: pedunculated and sessile, pedunculated types are more common. The
definite stalk is directed away from the physis(option A). The lesions are usually covered with a cartilaginous cap which cannot be seen radiologically and hence the lesions are larger clinically  than what their X-Ray appearance suggests. The important feature is that the host bone flares    from the cortex into the osteochondroma.
Most patients are asymptomatic and never seek medical attention. However, symptomatic people may undergo resection.",5437-3473-1.png,D,
Q3,"A 16-year-old girl presents with multiple swellings and multiple brown rashes. she has
increased uptake on bone scans over the femur, skull, and ribs. Biochemical parameters are abnormal. she also has a history of hypothyroidism. An X-ray of her femur is given below.   which of the following is the likely diagnosis?","a)Langerhans cell histiocytosis
b)Mccune-Albright syndrome
c)Neuroma with bone involvement
d)papillary carcinoma of thyroid","The above X-ray shows the bending of the femur known as shepherd's crook deformity. It is seen in fibrous dysplasia of the proximal femur. The diagnosis based on the x-ray and clinical scenario points to Mccune-Albright syndrome.
Mccune Albright syndrome presents as a triad of cafe-au-lait spots (cutaneous
pigmentation), polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, and precocious puberty. It is also associated
with multiple endocrinopathies like hyperthyroidism, acromegaly, etc. The locus of involvement is the GNAs1 gene.
cutaneous pigmentation is more prominent on the side with severe bone involvement. Fibrous
dysplasia is a condition that affects bone development and is characterized by the replacement of the bone with fibrous tissue. The patient presents with a progressive limb deformity or a fracture through a previously asymptomatic lesion. The presentation often occurs in the second decade.
other symptoms include nonspecific bone pain, tenderness, and swelling in the affected area. The commonly involved sites are the proximal femur, tibia, pelvis, and foot.
Radiological findings include:
• well-defined, expansile intramedullary lesions
• Hazy ground glass appearance is seen in the majority of cases
• shepherd's crook deformity - expansion with marked varus in the proximal femur.






other options:
option A: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) occurs due to the proliferation of a special type of immature dendritic cells, called Langerhans cells. Their normal function is to present antigens.   The most common mutation is the BRAFV6OOE gain-of-function mutation.
It is characterized by single or multiple osteolytic bone lesions and can also infiltrate nearly every organ, like the skin (of the scalp), lungs, liver, spleen, bone marrow, or the central nervous
system. It presents with pain and swelling in the affected area. spinal involvement results in   compression fractures and neurological involvement. Vertebral involvement results in a rapid flattening of the vertebral body (vertebra plana).
LCH can present as the following clinical entities:
• Multifocal multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis (Letterer-siwe disease) which is mostly seen in infants
• unifocal and multifocal system Langerhans cell histiocytosis (eosinophilic granuloma) - The combination of bone defects, diabetes insipidus, and exophthalmos is called
the Hand-schüller-Christian triad that is mostly seen in younger children
• Pulmonary LCH is mostly seen in adults.
option D: Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid (PTC) presents as a painless nodule or mass in the   neck or enlargement of cervical lymph nodes. It usually occurs in women between 25 to 5O years of age. PTC is the most common thyroid cancer associated with previous exposure to ionizing
radiation. Conventional PTCs have translocations involving RET or NTRK, and point mutations involving the BRAF gene.
Patients present with painless swelling. Initial presentation may be with cervical
lymphadenopathy due to lymph node metastases.",5437-3473.PNG,B,5437-3473.PNG;5416-3453.PNG
Q4,"A patient came to the emergency department with a history of road traffic accident and a
shaft of femur fracture. The patient was stabilized. After 12 hours, he developed sudden onset breathlessness, confusion, and petechial skin rashes over the chest and axilla. what is the
probable diagnosis?","a)Fat embolism
b)Head injury
c)Blunt trauma to the chest
d)Hemorrhagic shock","The most likely diagnosis based on the given clinical scenario is fat embolism.
Fat embolism is caused by the fat globules originating from the bone marrow following the
fracture of long bones. clinical features of fat embolism are usually seen within 72 hours. They    include tachycardia, fever, breathlessness, petechiae, confusion, and restlessness. Gurd's criteria is used for the diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome:
There is no specific test for diagnosis. However, urine analysis to look for fat globules and    monitoring of blood po2 are done. Management offat embolism is mostly supportive, with oxygen therapy.
other options:
option c: A majority of chest trauma is caused by blunt injuries. six life-threatening conditions such as airway obstruction, tension pneumothorax, open pneumothorax, massive hemothorax,
flail chest, and pericardial tamponade should be immediately investigated and treated. only 1o% or less of blunt chest trauma patients require surgical treatment, and the remaining patients can  be treated conservatively.
option D: Hemorrhagic shock is the most common cause of shock in surgical or trauma patients. Here the patient presents with agitation, cold clammy extremities, hypotension, tachycardia, and weak peripheral pulses. Acidosis and elevated lactate levels may be seen due to hypoperfusion of  tissues.",,A,
Q5,choose the true statements:,"a)ii, iii and iv only
b)i, iii only
c)iii, iv only
d)i, ii only","statements ii, iii, and iv are true, and statement i is incorrect.
statement i: The most commonly fractured carpal bone is the lunate is a false statement. The most common fractured bone is the scaphoid.
statement ii: The scaphoid is most commonly fractured at the waist is a true statement. A
scaphoid fracture is more common in young adults. commonly, the fracture occurs through the waist of the scaphoid.
statement iii: The cast for scaphoid fracture is set in a glass holding position is a true
statement. The affected hand is immobilized in a scaphoid cast for 3-4 months. The scaphoid cast extends from below the elbow to the metacarpal heads including the thumb up to the
inter-phalangeal joint. The wrist is maintained in a little dorsiflexion and radial deviation (glass holding position).
statement iv: kienböck's disease is due to osteonecrosis of the lunate is a true
statement. kienböck's disease is usually seen in young adults, who present with pain and stiffness in the wrist. A history of trauma may be present. on examination, localized tenderness can be
appreciated over the lunate, and a reduction in grip strength can be
noted. Limited and painful wrist movements are noted in the later stages of the disease.",,A,
Q6,what type of gait will be seen following a fracture in this region?,"a)waddling
b)High stepping
c)wide-stepping gait
d)stamping","In the above scenario, the structure marked in the given image is the neck of the fibula. Injury at this site causes failure of dorsiflexion (foot drop) due to injury to the common fibular nerve (also known as common peroneal nerve). Foot drop leads to high stepping gait.
The common peroneal nerve supplies the extensors and evertors ofthe foot. Injury to the
common peroneal nerve results in foot drop. so the patient attempts to lift the leg high enough   during walking so that the foot does not drag on the floor. This is known as a high-stepping gait.
The common fibular is derived from the dorsal branches ofthe L4 - L5 and s1 - s2 ventral rami. It innervates the short head of the biceps femoris in the posterior compartment of the thigh and
then continues into the lateral and anterior compartments of the leg and onto the foot.
It gives the following branches:
• sural communicating nerve (cutaneous branch)
• Lateral sural cutaneous nerve (cutaneous branch)
• superficial fibular nerve
• Deep fibular nerve.
Injury to the common peroneal nerve will lead to:
• weakness of dorsiflexion of foot or foot drop
• Loss of dorsiflexion
• Loss of sensation over the lateral aspect of the leg and dorsum of the foot.
• wasting of fibular and anterior tibial muscles.
other options:
option A: waddling gait is seen in developmental dysplasia of the hip and in proximal muscle weakness.
option C: wide-stepping gait is a broad-based unstable gait and is indicative of cerebellar dysfunction.
option D: stamping of the foot is seen in tarsal tunnel syndrome. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is a condition with pain and sensory disturbance occurring in the medial part of the forefoot,
unrelated to weight-bearing. This is due to compression of the posterior tibial nerve behind and below the medial malleolus. Typically the pain worsens at night and gets relieved on walking or stamping the foot.",5441-3474-1.png,B,
Q7,True statements about bankart lesion?,"a)Avulsion of the anteroinferior glenoid labrum   b) Avulsion of the anterosuperior glenoid labrum
b)Depression in posteroinferior part of the head of the humerus
c)Depression in posterosuperior part of the head of the humerus","Bankart lesion is an avulsion in the anteroinferior part of the glenoid labrum caused due to the recurrent anterior dislocation of the humeral head.
Hill-sachs lesion is a compression fracture on the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head. It is caused by the pressure of the anterior glenoid rim on the humeral head in recurrent
dislocations.
Anterior dislocation is the commonest shoulder dislocation and can be caused due to trauma from behind the shoulder pushing the head out anteriorly. It is also caused due to falling on an



outstretched hand in an abducted and externally rotated shoulder. It can be diagnosed on clinical examination with flattening of the shoulder contour and ability to place a rule (Hamilton ruler
test) and the inability to touch his/her opposite shoulder (Duga's test). X-ray confirms the diagnosis and may show associated Hill sachs or bony bankart lesion. The most
common complication is recurrent shoulder dislocation.
The following X-ray shows the Bankart lesion and Hill-sachs lesion:",,A,5452-3476.PNG
Q8,Hawkin's classification is used for which fractures?,"a)Talus
b)Navicular
c)Tibia
d)calcaneum","Hawkin's classification is used for the fracture of the neck of the talus.
The fracture of the neck of the talus most commonly occur following a high-energy injury causing forced dorsiflexion with axial load. They can be further classified using Hawkin's classification:
• Type I - undisplaced
• Type II - subtalar dislocation
• Type III - subtalar and tibiotalar dislocation
• Type IV - subtalar, tibiotalar, and talonavicular dislocation
undisplaced fractures are managed conservatively in a short leg cast for 8-12 weeks and a
non-weight bearing cast for 6 weeks. Hawkin's type II-IV are managed by open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF).
The below image shows the Hawkins classification of talar neck fractures.",,A,5453-3477.PNG
Q9,"A female patient presented with swollen and tender joints. There is symmetric involvement of multiple joints such as wrists, hands, and feet, which is bilateral, along with morning stiffness lasting more than 1 hour. Erythema is absent. what is the most probable diagnosis?","a)Gout
b)Rheumatoid arthritis
c)osteoarthritis
d)psoriatic arthritis","In the above clinical scenario, a female patient presenting with swollen and tender joints,
symmetric involvement of multiple joints such as wrists, hands, and feet, bilateral in nature, along with morning stiffness lasting for more than 1 hour, and the absence of erythema is rheumatoid
arthritis.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of symmetric polyarthritis, mainly
affecting the small joints of the hands and feet. Its incidence increases between 25 and 55 years of age. clinically, patients present with early morning joint pain and stiffness lasting &gt;1 hour that  relieves with activity.
signs and symptoms -
• swelling and pain of the small joints of the hands initially- metacarpophalangeal (McP)
and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are commonly involved. Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint involvement is usually due to coexistent osteoarthritis.
• Morning stiffness
• swan-neck deformity - Hyperextension of the PIP joint with flexion of the DIP joint
• Boutonnière deformity - Flexion of the PIP joint with hyperextension of the DIP joint, • Z-line deformity - subluxation of the first McP joint with hyperextension of the first    interphalangeal (IP) joint
• ulnar deviation of fingers
• constitutional findings such as fever, weight loss, etc
• Monoarthritis of large joints can occur later
• Tenosynovitis of palm(trigger finger)
• Atlantoaxial joint involvement



Joints commonly affected in Rheumatoid Arthritis: (bilateral and symmetrically involved)
• McP joints
• wrists
• PIP joints
• MTP joints
• Atlantoaxial joint
Laboratory investigations - Detection of Rheumatoid factor and anti-ccP antibodies help in differentiating this condition from other forms of arthritis.
Diagnosis is made with clinical signs and symptoms with corroboration from lab and imaging findings.
other options-
option (A): Gout is characterized by episodic acute arthritis or chronic arthritis due to the
deposition of monosodium urate(MSU) crystals in the joints and connective tissue. It commonly affects postmenopausal women and middle-aged to elderly men. The metatarsophalangeal
joint (MTP) of the first toe is commonly involved. other joints that are commonly affected include the tarsal joints, ankle, and knee.
option (c): osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis with a high prevalence in
the elderly population. commonly involved joints are the knee, hip, first MTP, and the cervical and lumbosacral spine. In the hands, the DIP and PIP joints and the base ofthe thumb are
commonly involved. The wrist, elbow, and ankle are usually spared.
option (D): Psoriatic arthritis- In most cases psoriasis precedes arthritis but in some cases, both of them present in a span of 1 year, or arthritis precedes psoriasis. There can be involvement
of DIP and PIP joints and the joint involvement tends to follow ""ray ""distribution. Ray distribution refers to the involvement of all the joints of one finger while the adjacent finger is totally
spared. Nail changes in the affected fingers are a differentiating feature of this condition.",,B,
Q10,"A 45-year-old patient with a tibial fracture in a cast presented to the emergency department     with complaints of intense pain. The cast was removed and on examination, passive extension was painful. The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were present and there was a loss    of sensation over the first web space. what is the next step?","a)Duplex imaging
b)Re-apply cast
c)Measure anterior compartment pressure
d)Analgesics","The clinical presentation of this patient with a history of tibial fracture complaining of intense
pain, with painful passive extension and loss of sensation of the first web space upon the removal of the cast, is suggestive of acute compartment syndrome. The next step would be to measure the anterior compartment pressure to confirm the diagnosis.
Acute compartment syndrome refers to the rise in intra-compartmental pressure leading to tissue ischemia and necrosis. The injuries at high risk of developing acute compartment syndrome are    fractures of the proximal one-third of the tibia, soft tissue injury, distal radius fracture, and
diaphyseal fracture of the forearm. other high-risk injuries are crush injuries and circumferential burns.
The classic features of ischemia in acute compartment syndrome include the 5 Ps:
• Pain: is the first symptom of acute compartment syndrome. on passive stretching of the muscles, severe pain can be elicited.



• paresthesia: paresthesia and hypoesthesia are the first signs of nerve ischemia.
• paralysis: paralysis of muscle groups affected in that compartment is a late sign.
• pulselessness: usually, the peripheral pulses and capillary return are intact in the early stages, unless there is a major arterial injury. If pulses are absent, arteriography is indicated.
• pallor: may not always be seen as ischemia occurs at the capillary level.
The diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring the intra-compartmental pressure using a split catheter introduced into the compartment. The difference between diastolic pressure and
compartment pressure is known as differential pressure (Δp). If the differential pressure (Δp) is less than 3o mm Hg, immediate compartment decompression is indicated.
Treatment:
• prompt decompression of the affected compartment is done.
• All the dressings, bandages, and cast on the affected limb are removed and the limb is nursed flat.
• Fasciotomy is done if the differential pressure is less than 3o mm Hg
• Fasciotomy wounds are left open and observed after 2 days. If there is necrosis, debridement is    done. If the wounds are healthy, they can be sutured without tension or skin grafting can be done.",,C,
Q11,Three-point bony relationship of the elbow will not be damaged in?,"a)supracondlyar fracture humerus
b)Intercondylar fracture humerus
c)Elbow dislocation
d)Lateral epicondyle fracture","The three-point bony relationship will not be damaged in supracondylar fracture.
supracondylar fracture of the humerus is most commonly seen in children of 5-7 years after a fall on an outstretched hand with the elbow in full extension. It is most commonly of extension
type followed by flexion type. Gartland classification is used for supracondylar fractures. The   three-point bony relationship is maintained in supracondylar fracture (option B). Three-point  bony landmarks in the elbow are the tips of medial and lateral epicondyles and the olecranon.
Nerve and vessel injury:
• Most common nerve to be injured in extension type - anterior interosseous nerve &gt; Median nerve &gt; Radial nerve &gt; ulnar nerve. (AMRu)
• Most common nerve to be injured in flexion type - ulnar nerve.
• Most common vessel to be injured - brachial artery.
Radiological findings:
• An undisplaced fracture may show a triangular lucency like a sail of a yacht (sail sign), also   called a fat pad sign. This is due to the fat pad around the elbow being pushed forward by the hematoma.
• Baumann’s angle (humeral-capitellar angle) can help in assessing the degree of medial angulation before and after reduction.
The most common complication of supracondylar fracture is malunion. This leads to cubitus
varus or gunstock deformity. Malunion occurs due to improper reduction and not due to physeal damage, as the fracture is extraphyseal (option D). other complications include myositis



ossificans, compartment syndrome, and volkmann ischemic contracture.
undisplaced supracondylar humerus fractures are treated by an above-elbow plaster slab with the elbow in 9oo flexion. Displaced fractures are treated by closed reduction and K-wire fixation since  they tend to slip after reduction. open fractures or those associated with brachial artery injury are treated by open reduction and internal fixation.
cubitus varus deformity is corrected after skeletal maturation and lateral closed-wedge osteotomy (French osteotomy) is the method employed.",,A,
