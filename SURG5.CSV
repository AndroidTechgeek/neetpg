Q1,which of the following are indications for surgical intervention in abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"a)size more than 5.5 cm in males
b)size more than 5 cm in females
c)Expansion of &gt;o.5 cm within 6 months
d)All the above","All the given are indications for surgical intervention in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The indications include:
• size &gt;5.5 cm in males (option A)
• size &gt;4.5-5 cm in females (option B)
• Expansion of &gt;o.5 cm within 6 months or &gt;1 cm in one year (option C)
• painful, tender aneurysm
• Thrombosed aneurysm, aneurysm with distal emboli
The rupture risk is high for aneurysms &gt;5.5 cm and begins to rise exponentially with an
increase in size. women are at higher risk for rupture than men, with a lower threshold of 4.5 to 5.o cm (depending on the reference used).
screening is done for:
• Cardiovascular patients in men and women (6o-85 years)
• Men and women &gt;5o years with positive family history
• Annual screening in asymptomatic patients with 4-4.5 cm size, size &gt;4.5 cm once in every 6 months.
Management of AAA can be done by open repair or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). About  75% of infrarenal aneurysms are suitable for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), depending on the morphology of the aneurysm assessed by a CT scan.
Aneurysms that fall below the mentioned indications may safely be followed with CT or
ultrasound at 6-month intervals since long-term outcomes to routine follow-up are equivalent to earlier surgical repair of the aneurysm. smoking cessation is very important and reduces the
mortality rate.

Q2,The following image shows the retrograde ureteropyelogram of a patient with loin pain. what is the most probable clinical diagnosis?,"a)Hydronephrosis
b)Duplex kidney
c)Renal carcinoma
d)Renal stone","The given image showing dilated clubbed calyces with stricture of the left ureteropelvic junction points to a diagnosis of hydronephrosis.
Hydronephrosis refers to the dilatation of the pelvicalyceal system caused by a partial or complete blockage of urinary flow.
Investigations:
• Ultrasound is the least invasive technique for diagnosing hydronephrosis.
• Retrograde pyelography is rarely indicated but will confirm the site of obstruction before corrective surgery.
• Intravenous urogram (IVU) is helpful only if the obstructed kidney is functional. In IVU, the
extrarenal pelvis is dilated and the minor calyces lose their normal cupping. In early stages, there is blunting of calyces followed by its clubbing in the late stages.
• A renal isotope scan (DTPA or MAG-3) is the best modality to confirm the obstructive dilatation of the collecting system.",4779-2982.PNG,A,
Q3,which of the following types of renal stones are produced by laxative abuse?,"a)uric acid
b)Ammonium urate
c)struvite
d)calcium oxalate","Ammonium urate stones are most likely to be seen in patients with laxative abuse.
Loss of potassium and sodium in laxative abuse causes intracellular acidosis, which increases the production of ammonia in urine. Dehydration and sodium loss further exacerbate hypokalemia    and reduces the urinary volume, resulting in hyperuricemia. Highly concentrated uric acid and     ammonia promote the formation of ammonium urate stones.



These are also associated with inflammatory bowel disease, chronic diarrhea, ileostomy, recurrent urinary tract infection and recurrent uric acid stone formation.
The below image shows an ammonium urate stone.",,B,4790-2988.PNG
Q4,"A patient is confused, opens his eyes on painful stimuli, flexes one limb on painful stimuli, and can localize the stimulus with the other limb. His Glasgow coma score is ________","a)8
b)9
c)1o
d)11","The GCS in this patient is 11.
• The score for verbal response: 4, because he is confused.
• The score for eye-opening: 2, because his eyes are opening to only painful stimuli.
• The score for best motor response: 5, because he can localize pain.
Therefore, the GCS score is (4+2+5) = 11.",,D,
Q5,A patient presents with a painless swelling of the neck. The histology of the tissue is as given in the image below. what is the diagnosis?,"a)Medullary carcinoma
b)Non Hodgkin's lymphoma
c)Grave's disease
d)Hashimoto's thyroiditis","The slide shows the histopathology of Hashimoto thyroiditis, with:
• Follicular destruction
• Reduced colloid with increased interstitial connective tissue
• Small lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration
• A well-developed germinal centre may be seen
• Hurthle (Askanazy) cells that have abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm lining the follicles





Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. It is also known as struma lymphomatosa or lymphocytic thyroiditis. It is an autoimmune disease
that results in the destruction of the thyroid gland and gradual &amp; progressive thyroid failure.
clinical features:
• Most prevalent between 45-65 years of age
• More common in females
• Painless enlargement of the thyroid
• Hashitoxicosis: when the auto-antibodies attack and damage the follicles, there is a sudden
release of thyroid hormones from these follicles. This leads to a transient phase of thyrotoxicosis.
• Hypothyroidism: since the follicles are damaged and cannot form the hormones anymore, these patients tend to be in a state of hypothyroidism.
Diagnosis:
• T3 and T4 are low
• TsH is raised
• Autoantibodies against:
• Thyroid receptors
• Thyroid peroxidase (TPO)
• Thyroglobulin
These patients are managed with thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
In patients with long-standing goiter, there is a risk of compressive features and the development of thyroid lymphoma. such cases can be treated with total thyroidectomy. It may also predispose  to papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Other options:



option A: Histological features of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid include polygonal to
spindle-shaped cells in the form of nests, trabeculae or follicles. Small, round anaplastic cells may be found in some cases and amyloid deposits derived from calcitonin polypeptides are present in   the stroma.
The given slide below shows medullary carcinoma of thyroid:


option C: Grave's disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by hyperthyroidism due to
circulating autoantibodies. The thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins bind to the TSH receptors,  causing overgrowth of the thyroid gland and increased thyroid hormone synthesis. Histologically, there is acinar cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia with the absence of normal colloid in the tall
columnar epithelium (normally the epithelium is flat with colloid). Lymphoid infiltrates,
consisting predominantly of T cells, along with scattered B cells and mature plasma cells, are present throughout the interstitium. Germinal centers are common.

Q6,A 45-year-old male patient who presented with a scrotal swelling underwent an orchidectomy. The image below shows the histopathology findings. what is your diagnosis?,"a)seminoma
b)yolk-sac tumor
c)Embryonal cell carcinoma
d)Teratoma","Based on the gross and microscopic appearance of the specimen, the diagnosis is seminoma.
The gross specimen shows a well-circumscribed, pale, gray-white, fleshy, homogenous mass, with a lobulated cut surface, usually devoid of hemorrhage or necrosis. Histopathology shows uniform  tumor cells with abundant clear cytoplasm, distinct cell borders, and large central nuclei. There is a sparse lymphocytic infiltrate. Classically, they have a fried egg appearance.
other options:
option B: yolk-sac tumor has a yellowish-white, mucinous appearance. Histologically, they are typically composed of a lace-like (reticular) network of medium-sized cuboidal, flattened, or
spindled cells, which generally show less cytologic atypia than embryonal carcinoma. In
approximately 5o% of tumors, structures resembling endodermal sinuses (schiller-Duval bodies) may be seen; these consist of a mesodermal core with a central capillary and a visceral and
parietal layer of cells resembling primitive glomeruli.


option C: Embryonal cell carcinoma appears variegated with foci of hemorrhage or necrosis.
Histologically, the cells grow in alveolar or tubular patterns, sometimes with papillary folds. More undifferentiated lesions may display sheets of cells with cleft-like spaces. The neoplastic cells have an epithelial appearance, are large and anaplastic, and have hyperchromatic nuclei with
prominent nucleoli. The cell borders are usually indistinct, and there is considerable variation in cell and nuclear size and shape (pleomorphism). Mitotic figures and tumor giant cells are
frequently seen.





option D: Teratomas also have a variegated appearance but have cysts reflecting the multiplicity  of tissue types. Histologically, collections of differentiated cells or organoid structures originating in all 3 germ layers can be seen. Elements may be mature (resembling various adult tissues) or      immature (sharing histologic features with fetal or embryonic tissue).",4781-2984.PNG,A,4793-2992.PNG;4794-2994.PNG;4794-2993.PNG
Q7,A surgeon sees a necrotic bowel when operating on a child for an inguinal hernia. what is true about the resection and anastomosis ofthe bowel?,"a)The surgeon must use chromic catgut
b)The surgeon must not include the submucosa in the sutures
c)The surgeon must use the single-layer, extramucosal suture technique
d)The surgeon must use the single-layer seromuscular suture technique","The standard technique used currently for resection anastomosis of the bowel is a one-layer extra mucosal suture technique since it causes the least tissue necrosis and luminal narrowing.
Interrupted and continuous single-layer suture techniques are adequate and safe.
The extra mucosal suture must also include the submucosa because this layer has a high collagen content and it is the most stable suture layer in all sections of the gastrointestinal tract.

Q8,A lady comes with a reddish firm nodule on her chest which hasn't grown in size. Its histolopathological image is shown below. what is the diagnosis?,"a)Lipoma
b)Fibroadenoma
c)Nevus
d)Hemangioma","The given clinical scenario of a woman with reddish firm nodule on her chest and histology
showing multiple dilated vascular structures with a single layer of epithelial cells is suggestive of a hemangioma.
Hemangioma is a benign tumor caused by the abnormal growth of blood vessels. Types of   hemangioma are capillary hemangioma (most common), juvenile/ strawberry hemangioma, cavernous hemangioma and pyogenic hemangioma.
Indications for immediate treatment are complications such as ulceration or those pertaining to the location of the mass (e.g. visual issues due to a large hemangioma over the eyelid).
Treatment options include:
• Beta-blockers - oral propranolol
• steroids - intralesional triamcinolone, topical clobetasol, systemic steroids
• Interferon alfa-2a and vincristine - for steroid-resistant lesions
• Local resection with cutting cautery or carbon dioxide laser

Q9,which is the most common organism causing acute bacterial prostatitis?,"a)Enterococcus
b)Proteus
c)streptococcus Agalacticia
d)E.coli","The most common organism causing acute bacterial prostatitis (ABp) is Escherichia coli.
It is commonly caused by an ascending urethral infection or reflux of infected urine into prostatic ducts. sexually transmissible infections and other urinary pathogens, such as staphylococcus
aureus and streptococcus faecalis may also be responsible.
The patient presents with fever, perineal pain, chills and rigor, and dysuria. per rectal
examination will reveal a tender, boggy prostate. care should be taken to avoid aggressive palpation or prostatic massage as it can lead to bacterial dissemination and sepsis.
urine examination and culture should be done. urine examination reveals threads in urine.
Management:
patients with systemic signs of infection should be admitted for IV antibiotics, hydration, and monitoring of laboratory parameters.
patients who have no signs of systemic infection, who can tolerate oral intake, and who have no
urinary retention can be treated with oral antibiotics. Antibiotics are given for 2-6 weeks to ensure the eradication of the infection as antibiotics don't penetrate the prostate capsule easily.
For outpatient therapy: ciprofloxacin 5oo mg oral every 12 hours or levofloxacin 5oo mg OD or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole double-strength tablet oral every 12 hours can be used.
For hospitalized patients: Intravenous ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin with or without an
aminoglycoside (gentamicin or tobramycin) or intravenous beta-lactam with or without an
aminoglycoside. Gram-positive infections are treated with cephalosporins (cephalexin, cefazolin) or dicloxacillin and vancomycin.",,D,
Q10,"A 35-year-old man came with complaints of dark-colored stools to the OPD. After undergoing endoscopy, the patient was diagnosed with an upper GI bleed. which of the following
structures is used as a demarcation point to differentiate it from a lower GI bleed?","a)Ampulla ofvater
b)Ligament of Treitz
c)superior duodenal flexure
d)Ileocaecal junction","The ligament of Treitz is used as the demarcation point to differentiate between upper
gastrointestinal bleeding and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. It is a part of the duodenojejunal junction.
upper GI bleeding refers to bleeding proximal to the ligament of Treitz, and lower GI bleeding refers to bleeding distal to the ligament of Treitz.",,B,4797-2997.PNG
Q11,which is the best graft for a femoropopliteal bypass?,"a)Dacron
b)Great saphenous vein
c)polytetrafluoroethylene
d)short saphenous vein","The great saphenous vein (GSV) is the best as it lasts longer than polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), dacron, and human umbilical vein as a graft in a femoropopliteal bypass.
The GSV is the conduit of choice for arterial bypass grafts below the inguinal ligament.
For bypass above the inguinal ligament, while both GSV and PTFE grafts have similar patency rates in the first 2 years, the GSV is superior thereafter and hence preferred over PTFE or any  other grafts.
The ipsilateral GSV is the conduit of choice for femoropopliteal bypass. when it is not available, contralateral GSV should be used. other veins are preferred when both ipsilateral and
contralateral GSV is not available and they include a small saphenous vein, cephalic vein, and basilic vein.
Non-autogenous grafts are used for patients who lack a suitable venous conduit. The most
commonly used prosthetic conduit is PTFE. Recent studies have shown that heparin-bonded PTFE is superior to compared to PTFE without heparin.",,B,
Q12,what is the most common cause of chronic pancreatitis?,"a)Gallstones
b)Alcohol
c)Autoimmune
d)Drugs","Alcohol consumption is the most common cause of chronic pancreatitis, accounting for 6o–7o% of the cases. Smoking increases the risk of alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis.

Q13,"A probe is inserted into the duct from which the nipple discharge is emerging. A tennis
racquet incision is made and the flap is dissected to reach the duct. The duct is then excised. This procedure is known as?","a)Macrodochectomy
b)Microdochectomy
c)cone excision
d)wide excision of the lactiferous duct.","Microdochectomy is the excision of the entire lactiferous duct (single duct disease). It is done for duct papilloma.
Microdochectomy:
• In a duct papilloma where no palpable mass is present, the duct is expressed to observe the discharge.
• A fine probe or stiff nylon suture is gently inserted into the duct, and the probe is secured to the nipple skin using silk sutures to prevent displacement during the procedure.
• A tennis racquet shaped incision is made to elevate the skin flaps, and the duct with the probe is excised along with the skin flap for 5 cm until the papilloma is identified (The papilloma will
always be located within 5 cm from the duct orifice).
• The wound is closed without a drain, and a compression bandage is applied.
It is ideal to rule out DcIS by frozen section biopsy.
cone excision and wide excision are done under major duct excision (Adair-Haldfield operation). It is done for duct ectasias with multiple duct involvement and multiple papillomas.",,B,
Q14,which of the following is true about chromic catgut?,"a)It is made from cat gut
b)It is made from rabbit gut
c)It is absorbed by enzymatic degradation and macrophage phagocytosis
d)It is tanned with nickel salts to improve handling and to resist degradation in tissue","chromic catgut is absorbed through macrophage phagocytosis and enzymatic degradation within 9o days.
It is made from collagen derived from healthy sheep or cattle. It is then tanned with chromium salts to improve handling and resist degradation in tissue.



The tensile strength lasts for 21-28 days. It has a moderate tissue reaction as compared to plain catgut, which has a high tissue reactivity.
It is used to ligate superficial vessels, suture subcutaneous tissues, and is used for stomas and other tissues that heal rapidly. It is not used in tissues that heal slowly and require prolonged support.",,C,
Q15,Identify the instrument given in the image below:,"a)Deaver's retractor
b)Morris retractor
c)czerney's retractor
d)Double hook retractor","The given image shows a Morris retractor with a single, flat transversely curved blade and a blunt projecting ridge with backward projection.
Morris retractor can be single or double-bladed. It is used to retract abdominal wall incisions, loin incisions, subcostal wounds or any wounds in depth.
It can be used to improve visibility on one side of an incision. Thus, it is valuable during the initial phase of a laparotomy.


other options:
option A: Deaver's retractor is a question mark-shaped stout, atraumatic retractor with a broad,  gently curved long blade. It is used to retract the abdominal wall and viscera. Moist mops should be kept underneath prior to placing this retractor. It is used for major abdominal surgeries,
bladder surgeries and lumbar sympathectomy.





option C: Czerny's retractor is a superficial retractor with a thick and small blade on one side and a biflanged hook on the other side in opposite directions. It is used in hernia surgery and
laparotomy, especially during closure.

Q16,Extra mammary paget's disease is commonly seen in the:,"a)vulva
b)vagina
c)uterus
d)cervix","Extramammary paget's disease arises most frequently on the vulva. other sites include the perineum, scrotum, perianal skin, and penis.
Extramammary paget's disease (EMpD) can be primary or secondary.
• primary EMpD is more common and occurs in the absence of an underlying malignancy,
thought to arise from intraepidermal parts of apocrine glands or from pluripotent cells from the epidermis.
• secondary EMpD arises from an underlying adnexal carcinoma or internal malignancy due to the epidermotropic spread of malignant cells from the underlying tumor.
visceral malignancies associated with EMpD are carcinomas ofthe colon, rectum, bladder,
urethra, cervix, and prostate. The patient presents with well-defined, moist, erythematous scaly plaques and severe pruritis. Lichenification and excoriations may also be seen.
Diagnosis is confirmed by punch, wedge, or excisional skin biopsy. A systemic workup should also be done to identify any underlying malignancy and they include colonoscopy, cystoscopy,
colposcopy, and pelvic examination with pap smear in females.
Treatment:
• Mohs microscopic surgery with 5 cm margin clearance
• Radiotherapy
• Topical 5-fluorouracil and imiquimod
• chemotherapy

Q17,The best method to obtain tissue for the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma is:,"a)Transgastric FNAc guided by endoscopic ultrasound
b)MRI-guided biopsy
c)Laparoscopic-guided biopsy
d)percutaneous transperitoneal biopsy","Transgastric or transduodenal FNAC or trucut biopsy performed under endoscopic ultrasound
(EUS) guidance is the best method to obtain tissue for the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. This is because it avoids the spillage of tumor cells into the peritoneal cavity.
Endoscopic ultrasonography with a fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is done if CT has failed to    demonstrate a tumor. when a tissue diagnosis is required prior to surgery to distinguish between inflammation and neoplasia, EUS-FNA is helpful.
Diagnostic laparoscopy prior to resection can spare an unnecessary laparotomy by identifying small peritoneal and liver metastases.
percutaneous transperitoneal biopsy of potentially resectable pancreatic tumors is avoided.",,A,
Q18,An abdominal mass in a patient with congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is best seen .,"a)During feeding
b)soon after birth
c)During palpation over the left hypochondrium
d)During palpation over the epigastrium","In a child with congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (CHpS), the abdominal mass is best seen during test feed in the right upper quadrant.
Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis most presents with non-bilious projectile vomiting. It is
common between 2 and 8 weeks of age. Hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the pylorus results in constriction and obstruction of the gastric outlet. Male infants are at a higher risk.
Clinically, when the infant is given a test feed, an olive-shaped mass is palpable in the right upper quadrant and visible peristalsis is usually observed moving from left to right across the abdomen.
Infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis develop a characteristic metabolic
abnormality- hypochloraemic hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis. persistent vomiting results in loss of hydrochloric acid leading to the development of metabolic alkalosis (due to loss of H+)  and hypochloremia (due to loss of Cl-).



All infants with congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis are evaluated with an ultrasound (investigation of choice). It confirms the diagnosis in the majority of cases.

c)skin, subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia and Deep fascia
d)skin, subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, Deep fascia and a few muscular fibres","The incision for a fasciotomy involves the skin, subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and deep fascia.
Fasciotomy involves incising the deep muscle fascia and is best carried out via longitudinal  incisions of skin, subcutaneous fat, and superficial and deep fascia. The muscle will be seen bulging out through the fasciotomy opening.
The lower limb can be decompressed via two incisions, each being lateral to the subcutaneous
border of the tibia. This gives access to the two posterior compartments and the leg's peroneal and anterior compartments.",,C,4803-3003.PNG
Q20,which of the following statements is true about crohn's disease?,"a)For effective treatment of a crohn's mass, only antibiotics are prescribed.
b)symptomatic relapse after surgery is not related to the presence of disease during resection.
c)The proximal ileum is most commonly involved in crohn's disease.
d)on endoscopic examination, continuous lesions are visualised, which are diagnostic of crohn's disease.","symptomatic relapse of crohn's disease after surgery is not related to the presence of the disease during resection.
The course of the disease after surgery is unpredictable since surgery does not cure crohn's disease. Instead, the probability of relapse increases with the time since resection.
other options:
option A: Antibiotics alone cannot treat a crohn's mass effectively. Abscesses can be treated with metronidazole and ciprofloxacin and should also undergo drainage (and resection if needed).



option c: The terminal ileum is most commonly involved in crohn's disease.
option D: on endoscopic examination, discontinuous ""skip"" lesions are visualized. These are     irregular areas of inflamed mucosa that are ulcerated with mucopurulent exudate separated by intervening, normal-appearing intestinal mucosa.",,B,
Q21,which of the following is the earliest sign in crohn's disease?,"a)cobblestone appearance
b)Deep fissured ulcers
c)Rose-thorn appearance
d)Aphthous ulcers","Aphthous ulcers, surrounded by a rim of erythematous mucosa, are the earliest lesions seen in a patient with crohn's disease during endoscopy.
crohn's colitis usually spares the rectum and is most severe in the ileocaecal region.
• In early crohn's disease, small, punched-out aphthous ulcers are often seen (the result of submucosal lymphoid follicle expansion).
• In moderate disease, the aphthous ulcers coalesce into larger ulcers, which may take on the appearance of a star (stellate ulcers).
• As disease severity increases, submucosal edema and injury can result in cobblestoning of the   mucosa (option A) and eventually the formation of serpiginous ulcers, which are typical findings in crohn's disease.
Thorn-like extraluminal projections in barium studies are known as rose-thorn appearance, and are a typical sign of crohn's disease. They represent deep penetrating linear ulcers or fissurings  typically seen within stenosed terminal ileum with a thickened wall. (options c and D)",,D,
Q22,The van Nuys grading system for ductal carcinoma in situ does not include:,"a)Age of the patient
b)size of the tumor
c)Hormone receptor staining
d)presence of microcalcification","Staining for estrogen and progesterone receptors is not part of the van Nuys system used for grading DcIS.
The components of the van Nuys prognostic index (vNPI) are as follows:
• Size of the tumor
• Extent of resection margin
• Histological variant of DcIS - based on nuclear grade, presence of necrosis, presence of microcalcification
• Age of the patient
Patients with a high score in this grading system benefit from radiotherapy after excision, whereas those with low-grade and completely excised tumors, need no further treatment.
A score ranging from 1 (lesions with the best prognosis) to 3 (lesions with the worst prognosis) is   given for each of the four prognostic predictors. Total scores range from 4 (least likely to recur) to 12 (most likely to recur).
Note: The type of microcalcification seen on imaging, helps in determining the nuclear grade of    DcIS. while the linear branching type of microcalcification is associated with high nuclear grade, fine granular type is associated with low nuclear grade.

Q23,which of the following statements are true with regards to a keloid scar?,"a)The extent does not cross the wound margins
b)wide excision of the keloid scar prevents recurrence
c)Histopathology of a keloid scar shows reduced collagen and increased vascularity
d)A keloid scar forms due to increase in the level of growth factors","keloid scars are associated with elevated levels of growth factor leading to increased proliferation of fibrous tissue.
A keloid scar is defined as excessive scar tissue that extends beyond the boundaries of the original incision or wound (option A) and rarely regresses on its own.  It is more common in
darker-pigmented ethnicities.
It can arise from surgery, burns, skin inflammation, infections, ear piercing, and even
spontaneously. It occurs 3 months to years after the initial insult with even minor injuries causing keloid formation.
It most commonly occurs on the skin of the earlobe, deltoid, presternal, upper back, and rarely extends into the subcutaneous tissue.





The histology of keloid scars shows excess collagen and hypervascularity with collagen fibres arranged haphazardly in loose sheets (option C).
Treatment: keloid scars do not improve spontaneously with time and excision alone has a high rate of recurrence (option B). The following can be done:
• pressure - local moulds or elastic garments.
• silicone gel sheeting.
• Intralesional triamcinolone injection.
• Excision and steroid injections.
• Excision and postoperative radiation (external beam or brachytherapy).
• Intralesional excision.
• Laser to reduce redness.
• vitamin E and palm oil massage.

Q25,which of the following is not true about Barrett's esophagus?,"a)It is the intestinal metaplasia of esophagus
b)Mucus secreting foveolar cells are characteristic
c)Alician blue is used in the staining of biopsy specimen
d)It is a reversible cell adaptation","Mucus-secreting goblet cells (not foveolar cells) are characteristic of Barrett's esophagus, as there is intestinal metaplasia of the esophagus. Foveolar cells are the mucus-secreting cells in the
stomach.
Barrett's esophagus is a complication of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and it is estimated to occur in about 1o% of individuals with symptomatic GERD. symptoms include   heartburn, regurgitation and sometimes dysphagia. obese white men over the age of 6o
years represent the highest-risk group.
Intestinal metaplasia in the esophagus occurs due to chronic irritation of the esophagus in GERD (option A) since intestinal epithelium is better suited to handling gastric acid exposure. Hence,
mucus-secreting goblet cells are characteristic of Barrett's esophagus. since all metaplasia are
reversible, Barrett's esophagus is also reversible (option D). only o.2 to 1% of Barrett's esophagus leads to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma.

The shock index is a hemodynamic stability indicator. In patients with shock, it is a
better predictor of mortality than blood pressure or heart rate alone. A shock index &gt;o.9 is indicative of higher mortality.



The modified shock index is a more sensitive indicator of tissue perfusion than the original shock index. In critically ill patients, the DBP decreases earlier than SBP, hence, the modified shock
index using MAP is better suited to assess the severity of shock.",,C,
