Q1,A diabetic patient's fasting blood glucose level is found to be 16o mg/dL. what will you advise the patient regarding non-pharmacological management?,"a)At least 8o mg dietary fibre
b)&lt;5 g sodium intake everyday
c)&lt;3o% of the calories should come from fat
d)cholesterol &lt;1oo mg","The advice that can be given to the patient regarding non-pharmacological management is that &lt;3o% of the calories should come from fat.
Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) refers to the optimal coordination of caloric intake along with other aspects of diabetes therapy (insulin, exercise, and weight loss). According to the Indian     Research society for Diabetes, these are the non-pharmacological recommendations:
• carbohydrate content should be limited to 5o%-6o% of total calorie intake. complex
carbohydrates and low glycemic index foods should be preferred. Fiber intake should be around 25-4og per day.
• Protein intake should be 15% of the total calorie intake. Intake of red meat should be avoided.
• Fat intake should be limited to less than 3o% of the total calorie intake. oils with high
monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) should be used.
saturated fatty acid intake should be less than 1o% of the total calories per day. Non vegetarians should consume 1oo■2oo g of fish/week as these are rich sources of PUFA. vegetarians should



consume vegetable oils (soybean/ safflower/sunflower), walnuts, and flaxseeds.
• patients should consume a diet rich in fruits, leafy vegetables, nuts, fibers, whole grains, unsaturated fat, legumes, unprocessed vegetables, and low-fat dairy.
• salt consumption should be less than 5g per day (not sodium). sodium consumption should be less than 23oo mg per day.
• patients should be advised to avoid smoking, alcohol intake, sugars, and sweetened beverages. A minimum of 15o min/week of physical activity is recommended for healthy Indians to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. This should involve:
• ≥3o min of moderate■intensity aerobic activity each day
• 15■3o min of work■related activity
• 15 min of muscle■strengthening exercises (at least 3 times/week)",,C,
Q2,which of the following is the most characteristic feature of kallmann syndrome?,"a)Anosmia
b)syndactyly in males
c)precocious puberty in females
d)white forelock","Anosmia is the most characteristic feature of kallman's syndrome.
kallman's syndrome is a hypothalamic disorder that occurs due to defective
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).
It is mainly associated with anosmia or hyposmia or hypoplasia. Other associated features such as colour blindness, optic atrophy, deafness, cleft palate, renal abnormalities, and cryptorchidism
may be present.
The presenting features in males are delayed puberty and micropenis while females present with primary amenorrhoea and failure of secondary sexual development.
The condition is characterised by low luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FsH), testosterone and estradiol.
Treatment includes human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or testosterone in males for restoration of puberty and secondary sexual characteristics. In females, cyclic estrogen and progestin can be   given. Fertility is restored by giving gonadotropins or pulsatile GnRH",,A,
Q3,A chronic cigarette smoker now joined a construction company. His pulmonary function test results are given below. what is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?,"a)vascular disease with bronchodilator reversibility
b)Restrictive lung disease with bronchodilator reversibility
c)Restrictive lung disease without bronchodilator reversibility
d)obstructive disease with bronchodilator reversibility","In the given clinical scenario, FEV1/FVC is less than o.7, hence it is obstructive. After
bronchodilation, FEV1 has increased from o.9L to 1.9L, which is more than 12% implying its reversible. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is an obstructive disease with bronchodilator  reversibility.
In obstructive pulmonary disease, FEV1/FVC is reduced to &lt;o.7 and FEV1 is also reduced
&lt;8o%. Reversibility is defined as a ≥12% increase and absolute increase of 2oomL in the FEV1 at least 15 min after administration of a β2 -agonist. Examples of obstructive pulmonary disease   include COpD, asthma, bronchiectasis, etc.



In restrictive pulmonary disease, FEV1/FVC is normal or increased ( &gt;o.7) and FEV1 and FVC are also reduced. Examples of restrictive pulmonary disease include asbestosis, sarcoidosis,
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, etc.",,D,
Q4,which of the following is not a first-line drug for the management of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis?,"a)sulfasalazine
b)Hydroxychloroquine
c)Methotrexate
d)Azathioprine","Azathioprine is not a first-line drug used in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is a purine synthesis inhibitor and has been used for the management of RA earlier, but it is not
preferred now due to inconsistent efficacy, myelosuppression, high hepatic toxicity, and renal damage.
The drugs used for the treatment of RA can be classified into broad categories:
• NSAIDs for pain relief.
• Glucocorticoids are given before initiating DMARD (disease-modifying anti-rheumatoid drug) therapy.
• Biological agents such as TNF-α inhibitors, abatacept, anakinra, rituximab and interleukin -6 inhibitors are useful in RA.
• DMARDs
DMARDs as follows:
• Methotrexate is the first choice, supplemented with folic acid to prevent side effects.
• Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is given as an adjuvant in combination with other DMARDs.
• Sulfasalazine helps to reduce the radiographic progression of the disease.
• Leflunomide
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease, presenting with early morning joint pain and stiffness that relieves with activity, mainly involving the metacarpophalangeal (MCP)
and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. other hallmark features include flexor tendon tenosynovitis, swan neck deformity, boutonniere deformity, and Z-line deformity.
Extra Articular features like subcutaneous nodules (most common), secondary Sjogren's syndrome, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary nodules, and anemia may be present.
Patients may have elevated ESR (Erythrocyte sedimentation rate) or C reactive protein (CRP). Rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) antibodies are helpful in
differentiating RA from other polyarticular conditions and also have prognostic significance.",,D,
Q5,AIDS-defining malignancies include all except :,"a)kaposi's sarcoma
b)Melanoma
c)Invasive cervical carcinoma
d)Non hodgkins lymphoma","Melanoma is not an AIDS-defining malignancy.
AIDS-defining malignancies are those cancers that a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infected person is at a high risk of developing. when a HIV-infected person develops one of the AIDS-defining malignancies it suggests that he has AIDS.



AIDS-defining malignancies include the following:
• kaposi sarcoma - It is a multicentric neoplasm of vascular origin and has a strong association with HHV - 8.
• Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
• Invasive cervical cancer
Given below is the image of kaposi sarcoma:


Note : The FDA has approved pomalidomide, a thalidomide analogue to be included in treating adult patients with AIDS-related kaposi's sarcoma after failure of highly active antiretroviral
therapy and kaposi's sarcoma in adult patients who are HIV-negative.",,B,4377-2763.PNG
Q6,"A 4o-year-old chronic alcoholic presented with withdrawal symptoms. His liver function tests showed AST 14o IU/L, ALT 11o IU/L, and GGT 5oo IU/L. which of the following
benzodiazepines can be safely administered to this patient?","a)Diazepam
b)Alprazolam
c)clonazepam
d)Lorazepam","In the given scenario the patient has alcohol withdrawal symptoms along with deranged liver  function test findings. So the benzodiazepine that can be safely administered to this patient is lorazepam.
Lorazepam has a short half-life and it has to be considered in patients with liver impairment or  brain damage. Lorazepam, oxazepam, and Temazepam are metabolized by conjugation and are less dependent on liver function. The rest of the benzodiazepines require hepatic Cyp-mediated oxidation to metabolize and are hence not recommended for patients with elevated
transaminases.
Alcohol withdrawal syndrome is characterized by withdrawal symptoms in an alcoholic patient who suddenly stops drinking. Features include tremors of the hands, agitation, tachycardia,
tachypnoea, sweating, and insomnia. These symptoms begin after 5-1o hours of abstinence and  peak on day 2 or 3 and improve by the fourth or fifth day. If these features are associated with    delirium which includes confusion, agitation, and fluctuating consciousness, then it is known as delirium tremens.



Management is mainly by benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, and diazepam.",,D,
Q7,which of the following does not help in the localization of lesions in the spinal cord?,"a)contralateral hemiplegia
b)Fasciculation at the level of lesion
c)Upper motor neuron lesion and lower motor neuron lesion
d)Bladder involvement","contralateral hemiplegia does not help in the localization of the lesion in the spinal cord.
contralateral hemiplegia is a feature of involvement of the corticospinal tract from its origin in the cerebrum (motor homunculus) till it crosses at the level of the lower medulla. At the level of spinal cord lesion, it leads to ipsilateral hemiplegia (eg: Brown sequard syndrome)
Fasciculation at the level of lesion, upper motor neuron lesions (UMNL) and lower motor neuron lesions (LMNL), and bladder involvement are features of spinal cord lesions.
The presence of fasciculation (option B) indicates segmental signs corresponding to the disturbed  individual cord segment. other features include altered sensation, muscle atrophy, or absent deep tendon reflex.
Upper motor neuron (UMN) lesions and lower motor neuron (LMN) lesions (option c) can help     localize lesions in the spinal cord. UMN signs include paraplegia or quadriplegia with exaggerated deep tendon reflexes, positive Babinski sign, and spasticity. LMN lesions include muscle atrophy,  fasciculations, decreased reflexes, and flaccid paralysis.
Autonomic disturbances such as absent sweating below the implicated cord level and bladder involvement (option D) are seen when there is transverse damage to the spinal cord.",,A,
Q8,Mark the correct statement regarding inflammatory bowel disease.,"a)skip lesions are present in crohn's disease
b)Mucosal layers are involved in crohn's while transmural involvement seen in ulcerative colitis
c)Inflammatory bowel disease has a strong genetic predisposition
d)crohn's is curable through surgical resection of the affected segment","The correct statement regarding inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is that skip lesions are present in crohn's disease.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal
tract and is mainly idiopathic. It includes ulcerative colitis (Uc) and crohn's disease (cD). Genetic predisposition has been identified for IBD. But its association is weak for both cD and Uc (option c)
Ulcerative colitis mainly involves the mucosa of the rectum (option B) and extends proximally to the colon. Microscopically, crypt architecture is distorted. Neutrophils invade the epithelium and the crypts leading to cryptitis and crypt abscess. clinically, Uc presents with diarrhea, rectal
bleeding, tenesmus, and abdominal cramps.
crohn's disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus but
mostly involves the terminal ileum. It is characterized by transmural inflammation. The
characteristic lesions include cobblestone appearance, skip lesions, and transmural inflammation (option B). cD presents as ileocolitis characterized by right lower quadrant pain, palpable mass,  fever, and leukocytosis. Bowel obstruction can also be seen. They also present as jejunocolitis
characterized by malabsorption and steatorrhea.
Management can be:



• Medical management with sulfasalazine, glucocorticoids, and immunosuppressants like azathioprine and mercaptopurine are useful
• surgical management is indicated in ulcerative colitis. It does not cure crohn's disease (option D)",,A,
Q9,"A 4o-year-old man presents with 15 days of fever and altered sensorium for 1 day. Rapid
diagnostic test was done and plasmodium falciparum was diagnosed. which of the following is not a complication?","a)Blood glucose &lt;4o mg/dL
b)Arterial pH &gt;7.2
c)serum creatinine - 5.2
d)unarousable coma","The clinical scenario of a patient presenting with prolonged fever, altered sensorium, and test
showing Plasmodium falciparum positive is suggestive of severe falciparum malaria, Arterial pH &gt;7.2 is not a complication of falciparum malaria.
Malaria is a protozoal disease transmitted by the bite of a female anopheles mosquito that has     been infected. Five different species of Plasmodium are responsible for disease in humans. They are P. falciparum, P.vivax, P.ovale, P.malariae, and P.knowlesi.
Features of severe falciparum malaria are as follows:
• unarousable coma or cerebral malaria
• Acidosis is characterized by pH &lt;7.25, base deficit &gt;8 meq/L or plasma bicarbonate &lt;15 mmol/L, venous lactate &gt;5 mmol/L, and labored deep breathing.
• Anemia is severe with a normocytic and normochromic picture with hemoglobin &lt;5g/dL or hematocrit &lt;15%
• Renal failure is characterized by serum creatinine &gt;3 mg/dL, urine output &lt;4oo mL, and there is no improvement with rehydration.
• Pulmonary edema or adult respiratory distress syndrome
• Hypoglycemia with plasma glucose &lt;4o mg/dL
• Hypotension or shock is characterized by systolic blood pressure &lt; 5o mmHg in children and &lt; 8o mm Hg in adults, and a prolonged capillary refilling time of &gt;2s
• Bleeding or disseminated intravascular coagulation
• convulsions, weakness
• Hemoglobinuria
• Jaundice",,B,
Q10,A person presents to the hospital with fever and chills. Fever profile is ordered and is found     to be negative for malaria and dengue. rk39 test is found to be positive. what is the treatment of choice?,"a)Amphotericin B
b)Griseofulvin
c)Dapsone
d)Hydroxychloroquine","The given scenario of a person with fever with chills and a positive rk39 test is suggestive of kala-azar. The treatment of choice of this condition is amphotericin B.
kala-azar or visceral leishmaniasis is a protozoal infection mainly affecting the reticuloendothelial system. It is caused by the Leishmania donovani complex that includes L. donovani and L.
infantum. These organisms are transmitted by sandflies.
clinical features include:



• Moderate to high-grade fever with chills and rigors
• splenomegaly and hepatomegaly
• Anemia
• Lymphadenopathy
• pedal edema, ascites - due to hypoalbuminemia
• Epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleed, and retinal hemorrhages - due to thrombocytopenia
The gold standard test for the diagnosis is the demonstration of amastigotes in the smears of tissue aspirates. Another commonly used test in the detection of antibodies to a recombinant antigen called rk39 by rapid immunochromatographic test.
Amphotericin B is the first-line drug used in India. other drugs useful in treating the condition are sodium stibogluconate, meglumine antimoniate, paromomycin, and miltefosine.",,A,
Q11,Incorrect statement regarding the management of frostbite:,"a)Amputation in severe cases
b)Rewarming is done
c)Antibiotics and analgesics not used
d)The area is dried and cleaned","The incorrect statement regarding management of frost bite is statement 3, since antibiotics and analgesics are useful for a patient with frost bite.
In frostbite, tissue damage results from severe environmental cold exposure or from direct
contact with a very cold object. Tissue injury results from both freezing and vascular stasis. It
usually affects the distal aspects of the extremities or exposed parts of the face, such as the ears, nose, chin, and cheeks.
clinical features include decreased sensation (especially for pain, and temperature sensations) in the acral tips and extremities. Affected area appears waxy, mottled, or violaceous. patients may    have a wood-like sensation in the affected area.
Treatment:
• Initial treatment is by rapid rewarming (or thawing), which is accomplished by immersion of the affected part in a water bath at temperatures of 37°–4o°c (99°–1o4°F) for 3o–6o min. Rewarming by exercise, rubbing, or friction is not advised.
• Analgesics such as ibuprofen are often required during rewarming.
• Antithrombotics, thrombolytics and vasodilators such as prostacyclin can be given to improve circulation after rewarming.
• Frost bites are associated with an increased risk of infections and tetanus. Therefore, the injured area should be cleaned with soap or antiseptic, and sterile dressings should be applied. Tetanus
prophylaxis must be given, but, empirical antibiotics are not recommended.
• The patient must be monitored for the development of compartment syndrome.
• Elective late amputation after imaging may be required in severe cases.

Q12,which of the following is not a cause of central cyanosis?,"a)Methemoglobinemia
b)pulmonary arteriovenous fistula
c)High altitude
d)Hypothermia","causes of central cyanosis are high altitude, methemoglobinemia, pulmonary arteriovenous fistula, certain congenital heart diseases etc.
cyanosis appears when the reduced haemoglobin concentration of the blood in the capillaries is  more than 5 g/dL. It depends on the total amount of haemoglobin in the blood and the degree of haemoglobin unsaturation. The state of the capillary circulation is also a contributing factor.
cyanosis is examined in the nail beds and mucous membranes, earlobes, lips, and fingers.
cyanosis is divided into central and peripheral types. If the oxygen saturation is reduced along
with an abnormal haemoglobin derivative it is called central cyanosis. Both the mucous
membranes and skin will be affected. Peripheral cyanosis occurs as a result of slow blood flow and increased extraction of o2 from normally saturated arterial blood.The mucous membrane of the     oral cavity and sublingual mucosa are spared. The causes are reduced cardiac output, cold
exposure, arterial and venous obstruction etc.",,D,
Q13,"A female patient presents to the hospital with palpitations. Her vitals are stable and the ECG shows the following. which of the following is used as first-line management to treat the
condition?","a)Amiodarone
b)Adenosine
c)DC cardioversion
d)primary pCI","The given clinical scenario and the EcG findings of narrow QRS complexes without P waves and    pseudo R waves in aVR lead suggest paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) and the first line of management to treat the condition is adenosine.
PSVT is a narrow QRS complex tachycardia with sudden onset and termination. They mainly
present with dizziness and palpitations. Evaluation of these patients includes monitoring of vitals and EcG.
Management is as follows:
1) when the patient is hemodynamically stable:



• A carotid sinus massage can be done. It is avoided if carotid bruit is present and if a prior history of stroke is seen.
• Valsalva maneuver is done if the patient is cooperative
• Intravenous adenosine is useful. It is avoided in patients with atrial fibrillation.
• Intravenous calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers are helpful. It can cause hypotension.
2) when the patient is hemodynamically unstable, direct current cardioversion (Dc cardioversion) should be done.
The below flowchart shows the treatment algorithm for PSVT.",4355-2752.PNG,B,4382-2765.PNG
Q14,which of the following is not a feature of Brown sequard syndrome?,"a)Complete transection of spinal cord
b)Ipsilateral loss of vibration &amp; touch
c)Contralateral loss of pain &amp; temperature
d)Ipsilateral loss of proprioception","complete transection of the spinal cord is not a feature of Brown Sequard syndrome.
Brown sequard syndrome occurs due to transection of the spinal cord only on one side. This
results in blocking of all motor functions on the side of the transection in all segments below the transection level.
Features include:
• Ipsilateral weakness - due to corticospinal tract
• Ipsilateral loss of joint position and vibration sensation - due to posterior column
• contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation - due to the spinothalamic tract involvement
• unilateral radicular pain
• Muscle atrophy or loss of deep tendon reflex may be present",,A,
Q15,which of the following drug is not used for the emergency (immediate) management of hyperkalemia?,"a)1o% calcium gluconate over 1o min
b)salbutamol nebulisation
c)Insulin-dextrose
d)Injection Mgso4","Intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSo4) is not used in the management of hyperkalemia.
Hyperkalemia is an increase in the levels of serum potassium &gt;5.5 mM. It is a medical
emergency and has to be treated when ECG changes are present or severe hyperkalemia (serum K &gt;6.5) without ECG changes.
Features include cardiac arrhythmias which include sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and asystole.
ECG shows tall and peaked T waves, widening of QRS complexes, loss of P waves and sine wave pattern.


Management is as follows
• Intravenous infusion of 1o ml of 1o% calcium gluconate for 2-3 minutes with cardiac monitoring. It helps to antagonise the cardiac effects.
• Intravenous regular insulin 1o units followed by 5omL of 5o % dextrose. This helps in shifting the plasma K+ into the cells
• Nebulisation with β2 agonists such as albuterol or salbutamol are effective.
• Cation exchange resins, diuretics and or dialysis are useful to remove the potassium.",,D,4383-2766.PNG
Q16,chronic HBV infection would be consistent with which of the following serology?,"a)1, 3, 4
b)1, 3
c)1, 2
d)1, 2, 4","Chronic HBV infection would be consistent with HBs Ag, Anti HBc Ag, and HBV DNA.
HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen) is the first marker to appear in the serum and it indicates the presence of infection. If it is persistent for more than 6 months, it is suggestive of chronic
infection.



Anti HBs are the antibodies to HBs and are seen after clearance of HBsAg or post-vaccination. Thus, it is suggestive of recovery, non-infectivity and immunity.
Anti HBc (antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen) has IgM and IgG. IgM anti-HBc is diagnostic of  acute hepatitis and it appears soon after HBs Ag. It persists for 3-6 months and can re-appear in   flare-ups. IgG anti-HBc appears during acute infection and persists indefinitely irrespective of the recovery or progression to chronic disease.
HBV DNA is a sensitive indicator for viral replication and infectivity. HBeAg also indicates viral     replication and infectivity. It appears shortly after HBs Ag and if it is persisting beyond 3 months, it is suggestive of chronic hepatitis.
Hepatitis B virus is mainly transmitted by percutaneous route followed by perinatal and sexual
transmission. chronic hepatitis B is a progression of acute hepatitis. chronic hepatitis B infection has five phases - immune tolerant phase, immune active phase, inactive HBsAg carrier state,
reactivated chronic hepatitis B phase, and HBsAg negative phase.
Treatment options include interferon, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir. prophylaxis is by hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and recombinant vaccine.",,A,4384-2767.PNG
Q17,Tongue fasciculations are seen in:,"a)Guillain-Barre syndrome
b)spinal muscular atrophy
c)Duchenne muscular dystrophy
d)Myasthenia gravis","Tongue fasciculations are seen in spinal muscle atrophy (SMA).
Spinal muscle atrophy is a lower motor neuron disease with early-onset and occurs as a result of the loss of a protein called survival motor neuron (SMN).
Features of lower motor neuron disease include flaccid paralysis, muscle atrophy,
fasciculations characterized by visible muscle twitches appearing as flickers under the skin, hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), hyporeflexia, or areflexia.
clinical forms of SMA are



• In infantile SMA, the onset is very early and rapid. It is characterized by decreased fetal
movements in the third trimester. In infancy, features include weak and floppy infant (hypotonic) and they lack muscle stretch reflex. Tongue fasciculations are typically seen in a severe form of
SMA known as werdnig-Hoffman disease. It can affect infants between o-6 months.
• Chronic childhood SMA has a slow onset and a progressive course.
• Juvenile SMA is seen in late childhood with a slow course.
Nusinersen is approved for therapy and another treatment is systemic administration of adeno-associated virus to deliver the missing SMN gene.
other options:
option A: GBS or Guillain-Barre syndrome is an autoimmune polyradiculopathy with an acute onset. It is characterized mainly by motor paralysis with or without sensory disturbances.
weakness is seen more in the legs than arms. other features include pain, bladder dysfunction,    affected deep tendon reflexes, and proprioception. Hypotension and arrhythmias can also be seen
option C: Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an x-linked recessive disorder due to mutation in the dystrophin gene. Typical features include proximal muscle weakness in lower extremities, calf
muscle hypertrophy, intellectual disability, and heart failure. Myalgia without weakness and myoglobinuria can also be present.
option D: Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder due to autoimmune damage to the acetylcholine receptors. It is characterized by weakness and muscle fatiguability. weakness    increases with usage. ocular features like ptosis and diplopia can be seen. proximal limb
weakness is also present.",,B,
Q18,"In a patient with HIV, the incorrect statement regarding prophylaxis for various organisms is ____.","a)prophylaxis for pcp is indicated when cD count is &lt;2oo cells/µL
b)stop prophylaxis for coccidioides if cD count is &gt;25o cells/µL for 6 months
c)prophylaxis for MAC is indicated when CD count is &lt;5o cells/µL
d)prophylaxis for Cryptococcus is indicated when CD count is &gt;15o cells/µL","The incorrect statement regarding prophylaxis in a patient with HIV is that prophylaxis for Cryptococcus is indicated when the CD count is &gt;15o cells/µL.
In cryptococcal infection, the indication for prophylaxis is a prior documented disease. The drugs used in prophylaxis can be oral fluconazole 2oo mg/day or itraconazole 2oo mg/day.
prophylaxis can be stopped when CD4+ T-cell count is &gt;1oo/μL and when there is no evidence of infection.",,D,
Q19,A patient presents with fever and nuchal rigidity. The resident was instructed to perform a lumbar puncture on this patient. what is the correct order of managing this patient?,"a)1,2,4,3
b)1,4,3,2
c)4,3,2,1
d)2,4,3,1","The correct order of events is 4, 3, 2, 1.
The classic clinical symptoms of fever and neck rigidity are suggestive of meningitis. other
common complaints are nausea, vomiting, and photophobia. Nuchal rigidity (“stiff neck”) is the pathognomonic sign of meningitis.
Bacterial meningitis in adults must be considered a medical emergency and requires urgent   administration of empirical antibiotic therapy. However, as part of pre-treatment evaluation, lumbar puncture and blood cultures must be sent for testing prior to initiation of antibiotics.



Therefore a guarded lumbar puncture must be performed as the first step.
once the cerebrospinal fluid samples are sent for culture and sensitivity testing, ceftriaxone
injection must be administered as the emergent next step as part of empirical antibiotic therapy.  It is recommended that antibiotic therapy is initiated within 6o minutes of the patient's arrival to the emergency room.
IV cannulation must be performed to attain intravenous access to administer fluids. Studies have shown that the administration of maintenance fluids in the initial 48 hrs of admission has
reduced the incidence of adverse sequelae. Since IV cannulation is mentioned to be done for
administering fluids, it can be done after lumbar puncture and antibiotics. Also, caution must be taken before administering fluids because there might be altered intracranial pressures.",,C,
Q20,"A female patient was clinically diagnosed to have hypothyroidism. Measurements ofthe
following parameters were obtained: TSH; combined protein levels; and total and free T3, T4, and rT3. which one of the following options represents her condition?","a)1
b)2
c)3
d)4","Laboratory investigations in a patient with hypothyroidism would show low levels of total and free T3, T4, and rT3, with high TSH levels and normal combined protein levels.
Normally, the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is released by the hypothalamus. It
stimulates the pituitary gland to release the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which in turn stimulates the thyroid gland to produce T3 and T4 hormones.
Elevated TSH with a low level of free T4 is suggestive of primary hypothyroidism.
In the case of secondary hypothyroidism, TSH levels may be low, normal, or even slightly
increased. The latter is due to the secretion of immunoactive but bio-inactive forms of TSH. The diagnosis is confirmed by the detection of a low unbound T4 level.
patients with hypothyroidism often present with tiredness, weakness, dry skin, hair loss, difficulty in concentrating, poor memory, constipation, and weight gain with poor appetite. on
examination, they may have cool peripheral extremities, puffy faces, bradycardia, and peripheral edema.
patients with hypothyroidism who have no evidence of heart disease are managed
with levothyroxine 5o to 1oo mcg daily. The goal of the treatment is to maintain TSH in the lower half of the reference range.",,D,
Q21,"A patient, who is a known case of HIV with a CD4 count of 2oo cells/cu.mm, presents with 5 days of cough and high-grade fever without chills and rigors. There is no history of diarrhea, vomiting, or nuchal rigidity. Chest x-ray is normal. what treatment will you give?","a)Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid + Azithromycin
b)Co-trimoxazole + steroids
c)Co-trimoxazole only
d)Antitubercular treatment","The clinical scenario of an HIV-infected patient with a CD4 count of 2oo/mm3 with fever, cough, and a normal chest x-ray is indicative of underlying pneumocystis pneumonia. pneumocystis
jirovecii pneumonia (pCp) is an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. It is treated with co-trimoxazole.
patients usually present with fever and nonproductive cough. It can also affect other organs like lymph nodes, spleen, and liver.
The classic radiographic appearance is likely normal or could consist of faint bilateral interstitial infiltrates. perihilar infiltrates are less common in patients with AIDS. CT will show diffuse
ground-glass opacities.



Histopathology of the tissue will show foamy alveolar infiltrate and mononuclear interstitial
infiltrates, which is pathognomonic of PcP. specific stains like methenamine silver, toluidine blue o, or Giemsa can show the cysts. other tests that are used for the diagnosis of PcP are polymerase chain reaction, (1→3)-β-d-glucan, etc.
The treatment of PcP is with cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole).
For patients with a Pao2 &lt;7o mmHg or with an arterial-alveolar (a–A) gradient &gt;35 mmHg, adjunct glucocorticoid therapy should be used in addition to cotrimoxazole. As the clinical stem   does not indicate poor oxygenation, steroid therapy does not have to be initiated. (option B)
Atovaquone, pentamidine, and primaquine + clindamycin are alternative agents for the treatment of PcP.
other options
option A - Amoxicillin with azithromycin is used for the empirical management of bacterial pneumonia on an outpatient basis. Bacterial pneumonia, however, tends to present with
consolidation on chest x-ray, which is not seen in this patient.
Below is an image of bacterial pneumonia showing consolidation on x-ray:


option D: Antitubercular therapy would be indicated if tuberculosis was suspected in the patient. Tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients can be seen in relatively high cD4 counts and typically
presents with fever, cough, weight loss, night sweats, and an abnormal chest x-ray revealing upper lobe cavitary disease.",,C,4387-2768.PNG
Q22,The following clinical examination was performed. what lesion would cause an exaggerated reflex?,"a)Polyneuropathy
b)Radiculopathy
c)upper motor neuron
d)Lower motor neuron","The examination being performed is the ankle jerk reflex, also known as the Achilles reflex. Upper motor neuron (UMN) lesions are associated with exaggerated deep tendon reflexes.
Hyperreflexia is a feature of UMN nerve injury. There may be an acute decrease in reflexes, but this is normally followed by hyperreflexia. LMN lesions on the other hand will present with



depressed reflexes.
UMNs refer to corticospinal tract neurons and brainstem neurons that control spinal motor neurons. Injury to UMNs leads to:
• Spasticity
• Hypertonia
• Hyperreflexia

Q23,"A 65-year-old female patient weighing 6o kg is on mechanical ventilation for ARDS secondary to urosepsis. The respiratory parameters are as follows: tidal volume- 36o mL; frequency- 3o   breaths/min; PEEP- 5 cm of H2o; and Fio2- 9o%. The arterial blood gas findings are as
follows: pao2- 5o mmHg; paCo2- 38 mmHg; and pH- 7.38. what is the next step?","a)Reduce Fio2
b)Increase tidal volume
c)Increase respiratory rate
d)Increase PEEP","Increasing PEEP in this patient would be the next step in ensuring adequate oxygenation.
Applying adequate PEEP can improve arterial oxygenation by reducing ventilation-perfusion (v/Q) mismatch in areas of atelectasis.
This patient's low pao2 and low pao2/Fio2 ratio are suggestive of impaired oxygenation. The
ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Pao2/Fio2) is ≤3oo mmHg as assessed on 5 cm H2o of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous
positive airway pressure (CPAP). In this patient the ratio is ≤1oo mmHg, implying that the PEEP of 5 cm H2o is insufficient and must be increased.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most severe type of acute lung injury
characterized by poor oxygenation, pulmonary infiltrates, and acuity of onset. It is associated with capillary endothelial injury and diffuse alveolar damage.



Etiology for ARDS:
• Direct lung injury- pneumonia, aspiration of gastric contents, pulmonary contusion,
near-drowning, toxic inhalational injury
• Indirect lung injury- sepsis, severe trauma like multiple bone fractures, flail chest, head trauma, burns, multiple transfusions, drug overdose, pancreatitis, post-cardiopulmonary bypass
ARDS is characterized by the development of dyspnea and hypoxemia, which progressively worsens within 6 to 27 hours of the initial provoking event.
Recommended therapies in ARDS with clinical or supportive evidence:
• The low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) strategy (4–6 mL/kg of ideal body weight) is
recommended to maintain adequate ventilation and avoid ventilator-induced lung injury by barotrauma and volume trauma.
• High positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or open lung mechanical ventilation
• Prone position
• Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMo)
other options:
option A: Reducing Fio2 will further worsen the patient's arterial oxygen as Pao2/Fio2 is ≤1oo mmHg.
option B: The LTVV strategy recommends a goal of 4–6 mL/kg of ideal body weight. The tidal
volume setting in this patient is already at a goal of 6 mL/kg and further increasing it without first recruiting atelectatic lung tissue, would increase the risk of volume trauma.
option C: Increasing the respiratory rate is an acceptable measure in the event of acute
respiratory acidosis. The results of arterial blood gas analysis in this patient do not reflect
acidosis. Furthermore, since the respiratory rate is already set at 3o breaths/min, increasing it further can worsen the risk of barotrauma and hyperinflation.",,D,
Q24,Identify the conduction abnormality from the ECG given below.,"a)First degree heart block
b)ventricular tachycardia
c)Third degree heart block
d)second degree heart block","The ECG shown above is the second-degree atrioventricular block type 1 - wenckebach
phenomenon.
Second Degree Heart Block: It occurs due to the intermittent failure of electrical impulse
conduction from the atrium to the ventricle. It is characterized by a missed QRS. It is oftwo types:
• Mobitz type 1/ wenckebach occurs due to the decremental conduction of electrical impulses in    the AV node. It is characterized by a progressive PR elongation leading to an eventual drop in the QRS complex. This may be seen in young athletes.





• Mobitz type 2 occurs in the distal or infra-His conduction system and is often associated with
intraventricular conduction delays. It is characterized by an intermittent failure of conduction of    the p wave without any change in the preceding impulses. on ECG there is a fixed PR interval and missed QRS.",4359-2755.PNG,D,4390-2770.PNG;4390-2771.PNG
Q25,"An elderly male patient was brought by his son because he was not using his left arm for
day-to-day functioning. He has an unkempt appearance on the left side of his body and has a history of bumping into door frames while walking through them. The evaluation performed  is shown below. where does a lesion in the brain cause this presentation?","a)Right parietotemporal
b)Left parietal
c)Right parietal
d)Right premotor cortex","The presentation shown in the clinical stem and image is suggestive of hemispatial neglect.
Hemispatial neglect is the inability to report, respond, or orient to stimuli in one-half of the space despite having no motor or sensory deficits. It is primarily associated with lesions in the
non-dominant parietal lobe i.e. right parietal lobe.
Contralateral hemispatial neglect is due to the damage of cortical or subcortical components of the parieto-frontal network for spatial orientation.



The right hemisphere directs attention within the entire extrapersonal space - both the right and left side, while the left hemisphere directs attention mostly within the contralateral right
hemispace.
Thus, left hemisphere lesions do not give rise to much neglect because of the intact right hemisphere. Severe neglect for the right hemispace is rare, even in left-handers with left hemisphere lesions.
Right hemisphere lesions, however, give rise to severe left hemispatial neglect because the  unaffected left hemisphere does not contain ipsilateral attentional mechanisms and cannot compensate.
The features of parietal lobe lesions are as follows:
• Apraxia
• Acalculia
• Alexia
• Agnosia
• Neglect
• Inferior quadrantic homonymous hemianopia.
Two bedside tests can be used to evaluate neglect: simultaneous bilateral stimulation and visual target cancellation.
• In simultaneous bilateral stimulation, when the examiner provides unilateral or simultaneous bilateral stimulation in the visual, auditory, or tactile modalities, patients have no difficulty
detecting unilateral stimuli on either side but perceive the bilaterally presented stimulus as coming only from one side. This phenomenon is known as extinction.
• In visual target cancellation, the patient fails to detect the targets on one-half of the field in target-detection tasks.",4359-2754.PNG,C,
Q26,"A young man is brought to the hospital with high-grade fever and altered consciousness. on   examination, he had neck rigidity and pain when bending the neck. A lumbar puncture was    performed, which showed a WBc count of 45 cells/μL, majorly being lymphocytes, elevated    pressure with protein of 12o mg/dL, and glucose level of 7o mg/dL. How will you manage the index case?","a)piperacillin + tazobactam
b)vancomycin + ceftriaxone
c)Amphotericin B + flucytosine
d)Antitubercular therapy","The clinical symptoms along with the cerebrospinal fluid analysis of elevated pressure and
proteins, normal glucose levels, and lymphocyte predominance suggests a diagnosis of fungal meningitis. cryptococcal meningitis, one of the most common causes of fungal meningitis is   managed with amphotericin B + flucytosine.
In cryptococcal meningitis, there is lymphocytic predominance in the cSF analysis of white blood cells.
cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungus that is found worldwide as a saprophyte
in soil enriched with pigeon droppings. It may cause infection in immunocompetent individuals, resulting in a flu-like illness with complete recovery.
Infection in immunocompromised people like AIDS patients or patients with hematological malignancies results in meningoencephalitis.



pathogenic varieties of cryptococcus, including c. neoformans and cryptococcus gattii,
are laccase positive and have the ability to grow at 37°c. These factors are used to differentiate them from non-pathogenic cryptococci.


The primary pulmonary infection may be asymptomatic or may mimic an influenza-like
respiratory infection, often resolving spontaneously. cutaneous infection results in ulcers and granulomata.
In immunocompromised individuals, the yeasts may multiply and disseminate to other parts of
the body, but preferentially to the cNS, causing cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, which presents with headache and nuchal rigidity.
Diagnosis is established by the microscopic examination of cerebrospinal fluid, which
shows gram-positive round budding yeast cells on gram staining (option B). Also, India ink preparation reveals capsulated budding yeast cells.

Q27,"The absence of loud S1 in mitral stenosis would indicate all of the following, except ______.","a)calcified valve
b)Aortic regurgitation
c)First degree heart block
d)Mild mitral stenosis","The early phases of mitral stenosis typically show a loud S1 (first heart sound).
The loud S1 is due to the greater distance covered by the leaflets during closure since elevated left atrial pressure has kept the leaflets relatively wide apart. The S1 becomes softer in the later stages of MS when the leaflets are rigid and get calcified (option A)
The first heart sound (S1) includes mitral and tricuspid valve closure. The intensity of S1 is determined by the
• distance over which the leaflet of the valve must travel to return to its annular plane
• LV contractility
• PR interval
causes of loud S1
• Early mitral stenosis
• Hyperadrenergic states (thyrotoxicosis, anxiety, anemia, pregnancy, exercise)
• Short PR interval
Soft/ low intensity of S1 is caused by states that cause the AV valves to close prior to ventricular systole or due to a reduction in rate of development of pressure in the ventricles. The causes of  soft S1 are:
• First-degree heart block (option c)
• Mitral regurgitation
• Aortic regurgitation (option B)
• Attenuation due to increased tissue between the heart and chest wall (obesity, obstructive lung disease, pericardial effusion)
• calcified Mitral stenosis
• Left ventricular contractile dysfunction
• Beta-receptor blockers",,D,
Q28,"A patient presents with perioral numbness, tingling, and tetany. All the following conditions can lead to this, except _____.","a)vitamin D toxicity
b)Acute pancreatitis
c)chronic kidney disease
d)Hypoparathyroidism","The above clinical scenario of a patient presenting with perioral paresthesias and tetany is
suggestive of hypocalcemia. Vitamin D toxicity does not cause hypocalcemia but rather leads to hypercalcemia.
Vitamin D toxicity occurs due to excessive intake of vitamin D supplements, usually in amounts of &gt;4o,ooo–1oo,ooo IU/day. The symptoms are mainly due to hypercalcemia. Laboratory
investigations will show elevated serum vitamin-D levels (&gt;1oo ng/mL) and calcium.



In such patients, vitamin D supplements should be discontinued immediately, along with
restricted exposure to the sun and avoiding calcium supplements. since vitamin D is stored in the body for a long time, the symptoms may persist for some days even after stopping the intake.
causes of hypocalcemia
• Pancreatitis (sequestration of the calcium via chelation with free fatty acids)
• Renal failure/chronic kidney disease (impaired 1,25(OH)2D production)
• Pancreatic and small bowel fistulas
• Hypoparathyroidism (PTH is the main defense against hypocalcemia)
• Abnormalities in magnesium levels
• Tumor lysis syndrome
symptoms and signs of hypocalcemia may be circumoral or digital numbness, paresthesia,
laryngeal spasms, and cardiac arrhythmias. Given below are two named signs of hypocalcemia.
• chvostek sign: This is elicited by gently tapping over the facial nerve in front of the tragus of the ear. There is hyperexcitability of the facial muscles, manifesting as a contraction of the muscles.
• Trousseau sign: This is elicited by making the forearm ischemic by applying a
sphygmomanometer cuff to the arm and keeping the pressure above systolic blood pressure (sBP) for 5 minutes. The hand goes into a painful carpopedal spasm and assumes the accoucheur’s hand position (shown in the image below).
The below image shows Trousseau's sign:


Acute symptomatic hypocalcemia is an emergency and must be treated with:
• 1o mL of 1o% calcium gluconate is given slowly through the intravenous route.
• calcium and vitamin D replacement is given orally.
• Magnesium supplementation may also be required due to the synergistic actions of calcium and magnesium.



Calcitonin and bisphosphonates are used in cases of severe toxicity causing hypercalcemia. some patients might require glucocorticoids, which lower plasma calcium levels by reducing calcium
absorption from the intestines and increasing its urinary excretion.",,A,4394-2774.PNG
Q29,"Thrombolysis can be considered in all of these conditions, except _________.","a)MRI showing density in less than 1/3rd of the area supplied by MCA

c)Ischemic stroke within 2 hours
d)onset of symptoms &lt;4 hours","Thrombolysis is contraindicated if blood pressure is greater than 185/11o mmHg. Blood pressure must be lowered before considering thrombolysis.
Thrombolysis refers to the dissolution of the intravascular clots to prevent ischemic damage and improve blood flow.

Q30,serologic findings of a patient with hepatitis are given below.,"a)High HDV viral load
b)High HBV viral load
c)presence of IgM anti HDV antibodies
d)Absence of anti HBc IgG antibodies","Anti-HBc IgG antibodies are markers of a chronic hepatitis B infection. Its presence along with
Anti HDV antibodies suggests a superinfection of HDV on chronic HBV. Therefore the absence of Anti HBc IgG antibodies is an indication of an acute episode of hepatitis which is associated with  HBV/HDV (hepatitis B/hepatitis D) coinfection.
HBV/HDV coinfection occurs when a person simultaneously becomes infected with both HBV and HDV. In acute hepatitis, simultaneous infection with HBV and HDV can lead to mild-to-severe
hepatitis. The signs and symptoms typically appear 3–7 weeks after the initial infection and
include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, pale-coloured stools, jaundice (yellow eyes), and even fulminant hepatitis. However, recovery is usually complete. Co-infection     usually ends with recovery and viral eradication (&lt;5% chronicity).
HDV superinfection occurs when a person who is already chronically infected with HBV acquires   HDV. The infection of HDV on chronic hepatitis B can accelerate the progression to severe disease in all ages with progression to cirrhosis almost a decade earlier than in HBV mono-infected
persons. The outcome is usually persistent infection with 8o% progressing to chronicity.
Diagnosis of HDV infection is by detecting high levels of anti-HDV immunoglobulin G (IgG) and   immunoglobulin M (IgM). It is confirmed by the detection of HDV RNA in serum and their levels are not helpful in differentiating between acute and chronic infections. There is no specific
treatment for HDV infection. Pegylated interferon alpha may be used (with limited efficacy).",,D,
Q31,A patient was brought following an RTA. He was found to have an incomplete lesion of the spinal cord. what would be seen if the central part of the cord was involved?,"a)1 and 4
b)2 and 3
c)2 and 4
d)1 and 3","In this patient with central cord syndrome, LMN lesion of upper limbs and trunk, UMN oflower limbs, bladder and bowel involvement will be seen.



Central cord syndrome occurs due to damage to the central region of the spinal cord. It results from selective damage to the grey matter nerve cells and the decussating spinothalamic
tracts surrounding the central canal. These decussating fibers carry crude touch, pain, and temperature sensations.
It commonly occurs due to hyperextension of the cervical spine, causing the spinal cord to
compress between the vertebral body and ligamentum flavum. spinal trauma, syringomyelia, and intrinsic cord tumors are the other causes.
This condition affects the cervical cord producing arm weakness &gt; leg weakness.
There is dissociated sensory loss, i.e, loss of crude touch, pain, and temperature senses
with a preserved light touch, proprioception, and vibration sense over the shoulders, lower
neck, and upper trunk (cape distribution). There is bilateral lower motor neuron paralysis and muscular atrophy in the segment of the lesion.
Eventually, expansion of the cavity may lead to compression of the long tracts. This results
in spasticity and weakness with loss of pain, temperature, light touch, and pressure sensations occurring below the level of the lesion. There is a characteristic sacral sparing.
Bowel and bladder dysfunction and Horner's syndrome may also be seen in cases of central cord syndrome.

The New York Heart Association (NYHA) has outlined criteria that may be used to classify patients with heart disease based on their functional disability.
NYHA Classification of Heart Failure:



The Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea scale is used to classify the severity of symptoms in respiratory diseases, specifically COpD.
Modified MRC (mMRC) Dyspnea scale:

b)sublentiform
c)Anterior limb
d)posterior limb","The posterior limb of the internal capsule is affected in hemiplegia/ hemiparesis due to ischaemic stroke.
Motor fibers (cortico-spinal tract) supplying the extremities are present in the posterior limb, hence a lesion in this region may cause hemiplegia.
The types of lacunar syndromes are as follows:
• pure motor hemiparesis - infarct in the posterior limb of the internal capsule
• pure sensory stroke - infarct in the thalamus
• Ataxic hemiparesis - infarct in the pons or internal capsule
• Dysarthria and clumsy hand syndrome - infarction in the pons or internal capsule.",,D,4394-2774-1.png
Q34,An increased anion gap is seen in _______.,"a)Respiratory acidosis
b)Respiratory alkalosis
c)Metabolic acidosis
d)Metabolic alkalosis","An increased anion gap is seen in metabolic acidosis.
Normally, in the serum, the total number of cations is equal to the total number of anions. But, a  few of the anions (lactate, phosphate, and sulfate) cannot be measured, and this is called an anion gap.
Anion gap (AG) = [Na+] - [cl-+HcO3-] The normal anion gap is 6-12 mEq/L.
when acid anions, such as acetoacetate and lactate, accumulate in extracellular fluid, the AG
increases, causing a high-AG acidosis. Metabolic acidosis with an increased serum anion gap is
seen if the anion gap is &gt;12 mEq/L. It occurs in conditions such as methanol poisoning, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis, paracetamol poisoning, lactic acidosis, salicylate poisoning, etc.
A high anion gap indicates metabolic acidosis. when metabolic acidosis and metabolic alkalosis coexist in the same patient, the pH may be in the normal range. In this circumstance, the
presence of a high AG helps identify the presence of metabolic acidosis.",,C,
Q35,"A young patient presents to the clinic with erythematous lesions over the exposed areas of the skin like hands, arms, chest, etc. she also complains of arthralgia and breathlessness. which   among the following antibodies will be useful in diagnosing this condition?","a)Antihistone antibodies
b)Anti dsDNA antibodies
c)Anticentromere antibodies
d)Antinuclear antibodies","The clinical scenario of a patient with a photosensitive rash, arthralgias, and shortness of breath is suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Anti-dsDNA antibodies are specific for the
diagnosis of SLE.
SLE is an autoimmune disorder that results in damage to multiple organs and organ systems in the body most commonly seen in women of reproductive age.
clinical and immunological manifestations of SLE:



• skin
• acute, subacute cutaneous manifestations (photosensitivity, malar or maculopapular rash)
• chronic cutaneous manifestations (discoid lupus, panniculitis, lichen planus-like)
• oral or nasal ulcers
• Non-scarring alopecia
• synovitis involving ≥2 joints
• serositis (pleurisy, pericarditis)
• Renal:
• Protein/Creatinine ratio &gt;o.5
• RBC casts
• Neurologic: seizures, psychosis, myelitis, neuropathy, confusional state
• Hemolytic anemia

• Anti-dsDNA &gt;reference value (specific)
• Anti-smith antibody (specific)
• Antiphospholipid antibody (lupus anticoagulant, false-positive rapid plasma reagin)
• Low serum complement
To diagnose sLE, at least 4 out of 11 of the above criteria must be positive. However, if a renal
biopsy is suggestive of lupus nephritis and lupus autoantibodies are positive then four criteria are not required.

Q36,"Based on the ECG given below, which of the following drugs is not used in the management of the condition?","a)Metoprolol
b)Amiodarone
c)Adenosine
d)Diltiazem","The given ECG findings of an irregularly irregular rhythm, absent p waves, and narrow QRs
complexes are suggestive of atrial fibrillation(AF). Adenosine is not used. Intravenous adenosine administration has been found to provoke spontaneous AF in 12-16% of patients.
Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia. There is rapid and irregular atrial
activation which is transmitted through the atrioventricular node. The conducted ventricular rate is usually rapid and irregularly irregular. It can vary from 11o-16o beats/minute. A pulse deficit is an important clinical finding associated with the condition. This arises due to preload reduction.
symptoms include palpitations, fatigue, presyncope, and dyspnea. An ECG shows the absence of P waves.



In acute atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic instability, electrical or chemical cardioversion is the first step. The latter is done by intravenous administration of class III antiarrhythmic - ibutilide.    In a stable patient, ventricular rate control is the primary aim. This is done by intravenous or oral  administration of beta-blockers (metoprolol). Calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and
diltiazem can also be used.
If the current episode duration is &gt;48 hours, cardioversion can precipitate thromboembolic complications. In such cases, cardioversion should be carried out only after 3 weeks of
anticoagulation. It has to be continued for 4 weeks after cardioversion. Another option is to evaluate the presence of a thrombus in the left atrial appendage. This can be done either by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or high-resolution CT.
If the duration is &lt;48 hours and there are no high-risk factors, cardioversion can be done. The CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system is used to assess stroke risk.
warfarin is recommended in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves who present with atrial fibrillation. In mitral stenosis, thrombi arise frequently from the dilated left atrium. Atrial fibrillation in the absence of mitral stenosis is known as nonvalvular atrial
fibrillation. oral factor xa inhibitors such as apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban can be used in such cases.",4363-2757.PNG,C,4400-2776.PNG
Q37,"A patient presented with violent, flinging movements. where is the lesion causing the hemiballismus seen?","a)putamen
b)subthalamic nucleus
c)Caudate nucleus
d)Globus pallidus","The above clinical scenario is suggestive of hemiballismus. A lesion in the subthalamic nuclei is responsible for this condition.
A lesion in the subthalamic nucleus causes sudden, violent, involuntary, and flinging
movements confined to one side of the body, commonly affecting the proximal muscles of the
limbs, a condition called hemiballismus. The movements are seen contralateral to the side of the lesion, i.e., involuntary movements of the right arm and leg are seen in the lesion of the left
subthalamic nucleus and vice versa.





Basal ganglia circuits have both direct and indirect pathways. The direct pathway stimulates the cortex to produce movement, whereas the indirect pathway inhibits it. The striatal activity in
the direct pathway is mediated by D1 dopamine receptors and in the indirect pathway by D2 dopamine receptors.
The subthalamic nucleus is a part of the indirect pathway. Hence, a lesion at subthalamic nuclei leads to loss of inhibitory effect of the indirect pathway resulting in dopaminergic overactivity.   This is responsible for features of hemiballismus.
This movement disorder is usually self-limiting and tends to resolve spontaneously after weeks or months. Dopamine antagonistic agents can be given to manage it as well.
other options:
options A and C: A lesion in the putamen and caudate nucleus can give rise to chorea. Chorea is defined as rapid, semi-purposeful, graceful, dance-like nonpatterned involuntary movements
involving distal or proximal muscle groups.
option D: A lesion in the globus pallidus can give rise to athetosis. This involves spontaneous and continuous writhing movements of the hand, arm, neck, or face.",,B,4401-2777.PNG
Q38,"An elderly female patient with a history of severe vomiting was treated aggressively for severe dehydration at an outside hospital. one week later, she became mute, quadriplegic, and rigid. what is the most likely reason?","a)Malignant hyperthermia
b)severe catatonia
c)Rapid sodium correction
d)Neuroleptic malignant syndrome","severe/ intractable vomiting is a common cause of hyponatremia. The development of
quadriplegia, mutism, and rigidity after treatment is suggestive of rapid correction of
hyponatremia, leading to central pontine myelinolysis (CPM). It is a complication associated with the treatment of hyponatremia and can present a few days after the initial correction, as seen in    this patient.
Rapid correction of hyponatremia (at a rate of &gt;8–1o mM in 24 hours or 18 mM in 48 hours) causes hypertonic stress, leading to apoptosis and cell death. Demyelination without
inflammation occurs at the base of the pons with the relative sparing of axons and nerve cells.



CPM, better known now as osmotic demyelination syndrome, commonly involves the pons; but it may also cause extrapontine myelinolysis, affecting the cerebellum, putamen, thalamus, or lateral geniculate bodies. This can result in quadriparesis, dysphagia, dysarthria, diplopia, mutism,
ataxia, parkinsonism, and catatonia.
MRI is useful in establishing the diagnosis and may also identify partial forms that present as confusion, dysarthria, and/or disturbances of conjugate gaze without paraplegia.
Prevention of CPM depends on therapeutic guidelines for the restoration of severe hyponatremia which should aim for gradual correction i.e. at a rate of ≤1o mmol/L (1o mEq/L) within 24 h
and ≤2o mmol/L (2o mEq/L) within 48 h.
The image shows the MRI finding of central pontine myelinolysis with axial fat-saturated T2-weighted MRI showing a hyperintense signal in the central pons.


option A: Malignant hyperthermia is a condition in which the patient develops sustained muscle contraction and hyperthermia. It occurs following the administration of succinylcholine and
other inhaled anesthetics like halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane, etc.
option B: Catatonia is a clinical syndrome characterized by striking behavioral abnormalities such as stupor, mutism, and posturing.
option D: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a life-threatening adverse effect of
antipsychotics characterized by increased pulse and blood pressure; motor and behavioral
symptoms such as muscular rigidity and dystonia, akinesia, and agitation; and autonomic
symptoms like hyperthermia. Laboratory findings include an increased white blood cell count and increased levels of creatine phosphokinase, plasma myoglobin, and myoglobinuria.",,C,4136-2658.PNG
Q39,which of the following is seen in MEN 2B syndrome?,"a)cafe au lait spot
b)Medullary thyroid carcinoma
c)parathyroid adenoma
d)optic nerve glioma","Medullary thyroid carcinoma is seen in multiple endocrine neoplasia 2B (MEN 2B) syndrome. Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) describes conditions with tumors involving two or more
endocrine glands. There are four types - MEN 1-4. They have an autosomal dominant pattern of



inheritance and can also be sporadic.
MEN type 2 comprises groups of disorders caused by gain-of-function mutations of the RET proto-oncogene at chromosomal locus 1oq11.2. There are three variants:
• MEN 2A, also known as MEN 2 (most common type)
• MEN 2B, also known as MEN 3
• MTC only
MEN 2A is also known as sipple's syndrome. It is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytomas, and parathyroid tumors.
In MEN 2B along with MTC and pheochromocytoma, it is associated with other abnormalities such as mucosal neuromas, marfanoid habitus, medullated corneal nerve fibers, and
megacolon. parathyroid tumors are generally not seen here, in contrast to the MEN 2A type.
MTC presents early and is usually aggressive. MTC is the most common feature, presents as a palpable mass in the neck, and can be associated with pressure symptoms. Ectopic
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secreted by the tumor can cause Cushing's syndrome.
pheochromocytoma is frequently bilateral. palpitations, sweating, and headaches are the features of pheochromocytoma.
Mucosal neuromas can present with bumpy and enlarged lips, tongue, and eyelids. Intestinal
autonomic ganglion dysfunction can lead to megacolon and diverticula. Medullated corneal fibers and delayed puberty can also be seen. Marfanoid habitus marked by tall stature, long limbs,
arachnodactyly, and joint hypermobility is an associated feature.

b)Amoxicillin-clavulanate
c)Ceftriaxone
d)Nitrofurantoin","A diabetic patient with a urinary tract infection, now presenting with hypotension unresponsive to IV fluids is suggestive of urosepsis (septic shock). Hence, the patient should be treated with
piperacillin-Tazobactam. In septic shock, there is peripheral vasodilation due to toxins from the infectious agent causing endothelial injury and fluid leak, leading to hypotension which can be   refractory to fluid therapy in the early stages.
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are more common in diabetic patients due to poor metabolic
control, altered immune status, poor bladder control and incomplete voiding. E.coli is the most     common organism to cause urinary tract infections. other organisms causing infections include    klebsiella spp, proteus spp, Enterobacter spp and Enterococci. They are more prone to resistance



to common antibiotics used in uncomplicated urinary tract infections. UTIs can range from asymptomatic bacteriuria, cystitis, pyelonephritis and complicated urosepsis.
other options:
option B: Amoxiclav is used for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections and skin and  soft tissue infections. Though most cases of UTI are caused by E.coli, due to increased resistance
(ESBL-producing strains), it can be challenging to treat with oral beta-lactams and generally, they have lower cure rates compared to other classes of drugs such as fluoroquinolones or
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
option C: when a patient with uncomplicated pyelonephritis is treated with
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and organism susceptibility is unknown, ceftriaxone 1 gram IV can be used initially.
option D: Nitrofurantoin is used for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis.
Factors that suggest a complicated urinary tract infection:
• Functional or anatomic abnormality of the urinary tract
• Male gender
• Diabetes
• Elderly
• Immunosuppression
• Childhood urinary tract infection
• Recent antimicrobial usage
• Indwelling urinary catheter
• Urinary tract instrumentation
• Hospital-acquired infection
• Symptoms more than 7 days at presentation.",,A,
Q42,"A patient with diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease has elevated serum
creatinine and urea levels. which of the following oral hypoglycemic agents is safe to use?","a)Glimepiride
b)Exenatide
c)vildagliptin
d)Linagliptin","Linagliptin does not require dose adjustment with renal failure as it is cleared primarily by the hepatobiliary system and hence no adjustment is needed in renal failure.
Glimepiride (option A) is a second-generation sulfonylurea which is excreted by the kidneys and hence cannot be used in renal failure. Vildagliptin (option C) and other DPP-4 inhibitors
(saxagliptin, sitagliptin, and alogliptin) are largely excreted by the kidneys and cannot be used in    chronic renal failure. Exenatide (option B) is a GLP-1 agonist which is excreted by the kidneys and hence cannot be used in renal failure.
Linagliptin is a dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor used in type 2 diabetes as monotherapy or in combination therapy when metformin is not tolerated or contraindicated. It binds
extensively to plasma proteins and is cleared primarily by the hepatobiliary system. Hence, no dose adjustment is needed in renal failure.



oral semaglutide is the first oral GLP-1 agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
mellitus, available as 3 mg, 7 mg and 14 mg tablets. unlike most DPP-4 inhibitors, it is not
eliminated by renal clearance and can be used in patients with renal impairment. Patients should be advised to take the tablet 3o minutes before food intake. side effects include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. some trials have shown semaglutide to be associated with an increased risk  of gallbladder disease.",,D,
Q43,A hypertensive patient who is on losartan develops a HBA1c level of 8.1%. which of the following drugs would you replace losartan with?,"a)Amlodipine
b)Telmisartan
c)Metoprolol
d)olmesartan","A hypertensive patient developing diabetes should be switched to telmisartan.
Telmisartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), has shown evidence of having PPAR-gamma agonist action. It is very useful in hypertensive patients with diabetes. PPAR-gamma agonists are the thiazolidinedione group of drugs that act by inducing several insulins sensitizing genes,
thereby reducing overall insulin resistance.
ACE inhibitors or ARBs are the first-line treatment of choice for hypertension in a diabetic

Q46,what is the most common site of abdominal tuberculosis?,"a)Rectum
b)colon
c)small intestine
d)Ileocecal junction","The most common site of abdominal tuberculosis is the ileocaecal junction.
Amongst extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB), abdominal TB is a relatively uncommon form that
may occur due to direct seeding by swallowing of sputum, hematogenous spread, or ingestion of    milk from cows with bovine TB. It most commonly involves the terminal ileum and caecal regions, though any part of the gastrointestinal tract may be involved.
clinical features include abdominal pain, palpable mass, hematochezia, and obstruction, along with symptoms characteristic of TB such as fever, weight loss, and night sweats.
The characteristic findings on barium meal and follow-through are strictures, narrow ileum, and high subhepatic cecum.

tuberculosis with narrowing of terminal ileum, ileocaecal junction, and dilated proximal ileum:",,D,4408-2781-1.png
Q47,An 11-year-old child diagnosed with acute rheumatic fever and having no valvular pathology comes to your clinic. what is the duration of prophylaxis given to this child?,"a)5 years
b)4o years
c)1o years
d)2o years","The duration of prophylaxis given to this child is 1o years.
The given scenario is a case of acute rheumatic fever without carditis and no valvular pathology. The secondary prophylaxis for this child is given for 5 years or till the age of 21, whichever is
longer. since the boy is 11 years old, prophylaxis for 1o years till the age of 21 years is longer than 5 years.
ARF is an autoimmune disease that develops in response to group A streptococcal infection. It is commonly seen in children between the age of 5-14 years. An upper respiratory tract infection
with some M serotypes of the organism is the trigger. The concept of molecular mimicry is used to explain the pathogenesis of the condition.
since one attack of ARF increases the risk for further episodes and development of RHD,
secondary prophylaxis is recommended by the American heart association (AHA) as follows:
• Rheumatic fever without carditis: For 5 years after the last attack or till 21 years of age (whichever is longer).
• Rheumatic fever with carditis but no residual valvular disease: For 1o years after the last attack or till 21 years of age (whichever is longer).
• Rheumatic fever with persistent valvular disease, evident clinically or on echocardiography: For 1o years after the last attack or till the age of 4o (whichever is longer). sometimes lifelong
prophylaxis can be given.
symptoms usually present after a latent period of about three weeks. Indolent carditis and chorea are the exceptions that can present even six months later. Migratory asymmetric
polyarthritis which affects large joints and high-grade fever are common features. cutaneous
manifestations include erythema marginatum and subcutaneous nodules. sydenham's chorea is commonly found in females and frequently affects the head and upper limbs. Acute rheumatic   carditis can be seen as the involvement of the endocardium, myocardium, or pericardium.

b)Metabolic acidosis with high anion gap
c)Metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap
d)Metabolic alkalosis with normal anion gap","Methanol intoxication is characterized by metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap.



Methanol is metabolized in the body as follows:
Methanol -Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH)→ Formaldehyde -Aldehyde Dehydrogenase→ Formic acid
Formic acid is an unmeasured anion causing a high-anion gap and metabolic acidosis. It accumulates in the cNS and retina and causes blurring vision/loss of vision.
other causes of high-anion gap metabolic acidosis:
• Lactic acidosis
• ketoacidosis: alcohol, starvation, diabetes
• Toxins: Ethylene glycol, methanol, salicylate
• Renal failure (acute and chronic)",,B,
Q49,"A woman presents with altered sensorium, breathlessness, hypotension, and bradycardia.    Examination revealed non-pitting edema of the extremities. she has a long-standing history of weight gain, constipation, cold intolerance, and menorrhagia. what is the most likely
diagnosis?","a)septic shock
b)cardiogenic shock
c)Myxedema coma
d)Hyperthyroidism","The given clinical history suggests a typical case of hypothyroidism, and the likely diagnosis is myxedema coma.
Myxedema coma is a severe neurological complication of hypothyroidism. It is primarily seen in the elderly and has a high mortality rate of 2o–4o%. It is often precipitated by the following
factors:
• Drugs like sedatives, antidepressants, and anesthetics
• Infections like pneumonia
• congestive heart failure, myocardial ischemia
• cerebrovascular accidents
• Gastrointestinal bleeding
• Exposure to cold
All these causes impair respiration. Hypoventilation and the ensuing hypoxia and hypercapnia play a major role in the pathogenesis of myxedema coma.
clinical features include altered consciousness, seizures, hypothermia (can reach 23°c), metabolic disturbances, and symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism (fatiguability, cold intolerance,
non-pitting edema, weight gain, constipation, menorrhagia, etc).
Management of myxedema coma involves:
• pharmacotherapy:
• Levothyroxine (T4): Single loading IV dose (2oo–4oo mcg) and maintenance oral dose (1.6 mcg/kg/day)
• Liothyronine (T3): Added along with T4 either via nasogastric tube or IV
• parenteral hydrocortisone (5o mg every 6 h): Given to correct the impaired levels of corticoid hormones
• Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics: Given in case of infections



• supportive therapy is by correction of associated metabolic imbalance, external warming (if body temperature is &lt;3o degrees) to prevent circulatory collapse by using space blankets,
and ventilatory support with regular blood-gas analysis in the first 48 hrs.
other options:
option A: septic shock occurs due to systemic inflammation like bacterial and fungal infections,  toxic shock syndrome, pancreatitis, massive trauma, and severe burns, resulting in organ failure. A massive release of inflammatory cytokines causes peripheral vasodilation and pooling, which    causes the skin to look flushed. vascular damage, DIC, metabolic derangements, and diffuse
alveolar damage (shock lung) can be seen.
option B: Cardiogenic shock occurs due to myocardial pump failure, resulting in low cardiac output. It is associated with conditions like myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, cardiac
tamponade, and pulmonary embolism. patients present with hypotension, a weak rapid pulse, tachypnea, and cool clammy skin.
option D: Hyperthyroidism presents with clinical features that include heat intolerance and sweating, tachycardia and palpitations, weight loss with increased appetite, diarrhea,

statement 1: Headache for &gt;4 hours can be a chronic tension-type headache or migraine, which does not require further evaluation unless associated with other warning symptoms.
statement 2: worst headache of life - patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage often describe their headache as the worst headache of their life. This condition requires further evaluation, usually a  non-contrast CT scan.
statement 3: New-onset progressive headache has a higher chance of being caused by a serious underlying cause as compared to headaches that have a similar intensity and a longstanding
history. underlying causes may include meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural or    epidural hematoma, and purulent sinusitis. Hence, these headaches need further evaluation.
statement 4: Headache with blurring of vision could be due to a variety of causes such as
migraine, increased intracranial pressure, acute angle closure glaucoma, etc. Hence, these

Q51,"A patient presents with cough, cold, fever, and malaise associated with weight loss and   ascites. A radiograph of the chest is shown below. Ascitic fluid analysis showed elevated adenosine deaminase. which of the following is the next step in management?","a)Biopsy
b)start ATT after laparotomy and stricture removal
c)start anti-tubercular therapy
d)Conservative management","This clinical vignette is suggestive of tuberculous peritonitis secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis. Anti-tubercular therapy should be started as the next step in the management of this condition.
This patient presents with cough, cold, fever, and malaise associated with weight loss, and a
radiograph showing a homogenous dense infiltrate in the right lung is consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). The presence of ascites along with the above-mentioned signs and symptoms is suggestive of tuberculous peritonitis.



The various pathogenic mechanisms of gastrointestinal TB include direct seeding into the
abdomen due to swallowing of the sputum, hematogenous seeding of tubercle bacilli from rupture of lymph nodes or intraabdominal organs, and ingestion of milk from cows infected with bovine     TB. It presents with abdominal pain, swelling, obstruction, hematochezia, and a palpable
abdominal mass. constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, night sweats, and anorexia are also present. The terminal ileum and cecum are the most commonly involved sites.
The presence of fever, abdominal pain, and ascites should raise the suspicion of tuberculous   peritonitis. The clinical presentation may be similar to crohn's disease if the intestinal wall is involved, leading to ulcerations and fistulae.
paracentesis reveals an exudate with high protein content, lymphocytosis, and elevated levels of adenosine deaminase(ADA). Elevated ADA levels have very high sensitivity for tuberculous
peritonitis. standard anti-tubercular therapy is recommended for ascites caused by tuberculous peritonitis. If the etiology of the ascites is uncertain, laparoscopy with peritoneal biopsy for
culture and histology remains the gold standard.",4368-2759.PNG,C,
Q52,"A female patient presents to the AIIMs emergency department with severe fatigue and
prostration. she is a known case of chronic stable angina. while collecting a blood sample, you notice the blood has a brownish hue. what is the underlying diagnosis?","a)Carboxy-hemoglobinemia
b)sideroblastic anemia
c)Methemoglobinemia
d)sulfhemoglobinemia","The given clinical scenario of a patient with chronic stable angina, presenting with fatigue and brownish-colored blood is suggestive of methemoglobinemia. For the management of chronic  stable angina, she must be taking nitrates and methemoglobinemia is a rare complication of     nitrate (isosorbide) consumption.
Nitrate ions released during the metabolism of isosorbide oxidize hemoglobin (Fe2+) to the brown methemoglobin (Fe3+), thereby producing methemoglobinemia. The risk of developing clinically    significant methemoglobinemia is higher in patients with coronary ischemia and anemia.
Interestingly, pulse oximetry in methemoglobinemia shows a plateau of 8o% to 85% irrespective   of the arterial oxygen saturation and irrespective of the methemoglobin levels. co-oximeters that    can differentiate methemoglobin from carboxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, and deoxyhemoglobin are thus preferred for the diagnosis of methemoglobinemia.
Treatment of methemoglobinemia associated with isosorbide toxicity involves supportive care, cessation of isosorbide consumption, and reduction of methemoglobin to hemoglobin by
intravenous methylene blue (1–2 mg/kg).
other options:
option A: carboxy-hemoglobinemia occurs due to acute and chronic carbon monoxide
intoxication through occupational exposure and exposure to incompletely burned hydrocarbons. It presents with headache, altered mental status, and other constitutional symptoms.
option B: sideroblastic anemia is a type of anemia that occurs in the presence of normal to high levels of iron. The characteristic ring sideroblasts are seen in the peripheral smear. causes of
sideroblastic anemia include pyridoxine deficiency, lead poisoning, and alcoholism.

b)Tabes dorsalis
c)syringobulbia
d)syringomyelia","The probable diagnosis based on the given clinical scenario and the image showing cavitation around the central canal is syringomyelia.
syringomyelia is a progressive disease of the spinal cord in which there is an enlarging cavity in  the cord. syrinx cavities are acquired cavities of the cord in necrosed areas secondary to trauma, myelitis, and spinal cord tumors. It usually presents in adolescence or early adulthood with
central cord symptoms.
Most patients present with regional dissociated sensory loss of pain and temperature of the upper limbs. Touch and vibration senses are intact. The loss of sensation has a 'cape distribution'



affecting the nape of the neck, shoulders, and upper arms. Eventually, expansion of the cavity may lead to compression of the long tracts. This results in spasticity and weakness of the legs, bowel
and bladder dysfunction, and Horner's syndrome.
MRI is used for the diagnosis. There is no satisfactory treatment for this condition. symptomatic syrinx cavities secondary to trauma or infection, are treated with a decompression and drainage   procedure.
other options:
option A: Brown-sequard syndrome occurs due to the transection of the spinal cord only on one side. This results in ipsilateral weakness and loss of joint position and vibration sensation
with contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation.
option B: Tabes dorsalis is a manifestation of neurosyphilis, which occur within a year or up to 1o-35 years after primary infection. It causes demyelination of the dorsal column of the spinal   cord and presents with bladder disturbances, foot drop, impotence, and ataxia. Loss of
position and vibration sense result in a positive Romberg test.
option c: syringobulbia occurs when the syrinx of syringomyelia extends into the medulla. It is  characterized by palatal or vocal cord paralysis, episodic vertigo, tongue weakness with atrophy, and horizontal nystagmus.",,D,
Q55,A patient was treated for peptic ulcer with an H.pylori regimen. which of the following is used to assess the success of treatment?,"a)Endoscopy
b)IgG antibody study
c)urea breath test
d)urease test of biopsy","The success of treatment after H.pylori can be assessed by the urea breath test.
peptic ulcer disease is most likely caused by Helicobacter pylori. H. pylori is a gram-negative
motile bacillus. It has a unique feature of producing urease which is helpful in diagnosis. The sole source of H. pylori is the human gastric mucus. H.pylori causes chronic superficial gastritis on
long-term colonization. only a few people develop peptic ulceration, gastric adenocarcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas.
Diagnosis can be made by tests based on endoscopic biopsy:
• Biopsy urease test, which is quick and simple (option D)
• Histology can give additional information.
• culture can determine antibiotic susceptibility.
Non-invasive tests:
• serology tests (option B: IgG antibody study) are inexpensive and convenient but cannot be used to monitor treatment success.
• 13c urea breath test requires fasting but is useful for follow-up.
• stool antigen test is useful, particularly in children, and is also useful for follow-up.
The urea breath test is used to assess the success of treatment as it is non-invasive and less
expensive than endoscopy. However, because this test is dependent on H. pylori load, use in less than 4 weeks after treatment may yield false-negative results. Endoscopy and a biopsy-based test are also used in follow-up after treatment. The main indication for these invasive tests is to
exclude underlying gastric adenocarcinoma in a case of gastric ulcer.

b)Coarse crackles
c)Dull note on percussion
d)stridor","The above X-ray and symptoms are suggestive of pleural effusion secondary to a lower respiratory tract infection. on examination, dullness to percussion will be observed.
Pleural effusion refers to the pathological accumulation of fluid in the pleural space due to
• excess fluid formation from the interstitial spaces of the lung, parietal pleura, or peritoneal cavity
• decreased fluid removal by the lymphatics
Pleural effusion may present with dyspnea, pleuritic pain, dry cough, and associated symptoms    like fever, weight loss, edema, and ascites depending on the etiology. on examination, there may be tachypnea, dullness on percussion and decreased/absent breath sounds at the base(s).
The etiology of pleural effusion can be of two types:
• Exudative: disruption in pleural fluid formation and drainage because of local factors. Examples include malignancy, infections, and pulmonary embolism.
• Transudative: disruption in pleural fluid formation and drainage due to systemic factors.
Examples include congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome.
option A: Hyperresonance is a sign of pneumothorax or emphysema.
option B: crackles are heard in cases of pulmonary edema or pneumonia.

Q59,serologic findings of a patient with hepatitis are given below.,"a)HDV RNA copies
b)Anti-HBc IgM positivity
c)Anti-HBs IgM positivity
d)Anti-HBc IgG positivity","As anti-HBc IgG antibodies are representative of a chronic hepatitis B infection, their presence may be indicative of an HBV/HDV (hepatitis B/hepatitis D) superinfection.
HDV superinfection occurs when a person who is already chronically infected with HBV acquires   HDV. The infection of HDV on chronic hepatitis B can accelerate the progression to severe disease in all ages. HDV superinfection accelerates progression to cirrhosis almost a decade earlier than     HBV mono-infected persons.
HBV/HDV coinfection occurs when a person simultaneously becomes infected with both HBV and HDV. In acute hepatitis, simultaneous infection with HBV and HDV can lead to mild-to-severe
hepatitis. The signs and symptoms typically appear 3–7 weeks after the initial infection and
include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, pale stools, jaundice (yellow eyes), and even fulminant hepatitis. However, recovery is usually complete.
Diagnosis of HDV infection is by detecting high levels of anti-HDV immunoglobulin G (IgG) and    immunoglobulin M (IgM). It is confirmed by the detection of HDV RNA in serum, and their levels are not helpful in differentiating between acute and chronic infections. There is no specific
treatment for HDV infection. Pegylated interferon alpha may be used (with limited efficacy).

Acid-base disorders can be divided into metabolic and respiratory causes. A disturbance in one
leads to compensatory changes in the other. The best and quickest method to answer this question is to match the given values with the condition without an elaborate calculation.
• Increased pH with increased bicarbonate is metabolic alkalosis. The lungs are trying to
compensate by retaining carbon dioxide via hypoventilation. Hence this is a case of metabolic alkalosis which is undergoing compensation.
• Decreased pH with decreased bicarbonate suggests metabolic acidosis. But PCo2 levels are normal, suggesting no compensatory changes occurring in the lungs. This is uncompensated metabolic acidosis
• The pH is normal but PCo2 is low suggesting respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation. The    kidneys have compensated by increased excretion of bicarbonate turning pH to normal range. As the pH has come to normal, it is a fully compensated respiratory alkalosis
• The pH is normal here, but an increased PCo2 suggests respiratory acidosis due to
hypoventilation. Here bicarbonate is increased suggesting a metabolic compensation. This is a case of fully compensated respiratory acidosis.",,A,

Heart failure is a manifestation of most chronic cardiac conditions such as hypertension, valvular  heart disease, and coronary artery disease. symptoms such as shortness of breath, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (shortness of breath that develops after lying down for 3omin or      longer) point to left heart failure due to pulmonary congestion. In contrast, symptoms such
as pedal edema, weight gain, early satiety, and hepatic congestion, tender hepatomegaly are characteristic of right heart failure.
Raised non-pulsatile JVP is seen in cardiac tamponade. Tamponade results in elevated right atrial pressure and elevated right ventricular pressures. This results in a prominent x descent and a
diminished or absent y descent in the JVP. The resultant JVP is elevated but nonpulsatile in nature due to the persistently raised pressures in the right heart. (statement 1)
