Q3,First-hand knowledge rule is applicable to:,"a)common witness
b)Hand writing expert
c)Doctor
d)Hostile witness","The first-hand knowledge rule is applicable to a common witness who gives evidence about the facts observed or perceived by him.
An expert witness is someone who has been trained or is skilled or has knowledge and experience and is able to draw conclusions from the facts observed by him. Doctors, handwriting/
fingerprints/ firearms experts come under this category.



A hostile witness is a person who is supposed to have some interest or motive for concealing a part of the truth or for giving completely false evidence.",,A,
Q4,"crown Rump Length is 21 cm, length of lower limb is 1o cm, gestational age of the fetus will be:","a)6 to 7 months
b)4 to 5 months
c)7 to 8 months
d)Term","Gestational age of this fetus is 6-7 months.
crown rump length + length of lower limb = crown heel length
Rule of Haase enables the estimation of the age of the fetus in lunar months from its crown-heel length (in cm).
According to the rule,
• Age in months = square root of crown-heel length (when the crown-heel length is 25 cm or less/ first 5 months).
• Age in months = crown-heel length divided by 5 (when the crown-heel length is more than 25 cm/ last 5 months).
Here, crown heel length = crown rump + lower limb length = 31 cm.
Hence, gestational age = 31 / 5 = 6-7 months.",,A,

Q10,All of the following statements are true about the given condition except:,"a)swabs should be taken immediately after moistening with sterile water
b)It is most commonly caused by incisors and canines
c)photograph is taken with two scales at right angle to one another in the vertical plane
d)3D imaging is possible in the given condition","The above image shows a human bite mark. The photograph is taken with two scales at the right angle to one another in the horizontal plane.
Human bites are usually semi-circular or crescentic caused by the front teeth (incisors, canine). swabs of bite marks should be taken immediately using a swab moistened with sterile water. A sample of the control area adjacent to the mark and of the victim's saliva should also be taken   using swabs moistened with sterile water.
3D imaging is done in which the image is measurable with high precision.
A plastic substance such as rubber is laid over the bite mark which produces a permanent negative cast.",2682-1638.PNG,C,
Q11,An 18-year-old girl was brought to the OpD. Genital examination revealed the findings as given below. These findings are indicative of:,"a)True virgin
b)False virgin
c)premenstrual stage
d)Molestation","The given findings are suggestive of a false virgin.
The examination findings of a separated labia majora, a flabby labia minora, and a fourchette tear are indicative of forceful penetration.
Hymen usually gets ruptured with the first act of sexual intercourse. However, in some cases, hymen remains intact in spite of sexual intercourse. It is indicative of a false virgin.",,B,

b)42 hours
c)24 hours
d)7 days","In case of professional misconduct, the patient's records on demand should be provided within 72 hours.

96 hours.",,A,
Q14,"According to Pocso, aggravated sexual assault includes:","a)sexual assault done by police officer
b)Threatening
c)Gang penetrative sexual assault
d)All of the above","sexual assault done by a police officer is an aggravated sexual assault according to pocso (protection of children from sexual offences).
The pocso act defines a child as any person below eighteen years of age. It defines various forms of sexual offenses which include:
• sexual harassment - Threatening
• sexual assault - Any act with sexual intent that involves physical contact without penetration.
• Aggravated sexual assault - similar to sexual assault along with the criteria explained under the term aggravated
• penetrative sexual assault - An act with sexual intent that involves physical penetration of the penis or any object into the vagina, mouth, urethra, or anus.
• Aggravated penetrative sexual assault - similar to penetrative sexual assault along with the criteria explained under the term aggravated
• pornography
The term aggravated is used for those assaults done:
• By a person in a position of trust or authority such as a police officer, security force, relative, doctor
• In the course of communal violence
• on mentally &amp; physically disabled
• Gang sexual assault
• using deadly weapons
• causing grievous hurt
Depending on if there was penetration or not, it can be aggravated sexual assault (if there is no
penetration) or aggravated penetrative sexual assault (if there was penetration). Both are different. The Act prescribes stringent punishment graded as per the gravity of the offence, with a
maximum term of rigorous imprisonment for life and fine.
Note- Gang penetrative sexual assault comes under aggravated penetrative sexual assault and not under aggravated sexual assault. Therefore, option c cannot be correct in this case.",,A,
Q15,Name the type of skull fracture.,"a)Depressed fracture
b)Hinge fracture
c)pond fracture

Q16,Bullet fingerprinting involves:,"a)primary markings
b)secondary markings
c)Both
d)None","Bullet fingerprinting involves both primary and secondary markings.
primary markings are formed when a bullet passes through a barrel and the sides are marked by the rifling of the barrel (which is specific to the make and model of the gun).
Irregularities on the inner surface of barrel itself which are specific for that particular weapon are also seen on the bullet and are called secondary markings.",,C,
Q17,Identify the injury in the image below.,"a)Abrasion
b)Laceration
c)Bruise
d)Imprint","The given image shows an abrasion.
An abrasion is the most superficial of injuries. It does not penetrate the full thickness of the epidermis.
A pure abrasion does not bleed, as blood vessels are confined to the dermis. However, the dermal  papillae are corrugated in nature. Thus, many abrasions enter the dermis and bleeding commonly occurs.",2684-1640.PNG,A,
Q18,what is the cause of death in smoke inhalation?,"a)Histotoxic hypoxia
b)Ischemic hypoxia
c)Anemic hypoxia
d)All of the above","victims of smoke inhalation are affected by carbon monoxide poisoning. In carbon monoxide poisoning, the cause of death is anemic hypoxia.
carbon monoxide has a higher affinity to hemoglobin compared to oxygen and hence the amount of hemoglobin available for oxygen transport is markedly reduced. It displaces oxygen from its
combination with hemoglobin and forms a relatively stable compound known as
carboxyhemoglobin. It thus reduces the oxygen content of the blood, and hence, that of the tissues. It acts as a chemical asphyxiant and produces death due to anemic anoxia.
It is important to note that in the case of anemic hypoxia, o2 content is low but dissolved o2 is within normal limits so it does not stimulate peripheral chemoreceptors.
Note: carbon monoxide poisoning causes both anemic (due to co-Hb) and histotoxic (due to inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase) hypoxia. But the main cause of death is due to anemic     hypoxia.
option A - Histotoxic hypoxia- The most common example is cyanide poisoning. cyanide inhibits  important enzymes in the oxidative phosphorylation process, which is essential to the survival of   our cells. Additional oxygen supplementation will not be able to overcome this inhibition, so it will have limited benefit. Hyperbaric oxygen may be helpful to some extent.
option B - Stagnant hypoxia refers to ischemic hypoxia that results from inadequate circulation   due to conditions such as heart failure and hypoxia in the setting of shock. In such conditions,    administering intravenous fluids can improve the patient's condition because it is the circulation that is affected. If the shock is prolonged it can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS), which can be treated with positive pressure ventilation and not simply by increasing oxygen administration.",,C,
Q19,paradoxical undressing is seen in:,"a)Heat stress
b)voyeurism
c)Hypothermia
d)LSD overdose","The phenomenon of paradoxical undressing is seen in hypothermia victims.
Its occurrence is attributed to a paradoxical feeling of heat and may lead to an erroneous assumption of a sexual offense.
Fatal hypothermia-induced stupor, loss of powers of judgment, disorientation, and increasing incapacitation are associated with this phenomenon.",,C,
