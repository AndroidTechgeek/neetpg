"Q1","The image given below shows neuromuscular monitoring of the patient after anesthesia. what is the most commonly used nerve for monitoring?","a)ulnar nerve
b)Median nerve
c)Radial nerve
d)Metacarpal nerve","The following image shows neuromuscular monitoring and the most commonly used nerve for monitoring is the ulnar nerve.
The mechanosensor with electrodes is placed over the region of the ulnar nerve. This assesses the contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle to monitor neuromuscular activity.
Monitoring of neuromuscular blockade is required to monitor the blockade
intraoperatively, ensure its complete reversal postoperatively, and prevent residual blockade. To   monitor the neuromuscular function, a peripheral motor nerve is supramaximally stimulated and



the response of the muscle is assessed.
The most commonly assessed nerve-muscle unit is the ulnar nerve-adductor pollicis muscle. This   is because it is easily accessible, has the lowest risk of direct muscle stimulation, and the response can be evaluated visually, by tactile methods, or by objective methods. To stimulate the ulnar
nerve, the electrodes are best applied to the volar aspect of the wrist.
other nerve-muscle units that can be assessed include:
• Posterior tibial nerve- flexor hallucis brevis muscle
• Facial nerve- orbicularis oculi muscle
• Facial nerve- corrugator supercilii muscle
Many methods can be used for objective monitoring of neuromuscular function:
• Mechanomyography (MMG)
• Electromyography (EMG)
• Acceleration of the muscle response (AMG)
• Kinemyography (KMG)
• Cuff pressure modality (CPM)
• Compressomyography (CMG)
• Phonomyography (PMG)","","A",""
"Q2","Identify the mask in the image used for patients with COVID-19 infection.","a)venturi mask
b)Hudson mask
c)Nebuliser
d)Non-rebreathing mask","The mask in the image is a non-rebreathing mask (NRBM). It can be used for patients with CoVID-19 infection.
A NRBM has a reservoir bag attached to the mask in order to provide additional reservoir volume. In addition, there is a valve attached, which provides a unidirectional flow of gases. Flutter valves  on the side ports prevent room air entrainment, while a valve incorporated between the mask and the reservoir bag prevents the entry of the exhaled gases.
NRBM can provide the highest Fio2 of o.9 to 1.o. without intubation at the fresh gas flow of 12-15 L/min. They are used for preoxygenation before intubation and post-extubation in covid patients.  other options:
option A: The venturi mask is a high-flow, fixed-performance device that delivers a specific
oxygen concentration to the patient. It is a color-coded device that connects to the oxygen tubing distally and has a nozzle connecting to a mask proximally. oxygen flows through a central
constriction inside the device. Room air enters through surrounding apertures which dilutes the oxygen to the required concentration. The venturi mask is based on Bernoulli's principle.





option B: Hudson mask is a simple face mask that delivers oxygen without forming a tight seal against the patient's face. There are holes on either side of Hudson's mask. This provides air
entrainment, meeting the peak inspiratory flow and venting out the expired gases.


option C: A nebulizer is used to deliver drugs to the breathing system. It generates an aerosol, producing droplets of varying sizes. It is shown below.","","D",""
