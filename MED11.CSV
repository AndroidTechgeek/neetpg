Q1,A patient with diabetes mellitus for the past 5 years presents with vomiting and abdominal    pain. She is non-compliant with medication and appears dehydrated. Investigations revealed a blood sugar value of 5oo mg/dL and the presence of ketone bodies. what is the next best     step in management?,"a)Intravenous fluids with long acting insulin
b)Intravenous fluids
c)Intravenous insulin
d)Intravenous fluids with regular insulin","The clinical vignette points to a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) for which the next best step in management would be intravenous fluids with regular insulin.
DKA is a complication of diabetes mellitus that arises due to relative or absolute insulin
deficiency, seen more commonly in patients with diabetes mellitus type 1. clinical features include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and tachycardia. Hyperglycemia leads to volume depletion and subsequent hypotension. Kussmaul respiration and fruity odor on the breath are characteristic of  the condition.
Investigation shows elevated glucose levels (25o-6oo mg/dL), ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap.
patients with DKA are also at an increased risk of developing rhinocerebral mucormycosis. coma and cerebral edema are extremely serious complications that can arise.
once the diagnosis is confirmed intravenous fluids should be given along with a bolus of
short-acting regular insulin. Then, intravenous administration of o.1 units/kg/hour of regular insulin is administered until acidosis resolves and the patient is stable.
Insulin treatment and resolution of acidosis can lead to potassium store depletion in DKA but it might be normal or slightly elevated at presentation. This is secondary to acidosis and volume
depletion. If the initial potassium level is &lt;3.3 meq/L, insulin should not be administered till it is corrected.
other options:
option A: Long-acting insulin is started only when the patient resumes eating.
option B: Intravenous insulin (bolus) is one of the initial steps along with intravenous fluids.



option C: Intravenous fluids are given as the first step in management. A bolus of intravenous insulin is also required.",,D,
Q2,"The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimen of a patient is shown below along with the
microscopy. The report shows mononuclear cytosis, elevated proteins, and low sugars. which of the following is the likely etiology?","a)Tuberculous meningitis
b)Aseptic meningitis
c)Bacterial meningitis
d)Chemical meningitis","The given clinical scenario along with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample with cobweb-like clot and slide showing lymphocytic predominance points to a diagnosis of tubercular meningitis.
Tuberculous meningitis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is caused by the formation of
tubercles in the brain parenchyma. This happens during the hematogenous spread of the bacilli during primary infection. It can also be due to the rupture of a subependymal tubercle into the  subarachnoid space.
Tuberculous meningitis presents as a subacute infection and has a longer course than bacterial meningitis. ocular nerve palsy is a common association as there is marked meningeal
involvement at the base of the brain. The patient can also develop hydrocephalus.
The CSF sample shows a pellicle or cobweb-like clots. Acid-fast bacilli can be best isolated from
these. There is usually lymphocytic leukocytosis, low glucose concentration, and elevated proteins. CSF culture remains the gold standard for diagnosis.
The clinical triad of fever, headache, and nuchal rigidity is common to all types of meningitis.
Nuchal rigidity is the resistance of the neck to passive flexion and is pathognomonic of meningeal irritation. kernig's and Brudzinski's signs are other features of meningeal irritation. Raised
intracranial pressure (ICP) is a complication that presents as papilledema, disorientation, or dilated poorly reactive pupils.
other options:
option B - Aseptic meningitis is commonly caused by enteroviruses such as coxsackieviruses, and  varicella-zoster virus. It is more benign and usually self-limiting compared to pyogenic meningitis. Gram's staining of the CSF sample shows lymphocytosis but not the organism.
option C - Bacterial meningitis is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and
Neisseria meningitidis. Blood culture can be used for diagnosis. CSF findings are described in the pearl below. Antibiotic prophylaxis is provided to the close contacts of persons with confirmed
meningococcal disease.
option D - Chemical meningitis is a common cause of chronic meningitis. It can arise due to the    rupture of tumor contents from a cystic glioma, dermoid cyst, or craniopharyngioma into the CSF.",4422-2788.PNG,A,
Q3,A patient diagnosed to be retro-positive was started on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). which of the following can be used to monitor treatment efficacy?,"a)CD4+ T cell count
b)viral load
c)p24 antigen
d)viral serotype","The viral load can be assessed in a retro-positive patient started on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to monitor treatment efficacy.
HAART or combination antiretroviral therapy is the mainstay in the management of retro positive patients. It is initiated soon after diagnosis except in cases of cryptococcal or tuberculous
meningitis.



After initiation of therapy, a ten-fold reduction in plasma human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA levels in 1-2 months can be expected. within six months, a slower decline to &lt;5o
copies/mL is anticipated. During the first month of therapy, a rise in CD4+ T cell count is also predicted. out of these two parameters, viral load is the better choice to monitor treatment
efficacy as it is more cost-effective.
plasma HIV RNA levels signify the rate of CD4+ T-cell destruction and the magnitude of HIV
replication. It should be monitored within 2-4 weeks of initiation of therapy and after any change in the treatment regimen. It should be repeated every 4-8 weeks till the RNA levels drop to
&lt;2oo copies/mL and then every 3-6 months subsequently.
The indications for change in the treatment regimen are:
• &lt; 1o-fold drop in HIV RNA levels within 4 weeks of initiation
• ≥ 3-fold increase from the nadir of plasma HIV RNA level not attributable to other causes
• persistent decline in CD4+ T-cell counts
• Adverse effects
• Clinical deterioration
other options:
option C: p24 antigen is a core protein present in the capsid of the virus.
option D: Viral serotype does not play a role in monitoring treatment efficacy. Most cases of HIV are due to HIV-1. HIV-2, another human immunodeficiency virus can also cause disease in
humans.",,B,
Q4,"A female patient presents to you with a unilateral headache. It is associated with nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. what is the drug of choice for acute management?","a)Flunarizine
b)sumatriptan
c)propranolol
d)Topiramate","The clinical vignette is suggestive of an acute attack of migraine and the drug of choice for acute management is sumatriptan.
Migraine is the second most common cause of headaches and is seen more commonly in women. It presents as an episodic headache associated with nausea, vomiting, photosensitivity, and
sensitivity to sound (phonophobia). Common triggers include bright lights, sounds, and hunger. The release of vasoactive peptides such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRp) by the
trigeminal nucleus cells is the theory used to explain the pathogenesis of the condition. The neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine also play a part.
Triptans are 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor agonists and they act by arresting the nociceptive nerve signaling in the trigeminovascular system. In addition, they cause cranial vasoconstriction.
Cardiac side effects such as transient myocardial ischemia, coronary artery vasospasm, and
myocardial infarction can occur in patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease. other side effects include sweating, nausea, and serotonin syndrome when used in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).
Ergotamine, an ergot alkaloid are serotonin receptor agonists which can be used to treat an acute attack. They produce long-lasting vasoconstriction and can result in gangrene of fingers and toes  (ergotism). These drugs are contraindicated in sepsis, ischemic heart disease, and peripheral



vascular disease.
Migraine can broadly be classified into:
• Migraine with aura
• Migraine without aura
• chronic migraine
The migraine disability assessment score (MIDAS) can be used to assess the severity of the
condition. Avoidance of recognized triggers is helpful to avoid symptoms. The various drugs used  to treat an acute attack of migraine are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), triptans, gepants (rimegepant), ditans (lasmiditan), and dopamine receptor antagonists (domperidone).
In patients with ≥4 attacks in a month, prophylactic medications can be used. The various FDA-approved drugs include propranolol, timolol, flunarizine, and topiramate.
other options:
option A - Flunarizine is a calcium channel blocker that can be used in migraine prophylaxis. Side effects include weight gain, depression, and parkinsonism.
option c - propranolol is a non-selective β-receptor antagonist that can be used to treat
hypertension, arrhythmias, and migraine prophylaxis. It is contraindicated in patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copD) as it can cause bronchoconstriction. Side effects include fatigue, depression, and insomnia.
option D - Topiramate is an FDA-approved drug for generalized tonic-clonic seizures,
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and for migraine prophylaxis in adults. Adverse effects include somnolence, weight loss, and nervousness.",,B,
Q5,"A hypertensive patient who is non-compliant with medication presents to you with sudden  onset breathlessness. A chest X-ray was done, which is shown below. How will you manage this patient?","a)Intravenous salbutamol
b)Intravenous nitroglycerine
c)Nebulization with salbutamol
d)oxygen and antibiotics","The clinical vignette along with the X-ray given points to a diagnosis of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. It can be managed by the administration of intravenous nitroglycerin.
Acute severe hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, or exacerbation of chronic heart failure are some of the common causes of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. It can be precipitated by the  discontinuation of medications (non-compliant patient), excessive salt intake, or
tachyarrhythmias.
It presents with severe dyspnea, pink frothy sputum production, diaphoresis, and cyanosis.
Auscultation reveals rales and rhonchi in all lung fields. chest X-ray shows increased interstitial   markings, vascular redistribution, and alveolar edema in a butterfly pattern. cardiomegaly might be seen in cases of chronic heart failure.
Management of pulmonary edema includes the use of diuretics, nitrates, and morphine to
decrease the preload. Nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate have a rapid onset of action and can be given sublingually. If there is persistence of pulmonary edema and no hypotension, it can be   administered intravenously.
oxygen therapy to maintain a saturation &gt;92% is recommended. positive-pressure ventilation through a face mask or endotracheal intubation is required if saturation is not maintained even



with supplemental oxygen. A sitting position with legs hanging by the side of the bed can be used to reduce venous return in patients without hypotension.
Non-cardiac causes of pulmonary edema are high altitude, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Heart failure is a manifestation of most chronic cardiac conditions such as hypertension, valvular  heart disease, and coronary artery disease. symptoms such as shortness of breath, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea point to left heart failure due to pulmonary congestion. In
contrast, symptoms such as pedal edema, weight gain, early satiety, and hepatic congestion are characteristic of right heart failure.
other options:
options A and C -  salbutamol is a short-acting β2-agonist that is used to treat acute severe
asthma. salbutamol nebulization is used to treat hyperkalemia. side effects include tachycardia, tremors, hypokalemia, and raised glucose levels.
option D - oxygen supplementation is recommended for pulmonary edema but antibiotics have no role in cardiogenic pulmonary edema.",4424-2789.PNG,B,
Q6,"A patient on anti-depressants presented to you with hypotension. An ECG was done, which showed wide QRS complexes and right axis deviation. How will you manage this patient?","a)Antiarrhythmics
b)Intravenous sodium bicarbonate
c)propranolol
d)phenytoin","The given clinical scenario along the ECG changes described suggests a diagnosis of tricyclic antidepressant toxicity. This can be managed with intravenous sodium bicarbonate.
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are used in the treatment of psychotic depression, insomnia, and several pain conditions. Their mechanism of action is inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin  reuptake. They have a quinidine-like sodium channel blockade effect on cardiac conduction.
Hence, they cause QT prolongation. other cardiotoxic effects include atrioventricular (AV) block and hypotension. Rightward-axis deviation is also an associated finding.
TCA toxicity can result in ventricular tachyarrhythmias, status epilepticus, hyperthermia, and coma. It can also result in anticholinergic syndrome due to muscarinic receptor antagonism.
symptoms include dilated pupils, high temperature, dry mouth, and myoclonic movements. It is managed with intravenous sodium bicarbonate bolus (5o-1oo mEq). This helps in the reversal of sodium channel blockade. Gastric lavage and administration of activated charcoal can be carried out in cases of recent ingestion.
other side effects of TCAs include urinary retention, tachycardia, and postural hypotension. ECG changes such as T wave inversion or suppression are also common.
In some cases, it can result in polymorphic ventricular tachycardias with QT prolongation known
as torsades de pointes. Recurrent episodes can be treated with intravenous magnesium sulfate. other options:
option A: Class IA, IC, and III antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated as they potentiate the action of TCAs.
option B: propranolol is a class II antiarrhythmic that can cause wide QRs complexes. It is used for rate control in atrial fibrillation, angina, and hypertension.



option D: phenytoin is an antiepileptic used for the treatment of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and focal seizures. It inactivates sodium channels and stabilizes neuronal membranes. It can
displace TCAs from their protein binding sites which can result in transient overdose symptoms.",,B,
Q7,"A patient presents to you with fever, night sweats, ptosis, and bilateral facial nerve palsy. Investigations showed leukocytosis and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. which of the
following is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Sarcoidosis
b)Tuberculosis
c)Lymphoma
d)Hypersensitive pneumonitis","The given clinical vignette points to a diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
sarcoidosis is a granulomatous inflammatory condition with multisystem involvement. The most common organs affected are the lungs, liver, eye, and skin. The most widely accepted etiological   hypothesis is an inflammatory response to an infectious or non-infectious trigger in a susceptible host.
There are two syndromes that are associated with the condition.
• Lofgren's syndrome is characterized by erythema nodosum and hilar adenopathy. periarticular arthritis can also be seen.
• Mikulicz syndrome is bilateral involvement of parotid, submaxillary, and sublingual glands.
The most common presenting features are cough, dyspnea, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The eyes can be involved in the form of anterior uveitis, photophobia, dry eyes, and blurred
vision. Neurological involvement in the form of myelopathy, basilar meningitis, and facial nerve paralysis. skin involvement can be seen as maculopapular lesions, keloid formation, ad
subcutaneous nodules. Lupus pernio refers to the skin involvement of the bridge of the nose, periocular region, and cheeks and points to a chronic state.


Histopathological examination reveals non-necrotizing granulomas made of macrophages and
giant cells. Calcium and protein concretions known as schaumann bodies and stellate inclusions called asteroid bodies may be seen within the giant cells.






chest X-ray is preferred to stage lung involvement as follows.





CT features include peribronchial thickening and reticular nodular changes. Glucocorticoids are the drug of choice for management.
other options:
option B - Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic granulomatous systemic disease. The underlying
pathophysiology is type IV hypersensitivity reaction. It can present as pulmonary or
extrapulmonary TB. symptoms include fever, night sweats, weight loss, cough, and hemoptysis. Histopathological examination reveals caseating tubercles with multinucleated giant cells and     epitheloid cells.
option C - Lymphomas are broadly classified into Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and
Hodgkin's lymphoma. symptoms include fever, weight loss, night sweats, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly.
option D - Hypersensitivity pneumonitis arises due to inhalation of antigenic triggers which result in an inflammatory response. symptoms include fever, chills, malaise, and dyspnea. Cough,
weight loss, and fatigue can be seen in chronic cases.",,A,4436-2793.PNG;4437-2795.PNG;4437-2794.PNG;4438-2796.PNG
Q8,"A 35-year-old female patient presents to you with fever, breathlessness, and cough with
expectoration. A CT scan was done which is shown below. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Consolidation with air bronchogram
b)Mediastinal mass
c)pleural effusion
d)Diaphragmatic hernia","The given history and the CT scan image are highly suggestive of pneumonia in
which, consolidation with an air bronchogram can be seen.
A patient presenting with fever, breathlessness, and cough with expectoration is most likely
suffering from pneumonia. other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue,
headache, myalgias, arthralgias, etc. The CT image shows a sharply demarcated homogenous
consolidation that crosses segmental boundaries and involves only a single lobe. It is suggestive of lobar pneumonia.
In lobar pneumonia, the infection develops within the distal airspaces. It spreads via the collateral air drift and produces homogenous opacification of complete or partial lung segments. The
airways remain patent as they are not primarily involved. patent bronchi may be seen within the



area of consolidation called air bronchograms. Total resolution of the opacification occurs within 4-6 weeks.
The most common organism implicated in community-acquired adult bacterial pneumonia is streptococcus pneumoniae. some of the predisposing factors include:
• Chronic illness
• splenectomy
• Alcoholism
• sickle cell disease other options:
option B: A mediastinal mass can be in one of the three mediastinal compartments namely
the anterior, middle, or posterior compartment. CT scan is the only imaging modality that should be done for the evaluation in most instances. Barium studies are indicated in patients with
posterior mediastinal masses. Given below is a CT image of a large mass in the left anterior mediastinum, most likely a thymoma.


option C: pleural effusion is the accumulation of fluid within the pleural space. It can be either     transudative (seen in cardiac failure) or exudative (seen in malignancies, infections, pulmonary     embolism, etc.). on a CT image, pleural effusion appears as a dependent sickle-shaped opacity of low attenuation. The image below shows a CT image of right-sided pleural effusion.





option D: Diaphragmatic hernia occurs due to intrathoracic movement of the abdominal contents through a diaphragmatic defect. The types include:
• Bochdalek hernia (posterior): Most common type. Herniation occurs through the pleuroperitoneal foramen.
• Morgagni hernia (anterior): Herniation occurs through the foramen of Morgagni. Given below is a CT image showing Bochdalek hernia.",4425-2790.PNG,A,4439-2797.PNG;4440-2799.PNG;4440-2798.PNG
Q9,A 25-year-old patient is undergoing tooth extraction for dental caries. which of the following does not require prophylaxis against infective endocarditis?,"a)prior history of endocarditis
b)Atrial septal defect
c)unrepaired cyanotic heart disease
d)prosthetic heart valves","Atrial septal defect is not considered a high-risk condition that warrants prophylaxis against infective endocarditis.



Bacterial or fungal infection of the valvular or endocardial surface of the heart is known as
infective endocarditis. Large friable vegetations on the heart valves composed of fibrin,
inflammatory cells, and organisms are characteristic of the condition. predisposing conditions
include mitral valve prolapse, ventricular septal defect, rheumatic heart disease, intravenous drug use, and prosthetic valves.
prophylaxis against infective endocarditis is recommended during certain dental procedures and respiratory tract procedures. In patients not allergic to penicillin, 2g of amoxicillin can be given   orally one hour before the procedure. Another option is to administer 2g of ampicillin
intravenously or intramuscularly 3o minutes before the procedure. Though prophylaxis is not advised, it is recommended that skin and genitourinary tract infections be treated before
undergoing the procedure at these sites.
The most common organisms responsible are staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, and
pneumococci. The oral cavity is the portal for viridans streptococci.  staphylococci are responsible for early prosthetic valve endocarditis. In late prosthetic valve endocarditis, streptococci are
commonly implicated.
clinical features include subungual splinter hemorrhages, osler nodes, Janeway lesions, and Roth spots.
The image below shows osler nodes which are painful raised violaceous lesions commonly affecting the fingers, toes, and feet. It is immunologically mediated.


The image below depicts Roth's spots which are exudative lesions in the retina. This is an immunological phenomenon.





The image given below shows Janeway lesions which are vascular lesions and not immunologically mediated.


symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, arthralgias, and flank pain can also arise due to embolization or immunologically mediated phenomena.
Antibiotics are the mainstay in management. In certain cases, surgical management is necessary. other options:
options A, B, and C - According to American Heart Association (AHA), prior history of
endocarditis, unrepaired cyanotic heart disease, and prosthetic heart valves are all high-risk cardiac lesions that necessitate antibiotic prophylaxis.",,B,4441-2800.PNG;4442-2802.PNG;4442-2801.PNG
Q10,A patient presents to the emergency department with a history of ingestion of ten tablets of     paracetamol. He has developed oliguria and liver function tests show deranged values. which of the following can be used in the management of this condition?,"a)N-acetylcysteine
b)Dopamine
c)ursodeoxycholic acid
d)Furosemide","The clinical vignette suggests acetaminophen (paracetamol) toxicity, which can be managed with N-acetylcysteine.
Early manifestations (within 4-12 hours) of acetaminophen toxicity include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Later, renal failure and myocardial injury may be seen. Low     bilirubin levels along with raised aminotransferase levels are characteristic of the condition.
Acetaminophen toxicity is an important cause of acute liver failure. Ingestion of ≥25g can be fatal. Cytochrome p45o Cyp2E1 metabolizes acetaminophen to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone-imine
(NApQI). Glutathione is responsible for its detoxification, after which it is excreted in the urine. when glutathione reserves are depleted or large amounts of NApQI are formed, it binds to
hepatocyte macromolecules. This can then lead to hepatocyte necrosis.
Initial management includes gastric lavage and oral charcoal or cholestyramine. It should be
carried out within thirty minutes of ingestion. If they are used, gastric lavage must be done
afterward before using another agent. Acetaminophen blood levels can be estimated from a
nomogram plot. In patients with high acetaminophen levels, intravenous N-acetylcysteine
administration within 8 hours of ingestion is recommended. It helps in the replenishment of
glutathione. It is partially effective even up to 36 hours. Liver transplantation is necessary if signs of hepatic failure continue despite therapy.
other options:
option B: Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is used in severe congestive cardiac failure. It acts on β-1 receptors at a dose of 2-1o mcg/kg/minute.
option C: ursodeoxycholic acid is a bile acid that is the first-line treatment for primary biliary cholangitis. It is useful in cholestatic drug hepatotoxicity, but is not recommended.
option D: Furosemide is a loop diuretic commonly used in pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure. side effects include hyponatremia, hypotension, and ototoxicity.",,A,
Q11,"A female patient with a negative urine pregnancy test presents to you with galactorrhea. An     MRI was done which revealed a large pituitary tumor. If the patient is not willing for surgery, which of the following is the best drug for treatment?","a)Bromocriptine
b)Promethazine
c)octreotide
d)clozapine","The clinical vignette points to a diagnosis of prolactinoma and the best drug for the treatment of the condition is bromocriptine.
prolactinomas are pituitary tumors that can present as microadenomas or macroadenomas.
Tumors &lt;1cm in diameter and no regional invasion are known as microadenomas. It is more commonly seen in women. Tumors &gt;1cm in size are known as macroadenomas. It can be
locally invasive. prolactin levels &gt;2ooμg/L are suggestive of prolactinomas.
women present with features such as amenorrhea, infertility, and galactorrhea. visual field
defects can also be seen. symptoms in males include impotence, infertility, and loss of libido. An MRI is recommended in all patients who present with hyperprolactinemia.
Microadenomas can be managed with regular monitoring of prolactin levels and MRI scans, if
fertility is not a requisite. oral dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine and cabergoline are used for medical management. They are agonists at D2 receptors. side effects include constipation,
nasal stuffiness, and dry mouth. Resistance or intolerance to these drugs requires surgical
debulking. Cases that do not respond to medical or surgical management can be treated with radiotherapy.



other options:
option B: Promethazine is an antihistamine used to treat motion sickness, pruritus, and oculogyric crisis.
option C: octreotide is a somatostatin analog that is used in acromegaly, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome.
option D: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic used in refractory schizophrenia and mania.",,A,
Q12,A patient presents to you with an irregularly irregular pulse of 12o/minute and a pulse deficit of 2o. which of the following would be the jugular venous pressure (JVP) finding?,"a)Absent p wave
b)Absent a wave
c)cannon a wave
d)Raised JVP with normal waveform","The clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and the JVP finding seen would be absent a wave.
Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia. There is rapid and irregular atrial
activation which is transmitted through the atrioventricular node. The conducted ventricular rate is usually rapid and irregularly irregular. It can vary from 11o-16o beats/minute. A pulse deficit is an important clinical finding associated with the condition. This arises due to preload reduction.
symptoms include palpitations, fatigue, presyncope, and dyspnea. An ECG shows the absence of P waves.


In acute atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic instability, electrical or chemical cardioversion is the first step. The latter is done by intravenous administration of class III antiarrhythmic - ibutilide.    In a stable patient, ventricular rate control is the primary aim. This is done by intravenous or oral  administration of beta-blockers. Calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and diltiazem can
also be used.
If the current episode duration is &gt;48 hours, cardioversion can precipitate thromboembolic complications. In such cases, cardioversion should be carried out only after 3 weeks of
anticoagulation. It has to be continued for 4 weeks after cardioversion. Another option is to evaluate the presence of a thrombus in the left atrial appendage. This can be done either by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or high-resolution CT.



If the duration is &lt;48 hours and there are no high-risk factors, cardioversion can be done. The CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system is used to assess stroke risk.
warfarin is recommended in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves who present with atrial fibrillation. In mitral stenosis, thrombi arise frequently from the dilated left atrium. Atrial fibrillation in the absence of mitral stenosis is known as nonvalvular atrial
fibrillation. oral factor xa inhibitors such as apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban can be used in such cases.
other options:
option A: Absent p wave is an ECG finding seen in sinoatrial nodal disease and atrial fibrillation.
option C: Cannon a wave is seen in atrioventricular dissociation and contraction of the right atria against a closed tricuspid valve.
option D: Raised JVP with normal waveform is seen in conditions such as congestive heart failure, right ventricular infarction, and superior vena cava obstruction.",,B,4444-2803.PNG
Q13,"A patient with a history of chronic liver disease presents with abdominal distension, jaundice, and pruritis. Ascitic fluid analysis revealed neutrophil count &gt; 65o per cubic mm. what is   the most likely diagnosis?","a)spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
b)Malignant ascites
c)Tubercular ascites
d)Intestinal obstruction","In the given scenario and image of a patient with abdominal distension, jaundice, pruritus, and neutrophil count &gt;65o per mm3, the likely diagnosis is spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is an acute bacterial infection of the ascitic fluid. It is commonly seen in adults in association with liver cirrhosis. The pathogens involved
are Escherichia coli, streptococci, enterococci, and pneumococci.
In a patient with ascites, SBP presents with fever, and acute abdominal pain. on examination, tachycardia, tachypnea, and signs of peritonitis are seen. Hepatic encephalopathy and
gastrointestinal bleeding may also occur.
Diagnosis is by paracentesis, and an ascitic fluid neutrophil count of &gt;25o/mm3 is suggestive of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Ascitic fluid culture may reveal the pathogenic organisms.
Management is mainly by third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime. Albumin infusion   can be given as it decreases the risk of renal failure and improves patient survival. Early diagnosis and treatment improve the prognosis.
other options:
option B: Malignant ascites occurs as a complication of intrabdominal and extraabdominal
malignancies. Patients can present with increasing abdominal girth, generalized abdominal pain, and shortness of breath. weight loss may be more common. Ascitic fluid analysis reveals a milky or bloody appearance with elevated levels of tumor markers and VEGF (vascular endothelial
growth factor). Treatment is by paracentesis and peritoneovenous shunt.
option C: Ascites are often seen in patients with tubercular peritonitis. Multiple tubercles are seen on the peritoneum. Ascitic fluid analysis reveals a straw-colored fluid with a white blood cell count &gt;5oo/mm3. Laparoscopy and peritoneal biopsy may be helpful in diagnosis. Management is by  supportive and anti-tubercular therapy.
option D: Intestinal obstruction can present as pain, abdominal distension, vomiting, and
absolute constipation. Abdominal radiographs taken in a supine position are useful in diagnosis.



Abdominal radiograph in erect posture shows fluid levels. Management is mainly by insertion of a nasogastric tube, replacement of fluid and electrolytes, and surgery.",4427-2791.PNG,A,
Q14,Laboratory investigations of a patient being evaluated for jaundice show elevated bilirubin  and alkaline phosphatase levels. Levels of the remaining liver enzymes are normal. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)obstructive jaundice
b)Hemolytic jaundice
c)Hepatic jaundice
d)prehepatic jaundice","The given laboratory reports showing elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin points to a likely diagnosis of obstructive jaundice.
obstructive jaundice arises due to an obstruction in the biliary outflow due to choledocholithiasis, cholelithiasis, biliary strictures, etc. The patient presents with jaundice, right upper quadrant
pain, pruritus, dark urine, and light-colored stools. The symptoms can be intermittent in cases of periampullary carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma.
Elevated conjugated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are characteristic of the
condition. An associated rise in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels confirms the hepatic origin of ALP.
An ultrasound is done initially in suspected cases of obstructive jaundice. A CT or magnetic  resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is recommended next. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is considered the gold standard for choledocholithiasis.
Jaundice arises due to the deposition of bilirubin in the body tissues. Bilirubin is a breakdown
product of heme that circulates in the blood in the unconjugated/ indirect form. In the
hepatocytes, it is conjugated with glucuronic acid to form conjugated/ direct bilirubin. Direct and indirect bilirubin can be assessed using van den Bergh reaction.
Jaundice is broadly classified into:
• Pre-hepatic jaundice
• Hepatic jaundice
• Posthepatic jaundice
other options:
options B and D: Hemolytic jaundice is one of the common causes of prehepatic jaundice. These include sickle cell anemia, spherocytosis, and thalassemia. Inherited enzyme disorders, such as    Gilbert's syndrome, and Crigler-Najjar types I and II, are other causes. In these cases, there is an isolated elevation of unconjugated bilirubin.
option C: Hepatic jaundice shows an elevation of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alaline
transaminase (ALT) out of proportion to ALP. An increased bilirubin level is also seen. Common causes include viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and autoimmune hepatitis. An AST/ALT
ratio ≥ 2 is highly suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis.",,A,
Q15,"A woman presents to you with fever, arthralgia, ulcers, fatigue for the past six months, and new-onset hematuria. urine examination reveals RBC casts and proteinuria. what is the
likely diagnosis?","a)Acute interstitial nephritis
b)poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis
c)Lupus nephritis
d)IgA nephropathy","The above clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of lupus nephritis.



Lupus nephritis is a common complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (sLE). It results from immune complex deposition containing DNA and anti-DNA. Clinical features include proteinuria, hematuria, and hypertension. The disease is divided into 6 classes based on the severity. patients  with class V disease are at an increased risk of thrombotic complications. Lupus nephritis can
result in end-stage disease warranting dialysis or transplantation.
sLE is an autoimmune condition more commonly seen in women. Antinuclear antibodies,
anti-dsDNA, and anti-sm are the autoantibodies implicated. symptoms include maculopapular
butterfly rash, photosensitivity, oral or nasal ulcers, fever, and intermittent polyarthritis. pleuritis and pericarditis can also be associated. systemic glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, or
mycophenolate mofetil are used for management. Due to the possible teratogenic effects of these drugs, hydroxychloroquine is the mainstay in pregnancy.
other options:
option A - Acute interstitial nephritis is a type of acute kidney injury. It is marked by oliguria and
raised creatinine. Various causes of interstitial injury include the use of non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NsAIDs), pyelonephritis, leukemia, and sepsis. White blood cell (WBC) casts and granular casts may be seen.
option B - post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis usually affects male children between the age of  2-14. skin or pharyngeal infection with M types of the organism is implicated. symptoms include   hematuria, pyuria, and hypertension. Flank pain and headache are also associated symptoms. Red blood cell (RBC) casts are seen in the urine.
option D - IgA nephropathy arises due to mesangial IgA deposition. It is characterized by
recurrent macroscopic hematuria after an upper respiratory infection associated with proteinuria. Mesangial proliferation is a distinctive feature. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors    and steroids can be used for management.",,C,
Q16,"An 11-year-old child with a history of streptococcal pharyngitis presents you with fever and arthralgia. There is no past history of rheumatic heart disease or features of carditis or
valvular disease. How often is 6,oo,ooo IU of benzathine penicillin recommended for prophylaxis of rheumatic heart disease?","a)Immediately
b)Thrice weekly lifelong
c)once in three weeks for 5 years or till the age of 18, whichever is longer
d)once in three weeks for 1o years or till the age of 25, whichever is longer","The given clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever (ARF). The secondary      prophylaxis after an episode for a patient weighing &lt;27 kilograms is 6,oo,ooo IU of benzathine penicillin injection once every three weeks for 5 years or till the age of 18, whichever is longer.
ARF is an autoimmune disease that develops in response to group A streptococcal infection. It is commonly seen in children between the age of 5-14 years. An upper respiratory tract infection
with some M serotypes of the organism is the trigger. The concept of molecular mimicry is used to explain the pathogenesis of the condition.
since one attack of ARF increases the risk for further episodes and development of RHD,
secondary prophylaxis is recommended by the American heart association (AHA) as follows:
• Rheumatic fever without carditis: For 5 years after the last attack or till 18/21 years of age (whichever is longer).
• Rheumatic fever with carditis but no residual valvular disease: For 1o years after the last attack or till 21/25 years of age (whichever is longer).
• Rheumatic fever with persistent valvular disease, evident clinically or on echocardiography: For 1o years after the last attack or till the age of 4o (whichever is longer). sometimes lifelong



prophylaxis can be given.
symptoms usually present after a latent period of about three weeks. Indolent carditis and chorea are the exceptions that can present even six months later. Migratory asymmetric
polyarthritis which affects large joints and high-grade fever are common features. cutaneous
manifestations include erythema marginatum and subcutaneous nodules. sydenham's chorea is commonly found in females and frequently affects the head and upper limbs. Acute rheumatic   carditis can be seen as involvement of the endocardium, myocardium, or pericardium.
Histopathological examination shows Aschoff bodies and activated macrophages called Anitschkow cells.
The image below shows Aschoff bodies.


In chronic rheumatic heart disease, there is a leaflet and tendinous cord thickening along with
commissural fusion and shortening of the mitral valve. ultimately the valve can undergo stenotic changes giving it a fish-mouth appearance as shown below.




The modified Jones criteria is used for diagnosis. Management of ARF is mainly symptomatic by the use of antibiotics and NSAIDs.",,C,4437-2795-1.png;4411-2783.PNG
Q17,A man on diuretics presents with weakness. An ECG was done which showed flat T waves and prominent U waves. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Hypokalemia
b)Hyperkalemia
c)Hypomagnesemia
d)Hypernatremia","Based on the clinical scenario, the most likely diagnosis is hypokalemia.
Hypokalemia is defined as a plasma concentration of K+ &lt;3.5 meq/L. Common causes include     metabolic alkalosis, diarrhea, use of diuretics, starvation, and β2-agonists. It can also be seen after massive blood transfusion and in cystic fibrosis. It affects the cardiac, skeletal, and intestinal cells. It can lead to arrhythmias and intestinal ileus and increases the risk for rhabdomyolysis.
ECG changes include ST depression, prominent U Waves, and prolonged repolarization. Pseudo P pulmonale Waves can also be seen.





oral potassium chloride is the mainstay in management. In patients unable to use the enteral route, intravenous potassium chloride can be given in saline.
other options:
option B: Hyperkalemia is a plasma K+ concentration &gt;5.5 meq/L.Common causes include
acidosis, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and β2-antagonists. It can be seen as a manifestation of chronic kidney disease, and after a massive blood transfusion. It leads   to increased aldosterone secretion.  ECG changes include tall T waves, prolonged PR intervals,
and small P waves. In severe cases, wide QRS complexes which progress to an undulating pattern (sine wave) and asystole can be seen.


option C: Hypomagnesemia can arise due to prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors. It presents as delirium, neuromuscular dysfunction, reduced parathyroid function, and treatment-resistant
hypokalemia. ECG might reveal hypokalemia potentiated by the condition. It has been implicated in ventricular arrhythmias with acute myocardial infarction and torsades de pointes. It can also     enhance digitalis toxicity.
option D: Hypernatremia is defined as plasma Na+ concentration &gt;145 meq/L. Common causes include diarrhea, hyperglycemia, and post obstructive diuresis. Altered mental status and
generalized weakness are the common manifestations. It can also cause neonatal seizures.",,A,4449-2805.PNG;4449-2804.PNG;4450-2806.PNG
Q18,"A male patient presents to the emergency department. The arterial blood gas report is as
follows: pH, 7.2; pCo2, 81mm Hg; and HCo3, 4o meq/L. which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Respiratory alkalosis
b)Metabolic acidosis
c)Respiratory acidosis
d)Metabolic alkalosis","The arterial blood gas values suggest a likely diagnosis of respiratory acidosis.
The various buffering systems present in the body maintain the systemic arterial pH between
7.35-7.45. The most common acid-base disorders are metabolic acidosis or alkalosis and respiratory acidosis or alkalosis.
Normal values in an arterial blood gas are as follows:
• pH: 7.35-7.45




•
paco2: 35-45 mmHg
•
Hco3: 22-26 mEq/L
•
pao2: 75-1oo mmHg
Respiratory changes (changes in pco2) promote a corresponding change in metabolic response  (changes in Hco3-) and vice versa as a compensatory mechanism. In general, pco2 and Hco3- move in the same direction for compensation in metabolic and respiratory acid-base disorders    respectively. A change in the two parameters in opposite directions points to a mixed acid-base   disturbance.
Respiratory acidosis can be secondary to severe pulmonary disease, respiratory muscle fatigue, or ventilatory control abnormalities. It is marked by an increase in paco2 and a decrease in pH. A    compensatory rise of Hco3- can also be seen.
A rapid rise in pco2 (acute hypercapnia) can present with dyspnea, confusion, and psychosis. It can be seen in severe asthma secondary to bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, or inhalational burns.
chronic hypercapnia causes sleep disorders, memory loss, and daytime somnolence. It is commonly seen in end-stage obstructive lung disease.
Acute respiratory acidosis may need tracheal intubation and assisted mechanical ventilation.
Rapid correction of hypercapnia should be avoided as it can trigger cardiac arrhythmias and
seizures. chronic respiratory acidosis is difficult to manage and improvement in lung function is the primary aim.
other options:
option A: Respiratory alkalosis arises due to alveolar hyperventilation and can be due to salicylates, high altitude states, cardiac failure, and anemia.
option B: Metabolic acidosis arises due to an accumulation of endogenous acids. Examples
include lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, and starvation. It can also be seen in renal failure.
option D: Metabolic alkalosis can be seen in Liddle's syndrome, hypertrophic pyloric stenosis,    massive blood transfusion, and cystic fibrosis. It is marked by elevated pH and Hco3- values. A rise in paco2 indicates a compensatory respiratory response.",,C,4452-2807.PNG
Q19,which of the following is not seen in MEN 2B syndrome?,"a)Megacolon
b)parathyroid adenoma
c)Mucosal neuroma
d)Marfanoid habitus","parathyroid adenoma is not seen in multiple endocrine neoplasia 2B (MEN 2B) syndrome.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) describes conditions with tumors involving two or more
endocrine glands. There are four types - MEN 1-4. They have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and can also be sporadic.
MEN type 2 comprises groups of disorders caused by gain-of-function mutations of the RET proto-oncogene at chromosomal locus 1oq11.2. There are three variants:
• MEN 2A, also known as MEN 2 (most common type)
• MEN 2B, also known as MEN 3
• MTC only
MEN 2A is also known as sipple's syndrome. It is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytomas, and parathyroid tumors.
In MEN 2B along with MTC and pheochromocytoma, it is associated with other abnormalities such as mucosal neuromas, marfanoid habitus, medullated corneal nerve fibers, and
megacolon. parathyroid tumors are generally not seen here, in contrast to the MEN 2A type.
MTC presents early and is usually aggressive. MTC is the most common feature, presents as a palpable mass in the neck, and can be associated with pressure symptoms. Ectopic
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secreted by the tumor can cause Cushing's syndrome.
pheochromocytoma is frequently bilateral. palpitations, sweating, and headaches are the features of pheochromocytoma.
Mucosal neuromas can present with bumpy and enlarged lips, tongue, and eyelids. Intestinal
autonomic ganglion dysfunction can lead to megacolon and diverticula. Medullated corneal fibers and delayed puberty can also be seen. Marfanoid habitus marked by tall stature, long limbs,
arachnodactyly, and joint hypermobility is an associated feature.",,B,
Q20,A patient with coronary artery disease presents to you with chest pain and palpitations. The ECG is shown below. which of the following can be used in the management?,"a)oral metoprolol
b)oral amiodarone
c)Intravenous amiodarone
d)Intravenous metoprolol","The clinical scenario along with the ECG points to a diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia.
Intravenous amiodarone (class III antiarrhythmic) can be used in the management of this condition.
The patient here complaining of chest pain, and palpitations and has ECG changes showing wide QRS complex tachycardia with absent p waves is likely to have acute ventricular tachycardia.
Since the patient is stable and has an underlying coronary artery disease the drug of choice is intravenous amiodarone.
ventricular tachycardias can be defined as three or more pre-ventricular contractions at a rate &gt;1oo/minute.
ECG changes include wide QRS complexes, absence of p waves, and ventriculoatrial
dissociation. It can be broadly classified as sustained vT or non-sustained vT. Nonsustained vT has QRS complexes lasting &lt;3o seconds while sustained vT lasts for &gt;3o seconds. In
monomorphic vT, all QRS complexes look the same. polymorphic vT has QRS complexes varying in shape or direction in the same lead.
Most monomorphic vT have an underlying cardiac disease. Symptoms of ventricular tachycardia include palpitations, syncope, and shortness of breath.
In a hemodynamically stable patient, amiodarone, procainamide, and lidocaine can be used to
treat the condition. In the presence of heart disease, intravenous amiodarone is the drug of
choice. In hemodynamically unstable patients, electrical cardioversion is done. Further
management depends on the underlying heart condition and frequency of vT. Frequent episodes warrant the use of antiarrhythmics or catheter ablation.
Torsades de pointes is a type of polymorphic vT occurring with QT prolongation. It can progress  to ventricular fibrillation which is treated with defibrillation. Recurrent episodes can be managed with intravenous magnesium sulfate.
other causes of wide QRS complexes include supraventricular tachycardias with bundle branch block and wolff-parkinson-white syndrome.
other options:
options A and D: Metoprolol is a selective β1-antagonist and a class II antiarrhythmic. It can be used in hypertension, angina, and heart failure. The intravenous form can be used for initial
management in acute myocardial infarction.
option B: oral amiodarone can be used in the chronic treatment of atrial fibrillation, ventricular   tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. It has shown a modest beneficial effect on mortality after acute myocardial infarction.",4429-2792.PNG,C,
Q21,Multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis shows resistance to which of the following drugs?,"a)Isoniazid, rifampicin, and fluoroquinolone
b)Fluoroquinolones
c)Isoniazid and rifampicin
d)Isoniazid, rifampicin, and kanamycin","Muti-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) shows resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin.



MDR-TB poses a serious problem in the treatment ofTB as isoniazid and rifampicin are the most potent first-line drugs.
The treatment of MDR-TB is curated with drugs grouped into different classes by the world health organization (WHO).
• Group A: Levofloxacin, bedaquiline, linezolid
• Group B: Clofazimine, cycloserine
• Group C: Ethambutol, pyrazinamide, delamanid, ethionamide
In patients treated previously or with additional drug resistance, a longer MDR-TB regimen of
18-2o months is recommended. Drugs belonging to group A are preferred along with one drug
from group B whenever possible. A shorter regimen of 6 months including bedaquiline with other drugs can be used in patients not treated before and without extensive disease. In pregnant
women with MRD-TB, drugs such as bedaquiline and delamanid should be avoided.
The nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)/ gene xpert is used to detect rpoB gene
polymorphisms, which are responsible for rifampicin resistance.
The four drugs considered first-line agents in the treatment of TB are isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.
Isoniazid is an antibiotic that works by inhibiting the synthesis of mycolic acid, an essential component of the mycobacterial cell wall. It is a bactericidal drug. It acts as a vitamin B6
antagonist, so oral pyridoxine supplementation is recommended during treatment. side effects include peripheral neuritis, seizures, and ataxia.
Rifampicin is a macrocyclic antibiotic that inhibits RNA synthesis and is bactericidal. It is also used in the prophylaxis of meningococcal infections. side effects include rash, vomiting, and    hepatitis. It is a microsomal enzyme inducer that can result in contraceptive failure.
Ethambutol inhibits the mycobacterial cell wall assembly. side effects include optic neuritis, pruritus, and joint pain.
pyrazinamide is a nicotinamide analogue activated in acidic conditions. side effects include liver injury and hyperuricemia.
Other options: Fluoroquinolones are considered second-line agents used in the treatment for drug-resistant TB. kanamycin, an injectable aminoglycoside is excluded from the new WHO  classification of second-line drugs.",,C,
Q22,"A patient presents to you with fever, jaundice, and malaise. what is the most likely diagnosis based on the serology reports given below?","a)Acute hepatitis B
b)Acute hepatitis C
c)Chronic hepatitis B
d)Chronic hepatitis C","The given clinical scenario along with the serology reports suggest a diagnosis of acute hepatitis B.
Acute hepatitis B presents after an incubation period of 3o-18o days with symptoms such as
anorexia, malaise, and myalgias. A low-grade fever can also be associated. These symptoms can precede jaundice by 1-2 weeks. Mild weight loss and tender hepatomegaly are other features.
The presence of HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), also known as Australia antigen, IgM
anti-HBc antibodies (antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen), and the absence of anti-HBs is  the characteristic picture seen in acute hepatitis B with high infectivity. The absence of anti-HCV



antibodies excludes a diagnosis of hepatitis C.


Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) values are usually elevated along with bilirubin levels. Serological markers vary according to the phase of the disease process as    shown below.
Most cases undergo spontaneous recovery. prophylaxis can be carried out with the use of vaccines containing HbsAg. Anti-HBs titres ≥ 1omIU/mL are protective.
Acute viral hepatitis can be due to due to any of the five agents - hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), and hepatitis E virus
(HEV). Clinical features of all acute viral hepatitis are similar. A patient suspected to have acute hepatitis should be tested for HBsAg, IgM anti-HAV, IgM anti-HBc, and anti-HCV.
other options:
option B: Acute hepatitis C is caused by HCV which is an RNA virus. It is a blood-borne infection. Detection of anti-HCV and HCV RNA is used for diagnosis. HCV-RNA appears before anti-HCV
and persists for the entire duration of the disease.
option C: Chronic hepatitis B is a late complication of acute hepatitis B. persistence of HBeAg for &gt;3 months or HBsAg for &gt;6 months is suggestive of the development of the condition.
Investigations show the presence of HBsAg, IgG anti-HBc, HBeAg, and HBV DNA. Fatigue and intermittent jaundice are the main features. It can progress to cirrhosis or hepatocellular
carcinoma. Hepatitis D superinfection can accelerate this progression.
option D: Chronic hepatitis C is a common complication of acute hepatitis C. It can progress to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma HCV-RNA and anti-HCV can be detected on serology.",,A,4455-2808.PNG
Q23,"A child presents to the emergency department with a history of ingestion of 1o-2o ferrous
sulfate tablets. Arterial blood gas revealed acidosis. which of the following can be used in the management of this condition?","a)Deferoxamine
b)Activated charcoal
c)Dimercaprol
d)penicillamine","The clinical scenario points to iron toxicity, which is managed with deferoxamine (also known as desferrioxamine).



Large amounts of ferrous salts can be fatal in children. Initial symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal bleeding. In severe cases, cyanosis and hyperventilation   due to acidosis can develop. This can sometimes be followed by an asymptomatic phase. Later,
hypoglycemia and hepatic and renal failure can develop. pyloric stenosis and gastric scarring can develop due to its corrosive nature. ultimately, if left untreated, the child can die.
The gastric contents can be used for an iron color test to estimate the iron concentration in
plasma. As iron tablets are radiopaque, an X-ray can be used to assess the number of pills taken. Deferoxamine, an iron chelator has to be administered intramuscularly. side effects include
pruritus, wheals, rash, and anaphylaxis.
Deferiprone and deferasirox are other oral iron chelators used to treat iron overload in thalassemia patients.
other options:
option B: Activated charcoal can be used in the initial management of acetaminophen and opioid overdose. It is used for gastrointestinal decontamination to prevent further absorption of the
poison.
option C: Dimercaprol, also known as BAL (British anti-Lewisite), is used to treat arsenic, mercury poisoning, and wilson's disease.
option D: D-penicillamine (Cuprimine) can be used to treat scleroderma, wilson's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. side effects include nephrotoxicity, hematologic derangements, and a
characteristic rash that involves the neck and axillae—elastosis perforans serpiginosa. It is
associated with membranous glomerulonephritis, drug-induced lupus, and myasthenia gravis.",,A,
