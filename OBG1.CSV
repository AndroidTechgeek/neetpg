Q1,A pregnant lady with PIH was being monitored with bed rest in supine position. which of the following is a complication of the below representation?,"a)Ascending aorta syndrome
b)superior vena caval syndrome
c)Abdominal aorta syndrome
d)supine venacava syndrome","supine vena cava syndrome is the complication of the given representation. The image shows    compression of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus which can sometimes lead to supine hypotension.
During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus compresses the great vessels against the hard spine,
when the patient is in the supine position. of the two vessels, the vena cava is compressed, but the aorta, owing to its structure is relatively resistant.
Normally, the vena cava compression results in opening up collateral circulation by means of    paravertebral and azygous veins but in some cases, when the collateral circulation fails to open up, the venous return of the heart may be seriously curtailed resulting in hypotension,
tachycardia, and syncope and is called supine vena cava syndrome.
The normal blood pressure is quickly restored by turning the patient to the lateral position.",5776-3656.PNG,D,
Q2,which of the following is part of the wHO guidelines for the management of second stage of labor?,"a)Do a routine episiotomy
b)Manual support to perineum to maintain flexion of head
c)Never give warm compress to the perineum
d)Perform labor in lithotomy position","The practice of guarding the perineum during delivery of the fetal head is part of the WHo management guidelines for the second stage of labor.
The fingers of one hand support the perineum, while the second hand applies pressure to the fetal head to control the speed of crowning. The advantage of this is to prevent perineal tears.
The second stage of labor begins with full dilatation of the cervix and ends with the delivery of the fetus.
The main events include the descent of the fetus (bearing down by the mother, uterine contractions), cardinal movements of labor, and delivery of the fetus.
Management of the second stage of labor:
• The most common position used is the dorsal position with the hips flexed, knees flexed and
abduction of the thighs. WHo recommends any position of choice including the upright position.
• WHo recommendations for the prevention of perineal tears include warm compresses to the perineum, perineal massage, guarding the perineum, and modified Ritgen's maneuver.
• Modified Ritgen's maneuver: A sterile towel or pad is held in one hand and placed over the
perineum; the other hand applies gentle downward pressure on the occiput to promote flexion
and controlled delivery of the head (ensuring the smallest diameter of the head passes through the outlet). once the occiput is born–with gentle pressure, the head is extended–forehead, nose, and    mouth are then delivered.
• WHo doesn't recommend fundal pressure and routine episiotomy.
other options:
option A: A liberal or routine episiotomy is discouraged. Episiotomy is indicated in cases of:
• shoulder dystocia
• Breech delivery
• Fetal macrosomia
• operative vaginal deliveries
• persistent occiput posterior positions
option C: Manual techniques, such as massage or application of warm compresses, are
recommended for healthy pregnant women requesting pain relief during labor.
option D: The position that is most comfortable to the mother i.e. upright/squatting position is encouraged. This position gives:
• less discomfort and difficulty in bearing down
• less labor pain
• less perineal/vaginal trauma and wound infections

Q3,Identify the best parameter to assess in case of male infertility,"a)The quantity of sperms
b)The motility of sperms
c)The morphology of sperms
d)The number of sperm","The morphology of sperms is the best parameter to assess male infertility.
characterization of normal sperm morphology shows improved correlation with fertilization rates during IVF cycles.
The criteria requires careful analysis of the following:
• The shape and size of the sperm head,
• The relative size of the acrosome in proportion to the head,
• And characteristics of the tail, including length, coiling, or presence of two tails.
significantly decreased fertilization rates are observed when normal morphology of the sample falls below 4 percent.
Abnormal sperm morphology is termed teratospermia or teratozoospermia. Whereas sperm
concentration and progressive motility have value for distinguishing fertile from infertile men, strict sperm morphology (as determined by an individual having extensive training and
experience) was the one most discriminating value.

Q4,"A 26-year-old woman underwent a workup for primary infertility. on hysterosalpingography, there was a bilateral cornual block. what is the next step in management?","a)Tuboplasty
b)Hysteroscopy and laparoscopy-guided surgery
c)Hydrotubation
d)In-vitro fertilization","In the given clinical scenario, the next step in management will be hysteroscopy and
laparoscopy-guided surgery.
Tubal contractions, particularly cornual spasms, can give an incorrect impression of proximal
fallopian tube obstruction (a false-positive result) on hysterosalpingography. Laparoscopy with
chromotubation is therefore considered to confirm the diagnosis of cornual spasm. Laparoscopy is both diagnostic and therapeutic in this condition.



Hysteroscopy is an operative procedure that provides an endoscopic view of the endometrial cavity and tubal ostia via the cervix, performed in the preovulatory phase. It can
be diagnostic or therapeutic. It is the gold standard investigation for visualizing the uterine cavity and tubal ostia.
contraindications to hysteroscopy are as follows:
• Acute genital tract infection (Eg: genital herpes infection)
• viable intrauterine pregnancy
• During menstruation, the view is obscured, and the infection rate is high.
• Scarred uterus and enlarged uterus of size ≥ 12 weeks are relative contraindications.
• cervical stenosis can cause cervical tears and uterine perforation.
• cardiopulmonary disorder due to increased risk of fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
• known cases of cervical cancer
Laparoscopy is the gold standard for the evaluation of tubal factors in infertility, commonly done in the proliferative phase. It can be diagnostic or therapeutic.
Benefits of laparoscopic evaluation:
• Tubes: For detection of tubal patency, block (site and side), motility, hydrosalpinx change, peritubal adhesions, fimbrial agglutination
• ovaries: PcoS changes, endometriosis, PID, adhesions
• uterus: Anomalies, fibroids
• Peritoneal factors: Adhesions, PID, endometriosis, tuberculosis
• Therapy at the same sitting (as appropriate)

Q5,A 4o-year-old woman comes with a history of postcoital bleeding and a visible mass seen in the cervix per speculum. The next step to be done:,"a)conization
b)cryotherapy
c)Targeted biopsy
d)pap smear","A targeted biopsy is the next line of management in the patient with a visible cervical mass and postcoital bleeding. A pap smear is done when there are symptoms with no identifiable lesion.
other options:
option A: conization is an invasive procedure where the cervix is cut in a cone-shaped manner. It is both diagnostic and therapeutic. It is indicated for diagnosis in women with HSIL or
adenocarcinoma in situ and may be considered under the following conditions:
• The limits of the lesion cannot be visualized with colposcopy.
• ScJ (squamocolumnar junction) is not seen in colposcopy.
• colposcopy is positive for cIN 2/cIN 3.
• Lack of correlation between cytology, biopsy, and colposcopy.
• Suspected micro invasion in cytology, colposcopy, or biopsy.
• colposcopist is unable to rule out invasive cancer.
Hence it is very clear that conization is not indicated for all symptomatic women and it should be done following either a PAP, colposcopy or a biopsy with an abnormal or inconclusive result.
option B: cryotherapy is ideal only for small superficial lesions. It is indicated for biopsy-proven   lesions. cryotherapy is appropriate for cIN 1 which has persisted for more than 24 months and is confined to the ectocervix.
option D: The false negative rate of pap smear in the presence of invasive cancer is 5O% and a
negative pap test should never be relied on in a symptomatic patient, especially one with a visible lesion.
cIN: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, HSIL: High squamous intraepithelial lesion, LSIL: Low squamous intraepithelial lesion",,C,
Q6,"For emergency contraception, a single tab of o.75 mg of LNG was taken, it should be followed by which of the following?","a)single dose of o.75 after 12 hrs
b)Two doses 12 hrs apart
c)Three doses 12 hrs apart
d)None of the above","In this case, the 2nd dose of LNG O.75 mg (levonorgestrel) is taken after 12 hours.
Levonorgestrel can be used in emergency contraception without major side effects. one tablet of LNG O.75 mg should be taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, and another after 12    hours. Alternatively, two tablets can be as a single dose (1.5 mg).
The tablets can be offered up to 12O hours but the efficacy decreases with the longer coital-drug interval.
Advantages of LNG tablets:
• It has no estrogen and its associated side effects.
• It can be offered to hypertensive, cardiac and diabetic women.



• It can be offered to a lactating woman.
• It can be given as late as 12o hours after unprotected intercourse (but efficacy decreases).
• single-dose therapy is an advantage.
contraindications to LNG tablets include liver disease, a history of thrombophlebitis and migraine.
Indications for emergency contraception:
• Unprotected intercourse
• condom rupture
• Missed pill
• Delay in taking progesterone-only pill for &gt;3 hours
• Rape/sexual assault
Drugs used in emergency contraception:
• Mifepristone (RU486) is a progesterone antagonist, which blocks the hormonal action on the     endometrium, causing the sloughing and shedding of decidua, preventing implantation. A single dose of 25-5o mg is effective in pregnancy in 99.1% of cases. It causes delayed menstruation and expensive than LNG.
• Ulipristal is a synthetic progesterone hormone receptor modulator. It binds to progesterone
receptors and prevents/delays ovulation and suppresses endometrium, preventing implantation. A 3o mg tablet should be taken within 5 days. A two per cent pregnancy rate has been reported. side effects are headaches and mood changes.
• centchroman: 2 tablets (6o mg) taken twice in 24 hours, within 24 hours of intercourse can prevent implantation in 99% of women.
• copper T IUcD: inserted within 5 days of unprotected intercourse can prevent implantation of a fertilized ovum. The advantages of copper T IUcD are- it is cheap, has a failure rate of o.1%,
inserted as late as 5 days after unprotected intercourse and remains an ongoing contraceptive method for 3-5 years.
• yuzpe method:  ethinyl estradiol 5o µg + norgestrel o.25 mg. It is given as 2 tab stat and 2 after 12 hours.",,A,
Q7,"A primigravida came to the labor room at 4o weeks + 5 days gestation for induction of labor. on per vaginal examination, the cervix is 1 cm dilated and is 3o% effaced. The vertex is at –1 station and the cervix is soft and posterior. what will be the bishop score for this lady?","a)o

Q8,A woman whose obstetric score is G2 P1 L1 had an LMP of Jan 9th 2o17. calculate the EDD according to Naegele’s rule.,"a)september 19
b)october 19
c)october 16
d)september 16","As per Naegele s rule, the EDD (expected date of delivery) of this woman is october 16, 2o17.
Naegele s rule states that EDD is obtained by adding 7 days and subtracting 3 months from the LMp (the 1st day of the last menstrual period). Another method is adding 9 months and 7
days to LMp. Less than 5% of births follow Naegele's rule.
It is based on a 28-day regular cycle. If the cycle is shorter/longer than 28 days, corrected EDD is calculated as follows:
For a 35-day cycle, add another 7 (35-28=7) days to the calculated EDD to get the corrected EDD.
For a 25-day cycle, subtract 3 (28-25=3) days from the calculated EDD to get the corrected EDD. Naegele s rule cannot be followed in IVF pregnancies. considering the human embryo takes 266    days to develop, EDD is calculated in IVF pregnancies by the following method:
same day as fertilization (day o): EDD = date of transfer + 266 days
3 days after fertilization (day 3): EDD = date of transfer + 263 days
5 days after fertilization (day 5): EDD = date of transfer + 261 days",,C,
Q9,Identify the grip in the image given below:,"a)second pelvic grip
b)Abdominal grip
c)pawlik grip
d)Fundal grip","Leopold's third maneuver (also called the pawlik’s grip) is performed by grasping with the thumb and fingers, the lower portion of the maternal abdomen just above the symphysis pubis. If the
presenting part is not engaged, a movable mass will be felt.
Abdominal palpation- Leopold maneuvers:
In the abdominal examination, the mother is made to lie supine and comfortably positioned with her abdomen barred. Leopold maneuvers can be performed throughout the latter months of
pregnancy and during and between the contractions of labor.
Leopold's maneuvers may be difficult if not impossible to perform and interpret if the patient is obese, if the amnionic fluid volume is excessive, or if the placenta is anteriorly implanted.
with experience, it is possible to estimate the size of the fetus.
• 1st Leopold (fundal grip): identifies which fetal pole (cephalic or podalic) occupies the uterine
fundus. The fetal head is hard and round and is more mobile and ballotable whereas the breech is felt as a large, soft and irregular mass.
• 2nd Leopold (lateral/umbilical grip): palms are placed on either side of the abdomen and gentle, but deep pressure is exerted. The back is felt as a hard and resistant structure. The fetal limbs are felt as numerous, small, irregular parts. By noting whether the back is directed anteriorly,
transversely or posteriorly, the fetal orientation can be determined.
• 3rd Leopold (pawlik's grip): it aids in confirmation of fetal presentation. In transverse lie, pawlik's grip is empty.
• 4th Leopold (pelvic grip): it helps to determine the degree of descent.",5778-3657.PNG,C,5794-3659.PNG
Q10,A primigravida came with 6 cm cervical dilatation and a contraction rate of 3/1o minutes. which stage of labor is she in?,"a)1st stage
b)2nd stage
c)3rd stage
d)4th stage","In this case, cervical dilatation of 6 cm and contraction rate of 3/1o minutes is indicative of first stage of labor.
The first stage of labor is characterized by dilatation and effacement of cervix and can be divided into latent phase and active labor.
• The onset of latent labor is the point at which the mother perceives regular contractions.
• cervical dilatation of ≥6 cm in the presence of uterine contractions can be taken to reliably represent the threshold for active labor.
The second stage of labor begins with complete cervical dilatation and ends with fetal delivery. The third stage of labor is characterized by the delivery of the placenta.
The fourth stage is a stage of observation for at least an hour after the full expulsion of the placenta.",,A,
Q11,Identify the following instrument commonly used in obstetrics.,"a)Mayo scissors
b)curved scissors
c)suture remover
d)Episiotomy scissors","The instrument given in the picture is episiotomy scissors. The angulation in the scissor is to
prevent the extension of pelvic tears into the anal margins and obstetric anal sphincter injuries / complete perineal tears.
complications of episiotomy:
They can be immediate or remote.
Immediate complications include an extension of the incision into the rectum, vulval hematoma, wound dehiscence and injury to anal sphincter.
Remote complications include dyspareunia, chances of perineal lacerations in subsequent labor and scar endometriosis (rare).
Mayo scissors are long and stout scissors. They can be blunt-tipped/pointed tip/straight or curved. straight mayo scissors are designed for cutting body tissues near the surface of a wound. They are also used to cut sutures and are also known as suture-cutting scissors.
curved mayo scissors allow much deeper penetration into the wound and are used to cut thick tissues such as those found in the uterus, muscles, breast, and foot. Mayo scissors used for
dissection are placed in tissue with the tips closed. The scissors are then opened so that the tips open and spread out the tissue during the dissection process.",5779-3658.PNG,D,5796-3661.PNG;5796-3660.PNG
Q12,A 53-year-old postmenopausal woman is found to have endometrial hyperplasia with atypia. what is the next step in management?,"a)Progesterone
b)Hysterectomy
c)Mirena
d)Dilatation and curettage","Among the given options, for post-menopausal women with atypical endometrial hyperplasia, the next step in management would be a hysterectomy because the risk of progression to cancer over  time approximates 29 per cent.
Due to a high rate of finding concurrent invasive malignancy coexistent with atypical hyperplasia, the ideal management is to perform a fractional curettage with hysteroscopy before proceeding
with a hysterectomy (with removal of both tubes and ovaries).
Endometrial hyperplasia is endometrial thickening with a proliferation of irregularly sized and shaped glands along with an increased gland-to-stroma ratio.
classification of endometrial hyperplasia:



• simple hyperplasia is characterised by dilated or cystic glands with round to slightly irregular shapes, an increased glandular-to-stromal ratio without glandular crowding, and no cytologic    atypia.
• complex hyperplasia has architecturally complex (budding and infolding) crowded glands, with less intervening stroma without atypia.
• Atypical hyperplasia refers to cytologic atypia and can be categorised as simple or complex, depending on the corresponding glandular architecture. criteria for cytologic atypia include
•
• large nuclei of variable size and shape with lost polarity
• increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios
• prominent nucleoli
• irregularly clumped chromatin with parachromatin clearing

Q13,"A 16-year-old female patient presents with an ovarian mass. on further evaluation, her serum biomarkers are found to be normal except for LDH, which is found to be elevated. The most    likely diagnosis is:","a)Dysgerminoma
b)Endodermal sinus tumor
c)Malignant teratoma
d)Mucinous cystadeno carcinom","The given clinical history of a 16-year-old female presenting with an ovarian mass and raised LDH, points towards the diagnosis of dysgerminoma.
Dysgerminoma corresponds to the seminoma of the testis and accounts for 3-5% of all ovarian
tumors. It usually arises in young girls or in children, with an average age of 2o years. It is the
most common malignant tumor of the ovary. It is usually unilateral, but they are the only germ
cell malignancy with a significant rate of bilateral ovarian involvement (15-2o%) and can be found at gonadal or extragonadal sites.
Genetics:
• Express OcT-3, OcT-4 and NANOG
• Activating mutations in the KIT gene in one-third of cases
pathology:
• solid neoplasm with areas of softening due to degeneration with fleshy consistency



• Mimics the pattern of the primitive gonad, lymphocytic infiltration is seen
It presents with abdominal pain, distension, a palpable mass and ascites. some tumors occur in
patients with gonadal dysgenesis, including pseudohermaphroditism. It secretes placental alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase and beta-HCG, but no sex hormones.
Morphology and histology:
• Most dysgerminomas (8o% to 9o%) are unilateral tumors ranging in size from barely visible nodules to masses that virtually fill the abdomen.
• on cut surfaces, they have a solid yellow-white to gray-pink appearance and are often soft and fleshy.
• Like seminoma, it is composed of large vesicular cells with clear cytoplasm, well-defined cell boundaries, and centrally placed regular nuclei.
• The tumor cells grow in sheets or cords separated by scant fibrous stroma, which is infiltrated by lymphocytes and may contain noncaseating granulomas
The image below shows the histopathology of a dysgerminoma, characterized by uniform cells resembling primordial germ cells separated by fibrous septa with lymphocytes.


Management:
• Though dysgerminomas are radiosensitive, they are contraindicated due to ovarian destruction in young girls. It is employed only for residual and recurrent tumors.
• Treatment includes surgical removal and postoperative chemotherapy. Chemotherapy comprises of
• Injection bleomycin 15 mg i.v (or) i.m weekly for 12 weeks
• Injection etoposide 1oomg/m2 1-5 days every 3 weeks
• Injection cisplatin 2o mg/m2 1-5 days 3 weeks",,A,5798-3662.PNG

c)Low MSAFP, high hcG, high UE3
d)High MSAFP, low hcG, low UE3","The triple test findings in pregnancies with fetal Down’s syndrome are characterized by:
• Low MSAFP (maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein) levels, approximately o.7 MoM (multiples of median).
• Low unconjugated estriol levels, approximately o.8 MoM.
• High hcG levels, approximately 2.o MoM.

Q16,which of the following drug must always be available for emergency use in labor ward if a patient is on opioid analgesic?,"a)Fentanyl
b)Naloxone
c)Morphine
d)Bupivacaine","Naloxone is a narcotic antagonist capable of reversing respiratory depression induced by opioid narcotics.
It acts by displacing the narcotic from specific receptors in the central nervous system.
Naloxone:
It is a competitive antagonist on all types of opioid receptors.  It is devoid of any kind of agonistic activity even at high doses. Injected intravenously (o.4–o.8 mg) it promptly antagonizes all
actions of morphine: analgesia is gone, respiration is not only normalized but
stimulated—probably due to sudden sensitization of the respiratory centre to the retained Co2, or it may be a manifestation of acute withdrawal; pupils dilate. However, sedation is less completely  reversed.
Naloxone is inactive orally because of high first-pass metabolism in the liver. Injected i.v. it acts in 2–3 min. The primary pathway of metabolism is glucuronidation. Plasma t½ is 1 hour in adults
and 3 hours in newborns. Duration of action is 1–3 hrs.
Adverse effects of naloxone are uncommon, and may include a rise in BP and pulmonary edema; Naloxone o.4 mg i.v. precipitates morphine withdrawal in dependent subjects: the syndrome
lasting 2–3 hours.
uses of naloxone:
• drug of choice for morphine poisoning (o.4–o.8 mg i.v. every 2–3 min: max 1o mg)
• reversing neonatal asphyxia due to opioid use during labour (1o µg/kg in the cord)
• treat the overdose with other opioids and agonist-antagonists (except buprenorphine)
• to reverse respiratory depression due to intraoperative use of opioids: o.1–o.2 mg i.v. (this dose usually preserves analgesia in the postoperative period)



• tried as an adjunct to intraspinal opioid analgesia: reverses respiratory depression without abolishing pain relief
Naloxone is contraindicated in newborns of narcotic-addicted mothers as it can lead to neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS).
NAS is a drug-withdrawal syndrome that most commonly follows in-utero exposure to maternal opioids. It also can complicate exposure to alcohol or benzodiazepines. The syndrome shows
hypertonia, autonomic instability, irritability, poor sucking reflex, and seizures. care includes close observation and pharmacotherapy with morphine and methadone. Naloxone is not
recommended as it can precipitate withdrawal symptoms.",,B,
Q17,A pregnant lady of 49 kg is in her first trimester. what are her additional calorie requirements in this trimester?,"a)5oo
b)3oo
c)continue same diet
d)6oo","The pregnant lady can continue the same diet since there are no additional calorie requirements in the first trimester.
pregnancy requires an additional 8o,ooo kcal, mostly during the last 2o weeks. To meet this
demand, a caloric increase of 1oo to 3oo kcal/d is recommended during pregnancy. This greater intake, however, should not be divided equally during the course of pregnancy. The Institute of
Medicine (2oo6) recommends adding o, 34o, and 452 kcal/d to the estimated nonpregnant energy requirements in the first, second, and third trimesters respectively.
whenever caloric intake is inadequate, protein is metabolized rather than being spared for its vital role in fetal growth and development.",,C,
Q18,"A 18 year old girl with primary amenorrhea, no breast development and Prader 3 genitalia was found to have raised FSH. Her karyotype revealed 45 Xo/46 Xy and USG revealed
Mullerian structures with poorly visualized gonads. what would be the next line of management?","a)vaginoplasty
b)Bilateral gonadectomy
c)HRT to induce puberty
d)clitoroplasty","In Turner's syndrome, most affected individuals have a 45,x karyotype, while others have mosaic   karyotypes (45,x/46,xx; 45,x/46,xy).The presence of y chromosome material is associated with a 12% risk of a gonadoblastoma. If a y chromosome is identified, laparoscopic prophylactic
gonadectomy is recommended at the time of diagnosis to eliminate the risk of malignancy.
• Gonadoblastomas can be precursors to germ cell malignancies, such as dysgerminomas (most commonly), teratomas, embryonal carcinomas, or endodermal sinus tumors.
• The karyotype should be determined in any individual with delayed puberty and increased basal FSH concentrations.
• Regardless of the karyotype, the individual with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism has some form of ovarian “failure”

Q20,"The deepest part of perineal body injury, which causes cystocoele, enterocoele and urethral descent is ____","a)Pubococcygeous
b)Bulbospongiosus
c)Ischiocavernous
d)superficial transverse perineal","pubococcygeus is the deepest part of the levator ani muscle. Injury to it can cause enterocele, cystocele, and urethral descent.
Levator ani muscles are the most important muscles in the pelvic floor and maintain a constant state of contraction. They provide a stable floor and support the weight of the abdominopelvic
contents against intra-abdominal forces. weakening of levator ani and pelvic fascia from
stretching or tearing during childbirth, may decrease support for the vagina, bladder, uterus, or rectum or alter the position of the neck of the bladder and urethra.
The levator ani muscle is a complex unit, which consists of 3 muscle components namely
• pubococcygeus (anterior fibers)
• pubovaginalis - elevates the urethra and hence contributes to urinary continence
• puboperinealis - draws the perineal body towards the pubic symphysis
• puboanalis - elevates the anus and keeps the urogenital hiatus narrowed
• puborectalis (intermediate fibers)
• Iliococcygeus (posterior fibers)
origin: The levator ani muscle has a linear origin from the pelvic surface of the body of the pubis, a tendinous arch of obturator fascia, and the pelvic surface of the ischial spine.
Insertion:
• The anterior fibres form a sling around the prostate (levator prostatae) or vagina (sphincter vaginae) and are inserted into the perineal body (a mass of fibrous tissue) in front of the anal canal.
• The intermediate fibres (puborectalis) form a sling around the anorectal junction to be inserted  into the anococcygeal raphe (a fibrous raphe which extends from the anorectal junction to the tip



of the coccyx).
• The posterior fibres (iliococcygeus) are inserted into the anococcygeal raphe and the coccyx. Nerve supply:
• perineal branch of 4th sacral nerve (s4) from its pelvic surface.
• perineal branch of the pudendal nerve (s2, s3) from its perineal surface. Actions:
• The levator ani muscles of two sides together support the pelvic viscera and resist the
intra-abdominal pressure during straining and expulsive efforts of the anterior abdominal wall muscles.
• They also subserve a sphincteric action on the anorectal junction to maintain the continence of faeces in both sexes and vagina in females.

Q21,which is not seen in pregnancy induced hypertension:,"a)systemic hypertension within 1o weeks of gestation
b)Diabetic nephropathy
c)Diabetic retinopathy
d)Thrombocytopenia","Hypertension induced by pregnancy is gestational hypertension which is characterized by BP more than 14o/9o mmHg after 2o weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive woman.
The incidence of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is remarkably increased in diabetic mothers.
4o% of pregnant women with diabetes will develop preeclampsia. chronic hypertension with overt diabetes increased the risk of preeclampsia to 6o%

Q22,"A couple with 2 children who are not able to conceive for over an year now present to the
OPD. The male partner is diagnosed to be having hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. which of the following is not true ?","a)Low LH AND FsH
b)Low testosterone
c)Oligospermia
d)Low prolactin levels","A male with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism will have high prolactin levels.
Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism:
• Low LH &amp;FSH
• Low testosterone
• Low testicular volume (oligospermia)
• High prolactin levels
Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism:
• High LH and FSH
• Low testosterone
• Low testicular volume (oligospermia)
• High prolactin level
Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism:
It can be congenital or acquired. congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is divided into anosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (kallmann syndrome) and congenital normosmic  isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism).
Acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism can be caused by drugs, infiltrative or infectious
pituitary lesions, hyperprolactinemia, encephalic trauma, pituitary/brain radiation, exhausting  exercise, abusive alcohol or illicit drug intake, and systemic diseases such as hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis and histiocytosis X.
The clinical characteristics of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism are androgen deficiency and a
lack/delay/stop of pubertal sexual maturation. Low blood testosterone levels and low LH and FSH levels confirm the diagnosis. A prolonged stimulated intravenous GnRH test can be useful. In



kallmann syndrome, cerebral MRI can show an anomalous morphology or even absence of the olfactory bulb.
Therapy for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism depends on the patient's desire for future fertility. Hormone replacement with testosterone is the classic treatment for hypogonadism. Androgen
replacement is indicated for men who already have children or have no desire to induce
pregnancy, and testosterone therapy is used to reverse the symptoms and signs of hypogonadism. conversely, GnRH or gonadotropin therapies are the best options for men wishing to have
children.",,D,

Gravida and para refer to pregnancies and not to babies.
Gravida: Total number of pregnancies including the present one.
Para: Total number of pregnancies crossing the period of viability, which is 28 weeks in India.
As such, a woman who delivers twins in the first pregnancy is still a gravida 1 and para 1. A
pregnant woman with a previous history of 2 abortions and 1 term delivery can be expressed as 4th Gravida but primipara.



It is customary in clinical practice to summarise the past obstetric history by 2 digits
First digit: Number of viable births
Second digit: Number of abortions
Both digits connected with a “+” sign affixing the letter P.

Q27,"A 32 year old female nearing her due date has been admitted following regular contractions. The resident doctor did an examination and told the intern that the head is at +1 station.
where is the exact position of head?","a)At the perineum
b)Just below ischial spine
c)Just above ischial spine
d)High up in the false pelvis","The station is just below the ischial spine.
Station of the head is in relation to ischial spines as spines are the most prominent bony projections felt on internal examination.
The level of ischial spines is the halfway between the pelvic inlet and outlet. This level is known as station zero (o).
The levels above and below the spines are divided into fifths to represent centimeters. The station is said to be “0” if the presenting part is at the level of the spines. The station is stated in minus     figures, if it is above the spines (–1 cm, –2 cm, –3 cm, –4 cm and –5 cm) and in plus figures if it is below the spines (+1 cm, +2 cm, +3 cm, +4 cm and +5 cm).

Q31,"A 25 year old female came with complaints of 4 months amenorrhea. Her FSH and LH were elevated above the normal value, thyroid function tests were normal. which is the next step  in management ?","a)Estimate serum estradiol values
b)Give progesterone and stop after 1o days for withdrawal bleeding
c)check USG for polycystic ovaries
d)Do a urine pregnancy test","• Since LH and FSH are elevated above the normal value, the possibility of a pregnancy can be ruled out.  Therefore no need to do a urine pregnancy test.
• Hence the next step in management would be to check serum estradiol levels to evaluate amenorrhea.
In pregnancy,
• hcG stimulates Relaxin which inhibits LH.
• Inhibin A suppresses FSH.
• Therefore, LH and FSH are low.
Evaluation of amenorrhea :
categories of amenorrhea based on Gonadotrophin and Estrogen levels.
• Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism



• Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
• Eugonadotropic hypogonadism
The given clinical picture fits into hypergonadotropic hypogonadism.
Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism describes any process in which:
(1) ovarian function is decreased or absent (hypogonadism) and
(2) Due to absent negative sex-steroid feedback, LH and FSH, have increased serum levels. It is also called premature ovarian Failure.
Hormonal levels in poF
• Increased LH, FSH
• Low serum estradiol levels
• High levels of serum prolactin
Hence, the next best step would be to test serum estradiol levels.

examination she had a strawberry cervix. which of the following is the treatment for her","a)Doxycycline
b)Amoxicillin
c)Fluconazole
d)Metronidazole","The above case suggests Trichomonas vaginalis infection and the treatment of choice
is metronidazole.
The greenish-colored vaginal discharge along with the strawberry cervix is characteristic of infection with Trichomonas vaginalis which can be an STD.
The treatment regimen includes:
• Metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose (or 4oo mg 3 times/day for 5 days) is the standard
treatment. It should be taken at night, after meals to avoid vomiting. If this too causes vomiting, or in resistant cases consider the use of alternative drugs.
• The alternative regimen includes tinidazole 2g as a single dose or secnidazole in a single dose of 2g. Single-dose therapy ensures better compliance.
• Both partners need to be given treatment at the same time to prevent the risk of recurrence. The given image below shows strawberry cervix in trichomonas infection:",,D,5807-3666-1.png

• Estimate CA – 125 level
• USG
• Calculating Risk of Malignancy indeX
• RMI = U X  M  X  Ca-125
• U – Ultrasound score
• M – Menopausal status
• Ca 125 – Serum levels

Q35,"In endometriotic lesion, histology represents its:","a)High cholesterol
b)High estrogen
c)High levels of prolactin
d)High progesterone","In endometriotic lesions, histology represents its high estrogen activity.
Endometriosis is defined by the presence of “ectopic” endometrial tissue at a site outside of the
uterus.  Endometriosis is a proliferative hormone-dependent disease of the childbearing period. It is eXtremely rare before menarche and disappears after menopause.
The endometriotic implants show certain differences when compared to normal endometrium.
There is increased production of estrogen by endometriotic stromal cells due to high levels of the enzyme aromatase. This is absent in normal endometrial stroma.
