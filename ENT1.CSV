Q1,A 25-year-old woman presented with hearing loss that developed shortly after her first pregnancy. Her audiometry report is given below. what is the diagnosis?,"a)ototoxicity
b)Meniere disease
c)otosclerosis
d)Noise induced hearing loss","The clinical scenario describes a patient with post-pregnancy hearing loss. The audiogram shows conductive deafness along with carhart's notch (dip in bone conduction at 2ooo Hz). These
findings are highly suggestive of otosclerosis.

ototoxicity, Meniere’s disease, and noise-induced hearing loss cause sensory neural hearing loss (SNHL) and not conductive hearing loss.
otosclerosis is caused by bony overgrowth involving the enchondral layer of the bony otic capsule. It presents with bilateral progressive conductive hearing loss and tinnitus. It has an autosomal
dominant inheritance and can worsen with stress and hormonal changes like during pregnancy and menopause.
Stapedial otosclerosis is the most common type of otosclerosis. Here the lesion starts just in front of the oval window in an area called fistula ante fenestrae.
The presence of a reddish hue on the promontory through the tympanic membrane, known as the Schwartze sign, suggests an active focus. PTA shows loss of air conduction with air-bone gap,
more for lower frequencies and carhart's notch may be seen. Tympanometry shows an As type of tympanogram in which there is reduced compliance at or near the ambient air pressure.
Medical management with sodium fluoride is used in the active stage. Definitive treatment is
stapedectomy/stapedotomy with the placement of a prosthesis. carhart notch usually disappears after a successful stapedectomy.
other options:
option A: ototoxicity causes SNHL and shows a high-frequency hearing loss in the SNHL curve.
option B: In Meniere's disease, pure tone audiometry shows an SNHL pattern with a rising curve in the early stages (as lower frequencies are involved first) and as the disease progresses higher     frequencies are involved, the curve becomes flat or a falling type.
option D: Noise-induced hearing loss is SNHL and PTA shows a characteristic acoustic dip at 4ooo Hz both for air and bone conduction.",3188-1954.PNG,C,
Q2,kraissl’s lines are,"a)point of maximum tension in a fracture
b)Relaxed Tension lines in skin
c)collagen and elastin lines in stab injury
d)point of tension in hanging","kraissl's lines are relaxed tension lines in the skin. They lie perpendicular to the long axis of the
underlying muscle. They were described in living individuals and reflect underlying muscle action.
Image of kraissl's lines:



Langer's lines correspond to the natural orientation of collagen fibers in the dermis and are generally parallel to the orientation of the underlying muscle fibers. They were described in cadavers in reference to rigor mortis.
Image of Langer's lines:


Borge's lines are also relaxed skin tension lines observed by pinching the skin in living individuals.
Borge's lines and kraissl's lines are a better guide for elective incisions in the face and body than Langer's lines.
Linear incisions in the skin tend to have variable degrees of gaping. when a circular skin incision is performed, the skin defect acquires an elliptical configuration. By aligning circular incisions
perpendicular to the muscle action, surgeons can minimize tension on the wound edges, reduce the risk of scar contracture, and achieve better cosmetic results.

Q3,Identify the following line shown in the below picture:,"a)Frankfort line
b)Donaldson line
c)Line of sebileau
d)ohngren line","The given image shows ohngren's line. It is an imaginary line passing through the medial canthus of the eye and the angle of the mandible. It is used for the classification of maxillary carcinoma.
Growth situated above the plane (supra structure) tends to be more aggressive and poorly
differentiated and has a poor prognosis. Growth situated below the plane (infrastructure) is more amenable to treatment and has a better prognosis.
other options:
option A: proper alignment of the face is determined by the Frankfort plane, a horizontal line bisecting the inferior border of the infraorbital rim and the superior border of the external
auditory canal.
option B: Donaldson's line passes through the horizontal semicircular canal and bisects the
posterior canal. It is the landmark for the endolymphatic sac which lies anterior and inferior to it.


ELS: Endolymphatic sac, HScc: Horizontal semicircular canal, pScc: posterior semicircular
canal, pF dura: posterior fossa dura

option C: Ledermann’s classification uses two horizontal lines of sebileau, one passes through the floor of the orbit and another passes through the floor of the maxillary antra dividing the face into supra structure (ethmoid, sphenoid, frontal sinuses, and the olfactory area of nose), mesostructure (maxillary sinus and respiratory part of nose) and infrastructure (alveolar process). It is used to
classify maxillary carcinoma.",3189-1956.PNG,D,3194-1959.PNG;3195-1960.PNG
Q4,The given image is of a patient in whom mastoidectomy is done. Identify the lateral semi-circular canal:,"a)A
b)B
c)c
d)D","The structure marked as ‘B’ in the given image represents the lateral (horizontal) semi-circular canal. The tympanic (horizontal) segment of the facial nerve lies below the lateral horizontal     semicircular canal.
other markings represent:
A: superior semicircular canal (ssC)
C: posterior semicircular canal (psC)
D: Incus
The semicircular canals are positioned in the superior part of the mastoid region. These canals are situated adjacent to the middle ear, with the lateral semicircular canal being the nearest to the
middle ear. The superior and posterior canals share a common crescent-shaped space in between. The one that lies in close proximity to the lateral semicircular canal is the posterior semicircular    canal.



The semicircular canals are part of the bony labyrinth. They house the semicircular ducts which are the end organs for angular momentum. They are 3 semicircular canals, lateral (horizontal),  superior (anterior), and posterior. They lie in planes at right angles to one another.
stimulation of semicircular canals produces nystagmus. The nystagmus is rotatory from the superior canal, horizontal from the horizontal canal, and vertical from the posterior canal.",3189-1955.PNG,B,3196-1962.PNG;3196-1961.PNG
Q5,which of the following is not a branch of the external carotid artery in kiesselbach’s plexus?,"a)Anterior and posterior ethmoidal
b)sphenopalatine artery
c)Greater palatine artery
d)septal branch of superior labial","Anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries are branches of the ophthalmic artery which in turn is a branch of the internal carotid artery.
kiesselbach’s plexus is an arterial anastomosis at the anterior inferior part of the nasal septum
(Little's area). It includes the anterior ethmoidal artery, septal branch of the superior labial artery,

septal branch of the sphenopalatine artery, and septal branch of the greater palatine artery. It is the usual site of epistaxis in children and young adults.
The blood supply of the nasal septum can be divided into two main systems, the internal carotid system, and the external carotid system.
• Internal carotid system: Branches of the ophthalmic artery, anterior ethmoidal artery, and posterior ethmoidal artery.
• External carotid system: sphenopalatine artery (branch of the maxillary artery) gives
nasopalatine and posterior medial nasal branches, septal branch of the greater palatine artery (branch of the maxillary artery), and septal branch of the superior labial artery (branch of the  facial artery).",,A,3197-1963.PNG
Q6,A metal factory worker suffers from noise-induced hearing loss. which of the following structures will be affected?,"a)crista ampullaris
b)Macula
c)cupola
d)outer hair cells","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) damages the outer hair cells, starting in the basal turn of the cochlea. outer hair cells are affected before the inner hair cells.
NIHL occurs after chronic exposure to less intense sounds. The damage caused by noise trauma     depends on the frequency of noise (frequency of 2ooo to 3ooo Hz causes more damage) intensity, duration of the noise, and preexisting ear disease.
The audiogram in noise-induced hearing loss shows a typical notch at 4oooHz both for air and bone conduction known as acoustic dip/boiler's notch. patients at this stage complain of
high-pitched tinnitus and difficulty hearing in noisy surroundings. pre-employment and annual audiograms for persons working at places where noise is above 85 dB (A) help in the early
detection of NIHL.
The human ear can hear frequencies from about 2o to 2o,ooo Hz. Below 2o Hz, the vibrations are infra-audible, and above 2o,ooo Hz, they are ultra-sonic. pure tone audiometry can detect only up to 8ooo Hz.

Extended high-frequency audiometry is recommended for early detection of hearing loss, as it can identify hearing impairments before the frequencies necessary for speech comprehension are
affected. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions is a more sensitive tool than conventional
audiometry, particularly in children under 5 years old for early detection of hearing loss.
A noise of 9o dB(A) SPL (acceptable noise levels, sound pressure level), 8 hours a day for 5 days    per week is the maximum safe limit as recommended by the Ministry of Labour. As per WHo, 85 dB(A) is considered the highest safe exposure level up to a maximum of 8 hours.
The silence zone extends to a distance of 1oo meters around the premises of hospitals, nursing homes, educational institutions, and courts.
Permissible limits of noise as per the noise pollution (Regulation and control) rules:
Noise levels are measured in dB(A), which prioritizes middle-range frequencies for assessing noise-induced hearing loss while giving less weightage to low and high frequencies.
The image below shows an acoustic dip at 4oooHz:

zone/Are a	Day(6 am to 1o pm) limits in dB(A)	Night(1o pm to 6 am) limits i n dB(A)
Industria l	75	7o
commerc ial	65	55
Residenti al	55	45
Silence	5o	4o


other options:
option A: crista ampullaris is a thickened ridge of neuroepithelium in the ampullated end of semicircular ducts.

option B: Macula is the sensory epithelium of the utricle
option C: Cupula is a gelatinous mass extending from the surface of the crista (peripheral receptor located in the ampullated end of semicircular ducts) to the ceiling of the ampulla, into which
project the cilia of sensory hair cells.",,D,3198-1964.PNG
Q7,Rhinosporidium seeberi is now classified as a/an _________,"a)Aquatic protistan protozoa
b)Fungus
c)virus
d)Bacteria","Rhinosporidium seeberi is not a classic fungus, but rather the first known human pathogen from the DRIps (Dermocystidium, Rosette agent, Icthyophonus, and posorospermum) clade, a novel    clade of aquatic protistan parasites (Ichthyosporea).
It causes a granulomatous disease called rhinosporidiosis. It is endemic in south India. patients typically have a history of bathing in water bodies shared by animals and present with
recurrent epistaxis, nasal obstruction by a red vascular mass (mulberry mass), and hypertrophic turbinates.
For diagnosis, a nasal smear can be taken to demonstrate sporangia.
Treatment is surgical excision of the mass with a diathermy knife and cauterization of base.
Dapsone can also be used postoperatively to reduce the incidence of recurrence.
The image below shows a polypoidal mass of rhinosporidiosis:",,A,3199-1965.PNG
Q8,which of the following is not ligated for the control of epistaxis,"a)Internal carotid artery
b)Anterior ethmoidal artery
c)Maxillary artery
d)External carotid artery","The internal carotid artery is not ligated in epistaxis control due to a high percentage of cerebral complications and high mortality.
The first step in treating epistaxis is to pinch the nose with the thumb and index finger for about 5 minutes. The patient should sit leaning slightly forward over a basin to spit out blood and breathe through the mouth (Hippocratic or Trotter’s method).

If the bleeding point is localized, cauterization can be done with electrocautery. In cases of
uncontrolled bleeding or when the bleeding is posterior into the throat, anterior or posterior nasal packing may be required, respectively. If bleeding continues despite these measures, endoscopic     procedures or vessel ligation can be considered.
The sphenopalatine artery is ligated first through a trans-nasal endoscope (Transnasal endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation). However, if the bleeding persists, maxillary artery ligation is
done. If bleeding is still not controlled, external carotid artery ligation is done. It is important to note that if the bleeding site is located superior to the level of the middle turbinate, the anterior  and posterior ethmoidal arteries should be ligated.",,A,
Q9,A 5 year old with gradually progressive hoarseness of voice over three months and respiratory distress for 2 weeks. Diagnosis is,"a)croup
b)Respiratory papillomatosis
c)vocal nodule
d)Acute epiglottitis","The given clinical scenario of a child presenting with chronic hoarseness (3 months) of voice and respiratory distress for 2 weeks suggests the diagnosis of respiratory papillomatosis (juvenile
papillomatosis).
Croup (option A) and acute epiglottitis (option D), which cause acute upper respiratory tract
obstruction, are ruled out due to the chronic nature of the symptoms. In croup, the upper airway   obstruction becomes apparent after 1 to 3 days of low-grade fever, rhinorrhea, and pharyngitis. on the other hand, in epiglottitis, a child experiences respiratory distress within hours of developing   a fever.
vocal nodules (option C) are not typically associated with respiratory distress.
Respiratory papillomatosis is the most common respiratory tract neoplasm in children. They are simple warts (benign tumors) caused by human papillomavirus types 6 and 11 commonly seen in children aged 3 to 5 years.
The course involves remissions and exacerbations of recurrent papillomas, mostly affecting the glottic area (vocal cords), and supraglottis. The patient presents with progressively worsening    hoarseness, sleep-disordered breathing, dyspnea, stridor, and severe airway obstruction if left   untreated.
Diagnosis confirmed by direct laryngoscopy, which shows grape-like projections (shown below), and biopsy. Treatment consists of micro laryngoscopy and Co2 laser excision. Antivirals like
interferon alpha2a, ribavirin, cidofovir, and acyclovir are used as adjunct therapies.



other options:
option A: Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is caused by the parainfluenza virus. The patient
initially presents with an upper respiratory tract infection (rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, cough,
low-grade fever) followed by a characteristic barking cough, hoarseness, and inspiratory stridor.    option C: vocal nodule (singer’s or screamer's nodule) occurs as a result of chronic vocal abuse.    They appear symmetrically at the junction of the anterior one-third and posterior two third of the vocal cord. The patient presents with chronic hoarseness and voice fatigue.
The image below shows symmetric vocal nodules:


option D: Acute epiglottitis is caused by streptococcus pyogenes, pneumococci, Hemophilus
influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus. It is characterized by an acute rapidly progressive course of high-grade fever, dyspnea, and stridor.",,B,3201-1967.PNG;3201-1966.PNG
