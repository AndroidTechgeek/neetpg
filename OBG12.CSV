Q1,A partogram of a woman who is in labor is shown below. oxytocin infusion is already given. How will you manage the condition?,"a)Forceps-assisted delivery
b)vacuum-assisted delivery
c)oxytocin infusion
d)cesarean section","Based on the above partogram, there is a cephalopelvic disproportion, and the management, in this case, would be to do an emergency cesarian section.
The above partogram shows that the cervix is fully dilated, molding is 2+, the station is 3+, and
oxytocin infusion is already given. The patient has adequate uterine contractions, as shown. The     amniotic fluid is stained with meconium, and there is a fall in fetal heart rate, which indicates that the baby is in distress. This shows that there is an arrest of the fetal head with molding, which
points to cephalopelvic disproportion.
In case of uterine inertia or fetal distress, the management is an emergency cesarean section, not instrumental delivery or elective cesarean section.
Cephalopelvic disproportion is a state where the normal proportion between the size of the fetal head to the size of the pelvis is disturbed. It can either occur due to an average size baby with a  small pelvis or a relatively large baby with a normal pelvis.
CPD can occur at the inlet, mid-pelvis, or at pelvic outlet. It is diagnosed at these levels by the following measurements.
Inlet CPD
• obstetric conjugate &lt; 1o cm
• Diagonal conjugate &lt; 11 cm
• Transverse diameter &lt; 12 cm
Midpelvis CPD
• sum of the interspinous and posterior sagittal diameters of the mid pelvis ≤13 cm
• Interspinous diameter &lt; 8 cm
outlet CPD
• Interischial diameter ≤ 8 cm.
The following events may occur over the course of labor, depending on the degree of pelvic contraction.
• Early rupture of the membranes.
• Cord prolapse
• Cervical dilatation is slowed.
• obstructed labor with features of exhaustion, dehydration, ketoacidosis, and sepsis.
• operative interference, shock, postpartum hemorrhage, and sepsis.
The degree of disproportion must be assessed by clinical examination and supplemented by imaging pelvimetry. The moderate and the severe degrees can be managed by one of the



following:
• Induction of labor
• Elective cesarean section at term
• Trial labor
The elective cesarean section at term is commonly done in cases of a major degree of inlet
contraction and in a moderate degree of inlet contraction associated with outlet contraction or    complicating factors like elderly primigravida, malpresentation, post-cesarean pregnancy, etc. It is planned during the last week of pregnancy.",6166-3840.PNG,D,
Q2,"A woman presents to you at 36 weeks of gestation with complaints of breathlessness and
excessive abdominal distension. Fetal movements are normal. on examination, fetal parts are not easily felt and fetal heartbeat is heard but it is muffled. Her symphysis fundal height is 41
cm. Her abdomen is tense but not tender. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Abruptio placenta
b)Hydrocephalus of fetus
c)polyhydramnios
d)Fetal-maternal ascites","The diagnosis in this case in which symphysis fundal height (SFH) is 41 cm at 36 weeks of
gestation and the woman presents with breathlessness and excessive abdominal distension is most likely polyhydramnios.
polyhydramnios can be defined as the presence of excessive amniotic fluid, which exceeds 2,ooo mL.
The sonographic diagnosis of polyhydramnios can be given as
• AFI ≥25 cm
• Deepest vertical pocket (DVp) measuring &gt;8 cm
causes of polyhydramnios can be due to maternal and fetal conditions-
• Maternal causes include chorioangioma of the placenta, multiple pregnancies commonly in monozygotic twins, disorders of the cardiac or the renal system, and diabetes mellitus.
• Fetal causes include anencephaly, spina bifida, atretic esophagus or duodenum, facial clefts, and neck masses that lead to abnormal swallowing or hydrops fetalis.
patients may present with dyspnea, palpitations, and pedal edema.
on examination, the following findings can be elicited:
• Markedly enlarged abdomen with flank fullness
• Tense, shiny skin with striae
• Fundal height more than the appropriate gestational age: The SFH measured in cm after 24
weeks is equivalent to the number of weeks up to 36 weeks. A variance of 2 cm is regarded as     typical. The SFH in 36 weeks of gestation should have been 36±2 cms, which is less than in this patient.
• Fetal parts and the presentation cannot be well-defined
• Fluid thrill will be present
on per vaginal examination, tensed bulging membranes can be felt. Investigations to confirm the diagnosis include an ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis and an evaluation of possible causes.
other options:



option A - placental abruption classically presents with sudden onset of abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and uterine tenderness. Frequent contractions and persistent hypertonus are the other findings. when the placenta is completely detached from the uterine wall, except at the margin,  blood may collect behind the placenta. This kind of presentation is known as concealed type. In   another type, blood can escape via the cervix by dissecting downward between the membranes     and the uterine wall. It is called the revealed type, which is the most common type.
option B - Hydrocephalus ofthe fetus: Hydrocephalus is a condition where there is an abnormal  accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid within the brain, leading to increased head circumference in  the fetus. Although it may lead to an increased symphysis fundal height, the clinical presentation of breathlessness and excessive abdominal distension in the mother is not typical of this
condition.
option D - Fetal-maternal ascites can present as Mirror syndrome. There is a connection between fetal hydrops and the onset of maternal edema, in which the mother exhibits the same symptoms  as the fetus. Because the mother, the placenta, and the fetus all develop edema, the condition is     also called triple edema. At least 2o% of cases of hydrops have been observed to be complicated    by mirror syndrome. women most commonly present with edema. other symptoms may include  proteinuria, hypertension, the elevation of liver enzymes, and headache.",,C,
Q3,"For which of the following procedures in the given OT list, can you preferably do a hysteroscopy?","a)Tubal ligation
b)Asherman syndrome
c)Endocervical polyp
d)subserosal fibroid","of the following procedures given in the oT list, Asherman syndrome is the condition for which hysteroscopy would be most preferable. Hysteroscopy is used for the definitive diagnosis of
Asherman syndrome.
Asherman syndrome refers to the presence of adhesion within the endometrial cavity. It is also called uterine synechiae and can be asymptomatic tiny bands or can completely or almost
completely obliterate the endometrial cavity. It can occur as a result of trauma to the
endometrium following vigorous uterine curettage, tuberculous endometritis, pelvic radiation, or endometrial ablation.
Depending on the degree of scarring, patients may have amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, or
recurrent pregnancy loss because of inadequate placentation. Hysterosalpingography is performed to assess the uterine cavity and tubal patency. Intrauterine adhesions are characteristically seen
as irregular angulated filling defects in the uterine cavity with a classic 'moth-eaten'
appearance. Definitive diagnosis (gold standard) and management are done by hysteroscopy.
Hysteroscopic transection is the surgical treatment of choice.
Hysteroscopy has the advantage of being a minimally invasive procedure with lower risks and faster recovery times than traditional open surgery. It is often performed as an outpatient
procedure, and patients can usually return to their normal activities within a day or two.
other options-
option A - Tubal ligation is done to attain permanent contraception in females, which is usually
accomplished by occlusion or division of the fallopian tubes. It prevents ovum passage and
fertilization. procedures done at the time of delivery are termed puerperal sterilization. For
puerperal sterilization, suture ligation with tubal segment removal is more frequently employed. A tubal sterilization procedure done at a time unrelated to recent pregnancy is called non-puerperal



tubal sterilization or interval sterilization. currently, non-puerperal tubal sterilization is mainly accomplished via laparoscopy.
option c - Endocercival polyps are mucinous columnar epithelium-covered benign endocervical
stroma overgrowths. They often present as a single, elongated mass that is red, smooth, and
projecting from the endocervical canal. Ring forceps are used to grab endocervical polyps for
excision if the stalk is thin. The stalk base of the polyp is repeatedly twisted. surgical ligation and excision of a thick pedicle may be necessary if further severe bleeding is expected. Although
hysteroscopy can help visualize and assess these polyps, their removal is typically performed using forceps, either during a pelvic examination or during a colposcopy. Hysteroscopy is not the
primary method for managing endocervical polyps.
option D - subserosal fibroids carry higher risks for incomplete resection, difficult visualization,    or uterine perforation with hysteroscopic myomectomy. Hence, a number of parameters are taken into consideration while choosing a surgical strategy for subserosa or intramural myomas.
successful results and low recurrence rates are seen after laparoscopic leiomyoma excision.",,B,
Q4,A primigravida presents to you with anemia early in her pregnancy. she is 7 weeks pregnant   as seen on ultrasound. Her hemoglobin level is 9 g/dL. when should the iron supplements be started for her?,"a)1o to 12 weeks
b)8 to 1o weeks
c)After 14 weeks
d)After 2o weeks","The iron supplements for the 7-week pregnant mother presenting with anemia should be started at 8 to 1o weeks.
The centers for Disease control and prevention defined anemia in pregnant women using a
cut-off value. The pregnant mother is said to be anemic when the level of hemoglobin is less than 11 g/dL in the first and third trimesters and less than 1o.5 g/dL in the second trimester.
Anemia in the first trimester is treated by oral iron therapy. According to the Anemia Mukt Bharat program, pregnant women with mild and moderate anemia are treated with two iron and folic
acid tablets. Each tablet contains 6o mg of elemental iron and 5oo mcg of folic acid. These tablets are taken daily and are supplied by the healthcare worker. Hence, in this mother iron
supplementation should be started by 8-1o weeks.
Drawbacks of oral therapy are intolerance presenting as epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting,
constipation, or diarrhea, and unpredictable absorption rate. The improvement in hemoglobin   levels is generally evident within 3 weeks of oral iron therapy. The hemoglobin concentration is expected to rise at about o.7 gm/1oo mL/week.
contraindications to oral therapy are intolerance, and severe anemia in advanced pregnancy. The best time to start corrective iron therapy in pregnancy depends on the individual patient's needs   and the presence of anemia. For most pregnant women without anemia, it is recommended to
start iron supplementation between 12-16 weeks of gestation to meet the increased iron demands during pregnancy.
If a pregnant woman is found to be anemic, the iron supplementation should be started as soon as the anemia is diagnosed, regardless of the gestational age. Early diagnosis and treatment of
anemia are crucial to reduce the risk of complications for both the mother and the baby.
In the case of severe anemia or intolerance to oral iron supplements, intravenous iron therapy
may be considered, depending on the clinical situation and the patient's response to oral therapy.",,B,
Q5,"A 5o-year-old woman presents with foul-smelling bloody discharge per vagina mixed with
mucous. On examination, a necrotizing growth is seen in the cervix with lateral parametrium involvement. what is the management for this patient?","a)chemotherapy
b)Brachytherapy
c)chemoradiation
d)surgery","This patient with a cervical tumor involving the parametrium has stage IIB cervical carcinoma, which is treated primarily with chemoradiation.
stage IIB cervical cancer refers to cancer that has extended beyond the cervix and upper vagina to the parametrial tissue. It has not spread to the pelvic sidewall or the lower third of the vagina. The primary management for stage IIB cervical cancer is concurrent chemoradiation therapy. This
involves the combination of external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and chemotherapy    (usually with cisplatin). This approach has been shown to improve overall survival and reduce the risk of local and distant recurrence compared to radiation therapy alone.
Following chemoradiation, patients should be closely monitored for treatment response and
potential side effects or complications. This includes regular physical examinations, pap tests, and imaging studies as needed. The prognosis for stage IIB cervical cancer depends on various factors, such as the size of the tumor, lymph node involvement, and the patient's overall health. with
appropriate treatment, the 5-year survival rate for stage IIB cervical cancer is around 58-63%.
other options:
option A: chemotherapy alone: chemotherapy alone is not the primary treatment for stage IIB
cervical cancer. It may be used as an adjunct to other treatments, such as radiation therapy, but is not sufficient on its own.
option B - Brachytherapy: Brachytherapy is a form of internal radiation therapy, in which a radioactive source is placed close to the tumor. while it is an important component of the    treatment for cervical cancer, it is typically not used as a standalone treatment.
option D - surgery: surgery is not the primary treatment option for stage IIB cervical cancer. In some rare cases, pelvic exenteration may be performed, but this is typically reserved for patients with recurrent or persistent disease after chemoradiation.",,C,
Q6,"A woman is set to undergo a complete laparoscopic hysterectomy. she wants to know if there are any disadvantages to this procedure. what are the disadvantages of laparoscopic over
open surgery?","a)prolonged recovery time
b)Not knowing the extent of thermal burns
c)Increased bleeding
d)Increased pain","The disadvantage of laparoscopic over open surgery is not knowing the extent of the thermal burns.
Diathermy burns are a particular hazard in laparoscopic surgery due to the following reasons:
• Relative lack of visibility of the entire instrument.
• Faulty insulation of laparoscopic instruments
• Intraperitoneal contact of the diathermy with another metal instrument while activating the pedal.
• Inadvertent activation of the pedal while the diathermy tip is out of the vision of the camera.
• Retained heat in the diathermy tip touching susceptible structures, such as the bowel. The advantages of laparoscopic over open surgery are as follows:
• Less postoperative pain (option D)
• Less blood loss (option c)



• cosmetically better
• Earlier recovery and shorter postoperative stay at the hospital (option A)
• Fewer intraoperative adhesions
• Better perception of anatomy intraoperatively",,B,
Q7,"A female presents to you with 6 weeks of amenorrhea complaining of bleeding per vagina and slight abdominal pain. The urine pregnancy test is positive and hcG level is 28oo IU/L. A
mass is seen on the left adnexa measuring 3 × 2.5 cm. she is hemodynamically stable. How will you manage this patient?","a)oral methotrexate
b)single-dose methotrexate injection
c)serial methotrexate + leucovorin rescue
d)salpingectomy","The clinical scenario of a patient with 6 weeks of amenorrhea, abdominal pain, and vaginal
bleeding with beta-hcG levels of 28oo mIU/mL and a gestational sac in the left adnexa measuring 3 × 2.5 cm points to the diagnosis of unruptured ectopic pregnancy. The most appropriate
management for this patient is a single dose of methotrexate injection.
symptoms and signs of ectopic pregnancy are often subtle or absent in unruptured ectopic
pregnancy. The classic triad includes amenorrhea, which is followed by pain and vaginal bleeding. Lower abdominal and pelvic pain is usually seen with tubal rupture. The pain is severe and
frequently described as sharp, stabbing, or tearing.
Management of ectopic pregnancy:
1. Medical management is preferred in the following cases:
• Low initial serum beta-hcG level (Less than 5,ooo IU/L)
• small ectopic pregnancy size (Less than 3.5 cm)
• Absent fetal cardiac activity
• Hemodynamically stable
The most popular method of treating ectopic pregnancies is intramuscular methotrexate injection, which can be done in single-dose or multidose protocols. The dose for single-dose therapy is 5o
mg/m2 body surface area (BsA).
single-dose therapy is preferred over the multidose protocol as the former offers simplicity, lower costs, and less involved post-therapy monitoring.
2. Expectant management: A low initial serum hcG concentration, a considerable reduction in levels over 48 hours, and a sonographic inhomogeneous mass instead of a tubal halo or other   gestational features are predictive variables for success.
3. surgical management with salpingectomy or salpingostomy is done when:
• criteria for expectant and medical management are not met
• Gestational sac &gt;3.5 cm
• Fetal cardiac activity present
• Beta-hcG &gt;5ooo mIU/mL
• significant pain and hemoperitoneum
• Failure of expectant or medical management
• clinical status of the patient warrants urgent intervention



• Doubtful compliance with medical management
other options:
option A: oral methotrexate is not the preferred route for treating ectopic pregnancy, as it may
lead to variable absorption and unreliable dosing. Intramuscular injection is the preferred route of administration for methotrexate in the management of ectopic pregnancy.
option C: serial methotrexate with leucovorin rescue is a multidose protocol that can be used to   treat ectopic pregnancy. However, the single-dose methotrexate injection is preferred in this case due to its simplicity, lower costs, and less involved post-therapy monitoring.
option D: salpingectomy, the surgical removal of the affected fallopian tube, is reserved for
patients who do not meet the criteria for medical management or expectant management, have    significant pain and hemoperitoneum, or have failed medical management. This patient does not fulfill the criteria for surgical management.",,B,
Q8,"A woman comes with complaints of pain and swelling in the perineal area. she also has
complaints of difficulty in walking and sitting. she gives a history of multiple sexual partners. on examination, a tender swelling is seen with redness on the labia, as shown in the image
given below. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)chlamydial infection
b)Bartholin abscess
c)Genital Tuberculosis
d)Herpes infection","The given clinical vignette suggests the diagnosis of Bartholin's abscess.
Bartholin glands are the homologs ofthe male bulbourethral or Cowper glands. They open into
the vestibule at approximately the 5 and 7 o’clock positions. The function of the Bartholin gland is to secrete mucus for lubrication during coitus. Bartholin cyst is caused by obstruction of the duct   due to infection, trauma, mucus changes, and congenitally narrowed ducts. If the cyst gets
infected, it leads to the formation of a Bartholin abscess. Escherichia coli is the most common  causative agent, however, other gram-positive and gram-negative organisms can also cause the same.
Most Bartholin gland cysts are small and asymptomatic except for minor discomfort during sexual contact. If the cyst is larger or infected, however, patients may complain of severe vulvar
pain during walking, sitting, or coitus. on examination, cysts typically are unilateral, round, or
ovoid, and fluctuant or tense. Infected cysts are often erythematous and tender. Most of the cysts produce labial asymmetry.
small, asymptomatic cysts can be managed conservatively. Large, symptomatic cysts can be
managed by incision and drainage, or marsupialization, or Bartholin gland excision. Bartholin abscess can be managed by incision and drainage by word catheter placement or
marsupialization. In postmenopausal women with recurrent Bartholin cysts, a suspicion of Bartholin gland cancer should arise and the cyst wall should be sent for biopsy.





other options:
option A - chlamydial infections typically present with vaginal discharge, dysuria, or cervicitis
rather than localized pain and swelling in the perineal area. Though chlamydia can cause
infections in the Bartholin gland, the symptoms described in the question are more suggestive of a Bartholin abscess.
option c - Genital tuberculosis primarily affects the upper genital tract, leading to menstrual  irregularities, infertility, and abdominal pain. while it can also involve the vulva and perineal area, the clinical presentation described in the question is not typical for genital tuberculosis.
option D - Genital herpes usually presents as painful ulcers or vesicles in the genital area, rather   than a tender, erythematous swelling. The clinical presentation in the question is more consistent with a Bartholin abscess.",6168-3841.PNG,B,6180-3842.PNG
Q9,"A 23-year-old woman accompanied by her mother-in-law comes to the infertility clinic. she
has been having regular intercourse for 6 months but is not able to conceive. what is the next best step?","a)semen analysis for husband
b)Reassure and review the couple after 6 months
c)Hysterolaparoscopy
d)Diagnostic hysteroscopy","The next best step would be to reassure and review the couple after 6 months.
The inability to conceive after 1 year of unprotected intercourse of reasonable frequency is described as infertility.
Infertility evaluation is offered to any couple that has failed to conceive after 1 year of regular   unprotected intercourse. There is a decline in the conception rate and a rise in poor pregnancy outcomes in older women hence, the majority of experts concur that in women older than 35,   evaluation may be considered after 6 months. since the woman is 23 years old and has tried
conceiving for only 6 months, it is advisable to review them in another 6 months if they fail to conceive.
Infertility workup includes the following if required:
(1) ovulation and evaluation for the diminished ovarian reserve-
(2) Evaluation of Female reproductive tract abnormality-



• Hysterosalpingography
• sonography
• Laparoscopy
• Hysteroscopy- The preferred way to diagnose intrauterine anomalies is an endoscopic
assessment of the uterine cavity. Both an operating room and a doctor's office can be used for hysteroscopy. It has the ability to concurrently diagnose and treat the abnormalities.
(3) semen analysis",,B,
Q10,A 28-year-old woman with a history of multiple sexual partners presents with lower abdominal pain for 1 month. she experiences minimal discharge and complaints of  intermenstrual bleeding. what is the most likely cause?,"a)Herpes simplex
b)Genital tuberculosis
c)candida
d)Neisseria gonorrhoea","This clinical scenario indicates infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which has led to pelvic inflammatory disease.
Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease caused by N. gonorrhoeae. It uses pili in adhesion to the urethra or other mucosal surfaces. The cocci penetrate the intracellular spaces to reach the     subepithelial tissue by the third day of infection. The incubation period is 2-8 days.
The major symptoms include vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, and dysuria, usually without urinary frequency or urgency. The specific symptoms seen in males and females are as follows:
In females:
About half the female patients remain asymptomatic. But, patients typically present with urethritis, cervical discharge, pruritus, dysuria, and intermenstrual bleeding.
The ectocervix and vagina are not usually affected in adults as the stratified squamous epithelium is resistant to infection by the cocci. The acidic pH of vaginal secretions is also
protective. The principal sites of invasion for gonococcal infection are
the columnar and transitional epithelium.
The initial infection involves the cervix uteri and urethra which may extend to Bartholin glands,  skene glands, endometrium, and fallopian tubes. unilateral pain and swelling over the labia may be caused by the inflammation of the Bartholin glands.
pelvic inflammatory disease and salpingitis may lead to sterility. other complications are
tubo-ovarian abscesses and ectopic pregnancies. Rarely peritonitis may develop with perihepatic  inflammation (Fitz-Hugh-curtis syndrome). The patient presents with right upper quadrant pain and tenderness with abnormal liver function tests.
In males:
• Acute urethritis: This infection may extend along the urethra to involve the prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymis.
• Genital discharge: It is mucopurulent that can be described as that resembling the 'flow of seed' (semen).
• strictures: chronic urethritis may lead to stricture formation.
• water-can perineum: The infection may spread to the periurethral tissues causing abscesses and multiple discharging sinuses.



other options:
option A: Herpes simplex presents as painful genital ulcers.
option B: while genital tuberculosis may present as menstrual irregularity, it is usually
accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, and weight loss. often with
concurrent pulmonary disease. It may also present as infertility or may remain asymptomatic.
option C: Vaginal candidiasis presents as intense pruritus and copious cottage cheese vaginal discharge.",,D,
Q11,"A 27-year-old pregnant G3p2L2 woman presents to you at 36+6 weeks. ultrasound is done     and shows the fetus is in a transverse lie. The liquor is adequate, the placenta is normal, and  she has no risk factors. Both her previous deliveries were normal vaginal deliveries. How will you manage this patient?","a)cesarean section
b)External cephalic version
c)Expectant management
d)Induction of labor","A pregnant woman G3p2L2 presenting at 36+6 weeks with a transverse lie without being in labor is managed with an external cephalic version (ECV), followed by vaginal delivery.
In a transverse lie, the fetus' long axis is perpendicular to the mother's. The shoulder is typically placed above the pelvic inlet when lying transversely. The head occupies one iliac fossa, and the  other by the breech. This results in a shoulder presentation.
Management of transverse lie:
1. Before labor/early in labor - If the membranes are intact (like in this case), it is recommended that ECV should be offered and attempted whenever possible.
prerequisites for ECV - women who have reached 37o/7 weeks of gestation. Multiparity,
unengaged presenting part, nonanterior placenta, nonobese patient, and abundant amnionic fluid improves the chances of ECV.
Absolute contraindications - when vaginal delivery is contraindicated, e.g. placenta previa
Relative contraindications - Early labor, oligohydramnios or ruptured membranes, known nuchal cord, structural uterine abnormalities, fetal growth restriction, multifetal gestation, and prior
abruption of the placenta
2. Active labor - A cesarean delivery is frequently necessary for such a scenario (option A). The lower uterine segment is not occupied by the fetal feet or head in a dorsoanterior or back down position. A vertical hysterotomy incision is usually necessary for such a position. In a
dorsoposterior or backup position, one or both feet can be gripped through a small transverse incision and delivered by breech extraction.
Expectant management refers to allowing vaginal delivery to happen. It is chosen when the
version fails or is contraindicated. Vaginal delivery may be considered in the case of small fetuses with congenital malformations or dead fetuses (option C).
Transverse lie (malpresentation) is a contraindication to induction of labor (option D).",,B,
Q12,"A 24-year-old woman who is being treated for infertility with human menopausal
gonadotropin came with complaints of sudden abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and breathlessness. The finding of the ultrasound is shown below. what is the most likely  diagnosis?","a)ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome
b)polycystic ovarian syndrome
c)Theca lutein cysts
d)Granulosa cell tumor","The above clinical scenario and the sonogram showing enlarged ovaries having large cysts are suggestive of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.



ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (oHSS) is characterized by multiple ovarian follicular cysts accompanied by increased capillary permeability. It happens most often as a complication of
ovulation induction therapy for infertility. It occurs due to the stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in granulosa-lutein cells by hcG.
They often present with shortness of breath, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal disturbances like nausea, vomiting, and oliguria.
Abdominal pain occurs due to ovarian enlargement and accumulation of peritoneal
fluid. Increased vascular permeability and loss of fluid, protein, and electrolytes into the
peritoneal cavity cause ascites and result in hemoconcentration. Hemoconcentration causes hyperviscosity and leads to hypercoagulability.
Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, leukocytosis, pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion can be associated with oHSS.
Some of the risk factors for oHSS:
• polycystic ovarian syndrome
• young age
• High estradiol during ovulation induction
• pregnancy
This condition can be prevented by
• using lowered FSH dose to decrease follicular stimulation
• coasting- withholding FSH administration for 1 or more days prior to the hcG trigger injection, • prophylactic treatment with volume expanders,
• Substitution of hcG for FSH during the final days of ovarian stimulation.
oHSS is primarily managed with general supportive care. paracentesis is performed to ameliorate abdominal discomfort and relieve respiratory discomfort.
other options:
option B- polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcoS) is the most common endocrine disorder of the reproductive age group. patients with pcoS present with menstrual irregularities, hirsutism,
acne, infertility, sleep apnea, and depression/anxiety. These are all short-term consequences of   pcoS. The long-term consequences of pcoS include diabetes mellitus, endometrial cancer, and cardiovascular disease.
According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE), sonographic criteria for pcoS include
• &gt;2o follicles and/or
• Increased ovarian volume (&gt;1o mL), or both
The ultrasound examination image shown below is of pcoS showing enlarged ovaries with multiple cysts.





option C - Theca lutein cysts are a type of follicular cysts. Hyperreactio luteinalis is a condition in which one or both ovaries develop multiple large theca lutein cysts. They typically occur after the  first trimester due to luteinization and hypertrophy of theca interna layer in response to
exceptionally high hCG or luteinizing hormone.
They are commonly seen in
• Gestational trophoblastic disease
• Multiple gestational pregnancy
• Fetal hydrops
• placentaomegaly
Most patients are asymptomatic and the above symptoms are not seen in this condition. surgical management is only required if it is complicated by torsion or hemorrhage.
The below image shows bilaterally enlarged ovaries with multiple theca luteal cysts as in hyperreactio luteinalis.






option D - Most women are diagnosed with adult granulosa cell tumors after the age of 3o years,  and the average age is roughly 55 years. Heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding and postmenopausal bleeding are frequent and are caused by the endometrium's extended exposure to estrogen. Breast soreness and enlargement are also seen in this condition. Instead of hormones, the mass of the
ovary may be the cause of the symptoms. Abdominal pain and distension that is brought on by an expanding tumor that could potentially be hemorrhagic.",6168-3841-1.png,A,6184-3844.PNG;6184-3843.PNG
Q13,"During a hysteroscopic removal of a submucosal fibroid, a fluid deficit of 2ooo mL is estimated in a patient. what is the immediate complication of this?","a)Acute tubular necrosis
b)DIC
c)pulmonary edema
d)Thromboembolism","The given clinical scenario suggests the diagnosis of fluid overload, and pulmonary edema is the immediate complication anticipated in this scenario.
In the context of hysteroscopic procedures, the term fluid deficit refers to the difference between the volume of distension fluid introduced into the uterine cavity and the volume of fluid that is    removed or accounted for during the procedure. A large fluid deficit indicates that a significant    amount of the distension fluid has been absorbed into the patient's bloodstream.
when a large volume of fluid is absorbed during a hysteroscopic procedure, it can lead to fluid overload. This excess fluid in the bloodstream can increase the pressure in the blood vessels,
particularly in the pulmonary circulation. The elevated pressure can cause fluid to leak from the small blood vessels in the lungs into the air spaces, resulting in pulmonary edema.
pulmonary edema can lead to shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, and impaired gas
exchange, as the fluid-filled air spaces in the lungs make it difficult for oxygen to pass from the air into the bloodstream. In severe cases, it can lead to respiratory failure and can be life-threatening. prompt recognition and management of fluid overload during hysteroscopic procedures are
crucial to minimizing the risk of complications like pulmonary edema.
Hysteroscopy is an operative procedure that provides the endoscopic view of endometrial cavity and tubal ostia via the cervix. It can be diagnostic or therapeutic. A hysteroscopic image of a
uterus with carcinoma is shown below.




complications of hysteroscopy include :
• Early complications:
• Anesthesia complications- air embolism can occur
• uterine perforation
• Thermal injury with cautery and laser
• sepsis
• Allergic reaction to dextran and glycine
• Fluid overload occurs and can lead to pulmonary edema if the fluid deficit is more than 1ooo
mL. It can be managed by diuretics.
• cerebral edema
• cardiac failure
• Late complications:
• Hematometra following cervical stenosis
• pelvic inflammatory disease
• uterine rupture during pregnancy
• Dysmenorrhea
• Amenorrhea
other options:
option A: Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a kidney disorder involving damage to the tubule cells of the kidneys, which can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI). while fluid overload can be a risk
factor for AKI, it is not the immediate complication of a fluid deficit of 2ooo mL in this clinical scenario.
option B: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIc) is a serious disorder where the proteins that control blood clotting become overactive. It is not directly related to a fluid deficit during a  hysteroscopic procedure and is therefore not the immediate complication in this case.
option D: Thromboembolism refers to a blood clot that forms in a blood vessel and then breaks     loose, traveling through the bloodstream and potentially causing a blockage in another part of the body.

Q14,A 54-year-old woman was diagnosed with advanced cervical cancer. she has a 14-year-old daughter. what advice would you give her daughter?,"a)Advise HPV vaccine
b)screen for BRcA mutation
c)screen for PTEN mutation
d)Perform cervical biopsy","The patient's 14-year-old daughter should be advised to take the HPV vaccine.
The patient's daughter is not at a higher risk for developing cervical cancer because it does not run in families. The etiology of cervical cancer is related to human papilloma virus (HPV) infection,
and immunization against the virus is protective.
There are three types of available HPV vaccines, Cervarix, Gardasil, and Gardasil-9.
option 2: BRCA mutation causes breast cancer, it is not related to cervical cancer.
option 3: PTEN mutation on chromosome 1o causes Cowden syndrome.
option 4: Cervical biopsy is not indicated in this scenario.

Q15,"A 17-year-old girl is seen for primary amenorrhea. There is no development of breasts or hair  in the pubic or axillary region. Her height is 155 cm and her weight is 48 kg. she has bilateral inguinal masses. on ultrasound examination, the uterus, fallopian tube, and ovary are absent. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)complete androgen insensitivity syndrome
b)Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism
c)Turner syndrome
d)Polycystic ovary syndrome","The diagnosis based on the given clinical scenario is hypergonadotropic hypogonadism.
The clinical scenario mentions a female with primary amenorrhea with bilateral inguinal masses (undescended testis) and absent ovary pointing to the possibility of Xy karyotype. Absent uterus and fallopian tubes point to the presence of a Mullerian inhibiting substance.
Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism can occur in disorders such as FSH or LH receptor     mutations. Leydig cell hypoplasia is an autosomal recessive 46, Xy disorder. It is caused by inactivating mutations in the LH/hCG receptor that prevents normal hormone



binding. The decrease in the number or function of Leydig cells decreases fetal testosterone production. This leads to the failure of normal male sexual differentiation.
In patients presenting with LH receptor defects, the action of the anti-mullerian hormone is
normal; hence, the derivatives of the Mullerian duct are absent. Due to decreased testosterone production, wolffian duct development is impaired and the testes fail to descend. They
appear female at birth and at puberty present with primary amenorrhea. They lack breast development and pubic hair development.
other options:
option A: Androgen insensitivity syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder in which
the androgen receptors are absent, scanty, or fail to respond to testosterone. In complete AIs, the individual is born as a phenotypically normal female but generally presents with primary
amenorrhea. The external genitalia appears normal, with absent or scant pubic and axillary
hair. The vagina is shortened and blind-ending with an absent uterus and ovaries. These patients   may also present with a history of childhood inguinal hernias, due to the presence of undescended testis in the abdomen or in the inguinal canal. Due to the constant conversion of testosterone into estrogen, these individuals have normal breast development.
option c: Turner's syndrome presents with a structural abnormality of the second X chromosome or has a mosaic karyotype, such as 45X/46 XX. The clinical features of Turner’s syndrome
include short stature, short and wide neck, broad chest, widely spaced nipples, primary
amenorrhea, congenital heart defects, and renal anomalies. Two X chromosomes are required for the development of ovaries. Losing one X chromosome results in streak ovaries and inadequate    estrogen production.
option D: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (Pcos) is the most common reproductive age group
endocrine disorder. Patients with Pcos present with menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, acne,   infertility, sleep apnea, and depression/anxiety. These are all short-term consequences of Pcos. The long-term consequences of Pcos include diabetes mellitus, endometrial cancer, and
cardiovascular disease.
According to American society of Reproductive Medicine (AsRM) and European society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (EsHRE), sonographic criteria for Pcos include
• &gt;2o follicles and/or,
• Increased ovarian volume (&gt;1o mL), or both",,B,
Q16,"A 16-year-old girl presents with cyclical pelvic pain every month. she has not achieved
menarche yet. on examination, a suprapubic bulge can be seen in the lower abdomen. PR examination reveals a bulging swelling in the anterior aspect. what is the most likely
diagnosis?","a)Transverse vaginal septum above the vagina
b)Vaginal atresia
c)Imperforate hymen
d)cervical agenesis","The given case scenario is suggestive of cryptomenorrhea due to an imperforate hymen.
cryptomenorrhea is a condition where menstruation occurs but is not visible due to
an obstruction of the outflow tract. The menstrual fluid gets collected in the reproductive tract.
Imperforate hymen is a urogenital anomaly. Imperforate hymen results due to failure of
canalization of the inferior end of the vaginal plate. This anomaly usually remains unrecognized     until puberty. It can lead to mucocolpos in early infancy. Patients present with amenorrhea, cyclic abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, and a hypogastric lump on abdominal examination. A bluish   bulging membrane at the vaginal opening is noted on genital examination and the valsalva




maneuver.
ultrasound of the pelvis reveals normal internal genitalia and hematocolpos. Laparoscopy should be performed along with hymenectomy to exclude endometriosis.
Most common causes of cryptomenorrhea:
• Intact/imperforate hymen - a bluish convex bulge is seen
• Transverse vaginal septum - a pinkish concave covering is seen
ultrasound pelvis confirms the diagnosis. A simple cruciate incision of the hymen allows the free drainage of the collected menstrual blood and restores the reproductive capacity in most cases.
other options:
option A: Transverse vaginal septum occurs due to the failure of Müllerian duct fusion or failure of vaginal plate canalization. on examination, the vagina may appear shortened and the cervix     may not be identifiable. secondary sexual characteristics appear normal. The diagnosis can be
confirmed with ultrasound or MRI.
option B: vaginal atresia is characterized by the absence of the lower portion of the vagina with well-differentiated superior structures like the uterus. on examination, the hymenal ring is
normal, proximal to which only a vaginal dimple or small pouch is found.
option D: cervical agenesis is the congenital absence of the cervix typically with a normal uterus. These patients also lack the upper vagina in most cases. They present with primary amenorrhea    and cyclic pelvic pain. If a functional endometrium is present, a patient may have a distended
uterus, and endometriosis may develop. The absence of a cervix is seen on examination.",,C,
Q17,A pregnant woman comes to the clinic. she already has twins by normal delivery. which of the following is the correct representation of her obstetric score?,"a)G3P2
b)G3P1
c)G2P1
d)G2P2","The obstetric score of a pregnant woman who previously delivered twins would be G2p1.
The obstetric score is used to summarize the past obstetric history as follows:
• G - Gravidity, denoting the total number of pregnancies, including the present one. It is irrespective of the period of gestation.
• p - parity, denoting the total number of previous pregnancies crossing the period
of viability, which is 28 weeks in India.
• This includes both live births and stillbirths
• The current pregnancy is not included
• A - Abortus or the number of pregnancies that were lost for any reason, including induced abortions or miscarriages.
• L - Living children
Both Gravida and para are the numbers of pregnancies rather than babies.
Terminology
• Nulligravida: one who is not and has never been pregnant
• primigravida: one who is pregnant for the first time



• Multigravida: one who has previously been pregnant
• Nullipara: one who has never completed a pregnancy to the stage of viability
• primipara: one who has delivered only once (fetuses born alive or dead after becoming viable)
• Multipara: one with 2 or more pregnancies to the stage of viability or more
• parturient: A woman in labor",,C,
Q18,"A woman presents to you at 36 weeks of gestation with complaints of feeling lightheadedness and dizziness when she lies on her back. she says she feels alright if she lies on her side or
when walks. what is the most likely reason behind this?","a)Increased intracranial pressure
b)IVC compression
c)Heavy meals
d)Excessive venous pooling at the feet","The most likely reason a woman at 36 weeks of gestation complains of feeling lightheadedness
and dizziness when she lies on her back but feels alright if she lies on her side or walks is inferior vena cava (IVC) compression.
when the patient is supine during late pregnancy, the gravid uterus has a compressive effect on
the IVC. This results in opening up collateral circulation through the means of paravertebral and azygos veins. However, in some cases, the collateral circulation is unable to open up, and the
heart's venous return may get severely impaired. syncope, tachycardia, and hypotension are
produced as a result. The patient is rapidly turned to a lateral posture to return the blood pressure to normal. This phenomenon is called supine hypotension syndrome (postural hypotension).
other options-
option A- Individuals with elevated intracranial pressure may experience papilledema along with neck stiffness and visual problems. several herniation syndromes can result from brain matter
being forced through the fixed cranial apertures as the mass grows.
option C- pregnant women are advised to avoid heavy meals and not to go to bed immediately
after the meal. They can cause heartburn, which is common in pregnancy due to the relaxation of the esophageal sphincter.
option D- The pressure in the femoral vein is noticeably increased, especially in the later
months. The gravid uterus puts pressure on the common iliac veins, particularly on the right side due to the dextrorotation of the uterus. In a lying down position during pregnancy, the femoral
venous pressure increases from 8 to 1o cm of water to around 25 cm of water, and in a standing position, it increases to approximately 8o to 1oo cm of water. This excessive pooling of blood in
the lower limbs explains physiological edema during pregnancy. Edema, varicose veins, piles, and  deep vein thrombosis are all caused by the extensibility of the veins and blood stasis in the venous system.",,B,
