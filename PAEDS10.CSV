Q1,"In neonatal resuscitation, which of the following is the most effective indicator of successful ventilatory effort?","a)colour change
b)Rise in heart rate
c)Air entry
d)chest rise","An increase in the heart rate is the most effective indicator of successful ventilatory effort. The response to neonatal resuscitation at various steps is assessed based on the heart rate.
As soon as a baby is born, the tone, cry, breathing efforts, and respiratory efforts are assessed. If the tone is poor, or if the baby is not breathing, the following measures are done immediately -
warming to maintain the normal temperature, proper positioning of the baby's airway, i.e. sniffing position with the head slightly extended, clearing of airway secretions, and tactile stimulation.
After the initial steps of neonatal resuscitation, the heart rate of the baby must be assessed. If the heart rate is &lt; 1oo beats per minute (bpm), positive pressure ventilation is provided along
with Spo2 monitoring to ensure adequate ventilation.
If the heart rate remains at &lt; 1oo bpm, ventilation corrective steps
and/or endotracheal intubation have to be considered. The ventilation corrective steps are as follows and can be remembered with the mnemonic MRSopA.
• Mask has to be reapplied
• Reposition head
• Suction the secretions
• open mouth slightly and ventilate
• pressure is increased slightly
• Airway may be changed
If the heart rate is &lt; 6o bpm, chest compressions are initiated over the lower third of the     sternum at a rate of 9o compressions/min. The ratio of compressions to ventilation is 3: 1 (9o compressions: 3o breaths).
If the heart rate still remains &lt;6o bpm, despite effective compressions and ventilation, then   epinephrine (1:1o,ooo solution at o.1–o.3 mL/kg intravenously or o.5–1 mL/kg intratracheally)  should be administered. The dosage can be repeated every 3–5 minutes. persistent bradycardia may signify inadequate ventilation or severe cardiac compromise.

Q2,which can be used as an alternative to mother's milk in a low birth weight (LBw) baby?,"a)cow's milk
b)preterm formula
c)Term formula
d)Human donor milk","Human donor milk is the best alternative to mother's milk for low birth weight (LBW) babies.
It is recommended that all LBW babies are exclusively fed breast milk regardless of the feeding
method. This can be achieved through the use of expressed breast milk (EBM) from the mother or human donor milk.
Donor milk offers advantages over preterm formula, such as reduced risk of necrotizing
enterocolitis (NEC) and feeding intolerance. However, due to lower protein and micronutrient levels in donor milk, human milk fortifiers should be added to meet the nutritional needs of    infants.
In cases where breastfeeding is not feasible or the mother is ill, formula feeds can be utilized.
Term formula feed (option C) is suitable for infants weighing over 15oo grams at birth, while preterm formula feed (option B) is recommended for very low birth weight infants.
Cow milk (option A) is not preferred as it lacks essential nutrients such as vitamin C, iron, and      essential fatty acids. Additionally, its high protein and lactose content can lead to digestive issues and allergic reactions in infants.
once the mother's condition stabilizes or breastfeeding contraindications are resolved, exclusive breastfeeding should be resumed.
The mode of nutrition of LBW depends on their gestational age. Babies born before 28 weeks of gestation receive total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Enteral feeding is not initiated at this stage as the gastrointestinal tract is not fully developed.
Babies born between 28 and 32 weeks of gestation may exhibit suckling bursts but their
coordination of suckling, swallowing, and breathing is not fully developed. Hence, EBM given orally may result in aspiration. EBM is administered through a nasogastric tube or orogastric  tube.
As gestational age advances to 32-34 weeks, the coordination of feeding improves, and EBM can be given with a paladai or katori spoon.
For babies born after 34 weeks of gestation, with fully developed coordination, direct
breastfeeding is possible.",,D,
Q3,"A 4-year-old male child with a body weight of 15kg and height of 1oocm is admitted with
renal failure. His blood urea was 1oo mg/dL and serum creatinine was 1 mg/dL. what is the closest calculated eGFR in the patient?","a)33 ml/min/1.73 m2 BSA
b)4o ml/min/1.73 m2 BSA
c)55 ml/min/1.73 m2 BSA
d)8o ml/min/1.73 m2 BSA","eGFR in the 4-year-old child calculated by the modified schwartz formula is 4o ml/min/1.73 m2 body surface area (BsA).
The modified schwartz formula is the most commonly used formula in the pediatric age group to   estimate creatinine clearance in acute settings. It is based on serum creatinine, patient height, and an empirical constant k. The k value in the modified schwartz formula is o.413 for ages 1-17 years. This formula has higher accuracy and precision compared to the original schwartz formula.
eGFR 〓 o.413 x height (cm) / serum creatinine (mg/dL)



In the given scenario, the height of the patient is 1oo cm and serum creatinine is 1mg/dL.
Therefore, the closest eGFR is 4o mL/min/1.73 m2 BSA.
eGFR in adults is calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation or   the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. The calculation is      based on age and serum creatinine with specific modifications in females and African Americans.  Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a measure of kidney function. It can be estimated accurately by quantitating the clearance of a substance filtered across the capillaries but the substance should
not be absorbed nor secreted by tubules.
GFR can be estimated by intravenous injection of radioisotope technetium diethylene triamine pentaacetate (Tc-99m DTPA), but it is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore eGFR is
estimated by the clearance of creatinine.",,B,
Q4,Adrenocorticotropic hormone is the drug of choice in which of the following conditions?,"a)Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy
b)Rolandic epilepsy
c)west syndrome
d)Lennox Gastaut syndrome","Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is the drug of choice in west syndrome.
west syndrome is a severe generalized epilepsy that begins between the ages of 2 and 12 months. It is characterized by a triad of infantile spasms that occur in clusters, developmental regression,  and hypsarrhythmia on electroencephalogram (EEG). Hypsarrhythmia refers to a high voltage,     slow, chaotic background with multifocal spikes (shown below).


Cryptogenic cases (unknown etiology) have normal development prior to onset, while
symptomatic west syndrome is associated with preceding developmental delay owing to perinatal encephalopathies, metabolic disorders, or malformations.
Hormonal therapy, such as ACTH injections or oral steroids, is the preferred treatment for west    syndrome. The patient's response is monitored through awake and asleep EEGs conducted at 1, 2, and 4th weeks of starting hormonal therapy. Side effects may include hypertension, electrolyte
imbalance, infections, hyperglycemia and/or glycosuria, and gastric ulcers.



Vigabatrin is a first-line treatment option for infantile spasms in patients with tuberous sclerosis and is also considered a second-line choice if hormonal therapy has been unsuccessful in other    cases of infantile spasms.
The ketogenic diet is considered a third-line therapy for infantile spasms. other alternative
treatment options for spasms include valproate, benzodiazepines (such as nitrazepam and
clonazepam), topiramate, lamotrigine, zonisamide, pyridoxine, and intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG).
other options:
option A: Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME)/ Janz syndrome starts in early adolescence and is characterized by myoclonic jerks in the morning. EEG shows generalized irregular 4- to 6-Hz
spike-and-wave activity, particularly after awakening. Valproate is considered the most effective medication. Lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and topiramate are also approved for JME.
option B: Rolandic epilepsy is benign epilepsy seen in children. They present at night or while awakening. They are partial seizures with no loss of consciousness. They resolve in adulthood.
Treatment with carbamazepine is useful.
option D: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is seen in 2-1o years and is characterized by a triad of
developmental delay, multiple seizures (atypical absences, myoclonic, astatic, and tonic seizures), and specific EEG changes (1 to 2 Hz spike and slow waves, polyspike bursts). Treatment with
topiramate, clobazam, felbamate, lamotrigine, and valproate is useful.",,C,5655-3598.PNG
Q5,"Regarding urinary tract infection (UTI ) in children, which of the following is true?","a)1,3,4
b)2,4
c)2,3,4
d)1,4","The true statements regarding UTI in children are bowel and bladder dysfunction increases the   risk of recurrence, and micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) is done in children with recurrence of UTI.
The chief cause of UTI in children is Escherichia coli, others include klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Risk factors for recurrent UTI are age &lt;6 months, obstructive
uropathy, female sex, vesicoureteric reflux (VUR), bladder dysfunction, constipation, and repeated catheterization.
Clinical features in neonates include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, poor weight gain, and lethargy. If the child cries during voiding or has a weak urine stream with a palpable bladder, it implies
urinary obstruction. High fever (&gt;39oC), persistent vomiting, dehydration, renal angle tenderness, or raised creatinine is considered a complicated UTI.
A colony count of &gt;1o5/mL of a clean catch sample is considered significant bacteriuria. Any    colonies on suprapubic aspiration and &gt;5o,ooo/mL on urethral catheterization are considered significant. patients with recurrent UTIs need to be evaluated with ultrasonography, DMSA scan (dimercaptosuccinic acid), and MCU.
Evaluation following the first episode of UTI is given below:
Third-generation cephalosporins or aminoglycosides are preferred empirical antibiotics for
urinary tract infections (UTIs). Treatment duration is 7-1o days for simple UTIs and 1o-14 days for complicated UTIs. Asymptomatic bacteriuria doesn't require treatment. Infants &lt;3 months and  those with complicated UTIs should receive parenteral antibiotics.



Cotrimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, and cefadroxil are given as prophylaxis to prevent    recurrent UTIs. Cotrimoxazole and nitrofurantoin can be given in infants &gt;3 months of age.

Q8,"An 11-year-old boy was brought to the outpatient clinic with intentional tremors, and poor    scholastic performance. His sister has similar complaints. on examination, hepatomegaly is seen. The eye finding is shown in the image. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)wilson's disease
b)Huntington's chorea
c)Glutaric aciduria
d)Hepatitis A","The probable diagnosis in the given case, based on the given clinical scenario and the image which shows icterus in the eyes, is wilson's disease.
wilson's disease is an autosomal-recessive condition caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene,
which encodes for the ATPase that removes copper, preventing its accumulation in the liver and brain.



Clinical features are jaundice, ascites, hepatomegaly, dysarthria, dystonia, wing-beating tremor, a decline in school performance, and personality change. Deposition of copper in the lens results
in sunflower cataracts and Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring is seen due to the deposition of copper in Descemet’s membrane of the cornea.
Diagnosis is made by the presence of a KF ring and decreased levels of serum copper and
ceruloplasmin. Increased 24-hour urine copper excretion is seen. Measurement of hepatic copper levels in liver biopsy is the gold standard.
Treatment is the use of intramuscular British anti-lewisite or oral D-penicillamine. These drugs increase the excretion of copper in the urine. pyridoxine is given concomitantly. Trientine
hydrochloride is a suitable alternative to those intolerant to penicillamine.
zinc acetate helps in copper absorption. It is used in presymptomatic patients, pregnant women, and as maintenance therapy. Liver transplantation is considered in advanced stages.
other options:
option B: Huntington's chorea is a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat disorder with an autosomal
dominant mode of inheritance. It is characterized by involuntary movements known as chorea.
option C: Glutaric aciduria is an autosomal recessive disease presenting during the first 6 months of life. Clinical features are hypotonia and jitteriness at birth, progressive hyperkinetic movements (dystonia, choreoathetosis), and may have seizures
option D: Hepatitis A is a viral infection transmitted by the fecal-oral route, which is the
commonest, parenteral route, and also by sexual transmission. The onset of jaundice is preceded  by symptoms like nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and mild fever. Hepatitis A resolves completely but a relapse may occur in a few cases.",5647-3595.PNG,A,
Q9,which alternative method can be used for the procedure shown in the image below?,"a)Head circumference
b)Arm span
c)crown-rump length
d)knee height","The procedure shown in the image is the measurement of the height of a child using a
stadiometer. The alternative method that can be used for the procedure is arm span. The proportion of arm span changes with age but is close to height.
For children older than 2 years of age, a stadiometer is used to measure their height. It is
measured with the head in the Frankfurt plane, and the back of the head, thorax, buttocks, and heels all on the same axis as that of the stadiometer.
Arm span provides an assessment of proportionality. It is measured by asking the child to stand, the back against the wall with arms outstretched, and the distance between the tip of the middle  fingers are measured.
The body proportion in a child is assessed by the ratio of the upper segment (uS) and lower segment (LS) and by comparing the arm span with height.
upper segment: Lower segment ratio
A higher uS:LS ratio is associated with bone disorders and conditions involving short-limb   dwarfism, such as Turner syndrome, whereas a lower ratio is associated with hypogonadism and Marfan syndrome.
other options:



option-A: Head circumference is measured as the maximal circumference along the supraorbital ridge in the front and the occipital prominence at the back of the head. It is measured using a
flexible tape. It reflects the brain growth in a child.
option-c: crown-rump length is used for the assessment of fetal growth as early as 6–8 weeks of gestation. This length is used to determine the gestational age in the first trimester.
option-D: knee height is the distance from the sole of the foot to the anterior surface of the
femoral condyle, with the ankle and knee flexed to right angles. It is used when standing height cannot be measured.

Q10,A child presents with acute exacerbation of asthma. which of the following would you do?,"a)3,4
b)1,4
c)1,3,4
d)2,3,4","A child coming with acute exacerbation of asthma will be administered oxygen, salbutamol nebulization three times in 6o minutes, and oral corticosteroids.
Exacerbation of asthma is known as an increase in symptoms such as cough, wheezing, and/or    breathlessness. If the child has cyanosis, silent chest, poor respiratory effort, altered sensorium, and oxygen saturation of &lt;9o%, the exacerbation is considered life-threatening.
Based on the severity, acute asthma is classified as mild, moderate, and severe.
Home treatment for acute exacerbation involves parents administering short-acting,
beta-2-agonists by metered-dose inhaler with/without a spacer and facemask. one puff for every 3o–6o seconds up to a maximum of 1o puffs with monitoring. If symptoms are relieved after
inhalation, the child can continue salbutamol inhalation every 4–6 hours. If there is no
improvement or partial improvement, the child should be transferred to a hospital.
In a child presenting to the hospital with severe symptoms, start inhalation
of oxygen, short-acting beta-2-agonists such as salbutamol or albuterol that can be used every
15–2o minutes for the first hour and administer oral prednisolone (1–2 mg/kg). oxygen inhalation is stopped if an oxygen saturation of &gt;95% cannot be maintained.

Q11,"A young man is brought to the hospital with high-grade fever and altered consciousness. on examination, the patient had neck rigidity and pain when bending the neck. A lumbar
puncture was performed and it showed a wBc count of 15oo cells/μL, majority being
neutrophils, elevated pressure with protein of 12o mg/dL, and a glucose level of 7o mg/dL (blood glucose level - 3oo mg/dL). How will you manage the index case?","a)piperacillin+ tazobactum
b)Amphotericin + flucytosine
c)vancomycin+ ceftriaxone
d)Antitubercular therapy","The given clinical scenario with high fever, altered consciousness, neck rigidity, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showing neutrophilic pleocytosis with low sugar point toward a diagnosis of bacterial   meningitis. The initial treatment involves the administration of 3rd-generation cephalosporin like ceftriaxone along with vancomycin for 1o–14 days.
Hyperglycemia due to the pathological stress from the infection can mask the reduced CSF glucose. It can be correctly inferred from CSF/blood glucose ratio. A ratio &lt;o.4 is highly   significant for bacterial meningitis.
The most common cause of meningitis in adults over 2o years of age is Streptococcus
pneumoniae.
The classic clinical triad of meningitis includes fever, headache, and nuchal rigidity. other
common symptoms include decreased consciousness, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and
seizures. Cutaneous signs such as petechiae, purpura, or an erythematous macular rash may be present.
kernig's sign and Brudzinski's sign can indicate meningeal irritation. kernig's sign is positive when there is resistance and pain in extending the knee with the hip flexed at 9o degrees.
Brudzinski's sign is positive when there is involuntary flexion of the hips and knees in response to passive neck flexion. However, these signs may not be reliable in certain patient groups, such as    infants, elderly individuals, or those with altered mental status.
when bacterial meningitis is suspected, blood cultures should be obtained, and empirical
antimicrobial therapy should be initiated without delay. The diagnosis is confirmed by examining  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF analysis shows increased polymorphonuclear leukocytes, decreased glucose concentration, increased protein concentration, and increased opening pressure. CSF
bacterial cultures and Gram stain are used to identify the causative organism.
prompt initiation of empirical antimicrobial therapy is crucial in suspected cases of bacterial
meningitis. Commonly used antibiotics include third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins (such as ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or cefepime) that cover Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria
meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae and vancomycin if there is a high suspicion of
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. Ampicillin with metronidazole is added when Listeria monocytogenes is suspected, particularly in neonates, pregnant women,
individuals over 5o years, and immunocompromised individuals.",,C,
Q12,which of the following increase the risk of recurrence of febrile seizures?,"a)1,2,4
b)1,4
c)1,2,3
d)1,3,4","Age &lt;1 year, temperature of 38–39°C (1oo.4-1o2.2ºF), and fever duration of &lt;24 h (statement
1,2,3) are the major risk factors for the recurrence of febrile seizures.



Minor risk factors include a family history of epilepsy, male gender, daycare, complex febrile    seizure, family history of febrile seizures, and lower serum sodium at the time of presentation.
Febrile seizures occur in children of the age of 6–6o months (peak at 12 to 18 months) with a temperature of 38ºc (1oo.4°F) or higher, without underlying intracranial infections or prior   unprovoked seizures.
Types of febrile seizures:
Lumbar puncture should be performed in the first episode of seizures with fever, for all
infants &lt;6 months of age (to exclude meningitis). Electroencephalogram and neuroimaging are advised for children with suspected epilepsy or neurological abnormalities.
Treatment with lorazepam, diazepam, and midazolam for seizures lasting more than 5
minutes. Rectal diazepam is prescribed to use at home as rescue medication if febrile seizures last more than 5 minutes. Buccal or intranasal midazolam may be used alternatively.
For frequently recurring febrile seizures, intermittent oral clonazepam or diazepam can be given during febrile illnesses to reduce the risk of recurrence. continuous prophylaxis is no longer
recommended.
Antipyretics can be given but it does not decrease the risk of recurrence. chronic antiepileptic therapy may be considered for children at high risk of developing epilepsy. screening for and  treating iron deficiency is recommended as it is associated with an increased risk of febrile

The mousy or musty odor of urine in phenylketonuria (pku) is due to the accumulation of phenylalanine metabolites including phenylpyruvate, phenylacetate, and phenyl lactate.
pku can lead to low levels of tyrosine, which is synthesized from phenylalanine. Tyrosine gives
rise to catecholamines like dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Thus, low levels of
tyrosine may lead to a deficiency of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. However, this is not the reason for the mousy odor of urine.



Pku is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (classic Pku) or defects in the enzymes involved in producing tetrahydrobiopterin. These deficiencies impair the conversion   of phenylalanine to tyrosine, leading to elevated levels of phenylalanine and low levels of tyrosine  in the body. The excess phenylalanine in the blood is metabolized to phenyl ketones
(phenylpyruvate and phenylacetate) which are excreted in the urine.
Affected infants initially appear normal at birth. If left untreated, they gradually develop profound intellectual disability. older untreated children may exhibit hyperactivity, autistic behaviors, and   neurologic signs such as seizures, spasticity, and tremors. Abnormalities like microcephaly,
prominent maxillae, and growth retardation are seen. They are also prone to low bone mineral density and osteopenia.
untreated Pku patients may exhibit hypopigmentation (fair hair, light skin color, and blue eyes) due to low levels of tyrosine, which is necessary for the formation of melanin pigment.
If a woman with Pku is not following a low-phenylalanine diet during pregnancy, it can lead to maternal Pku syndrome in the offspring. This condition is associated with microcephaly and     congenital heart disease.
The preferred screening method is tandem mass spectrometry. If screening is positive, the diagnosis is confirmed by quantitatively measuring phenylalanine levels.
The primary treatment for Pku is a low-phenylalanine diet, which should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is established. Lifelong restriction of dietary phenylalanine is recommended.
Tyrosine becomes an essential amino acid in Pku and it needs to be obtained from the diet.
The series of reactions involving the production of catecholamines is shown in the image below:",,C,5662-3599.PNG
Q14,"A child is brought to the casualty with a history of choking. on examination, there is decreased air entry in the left lung. what would be the correct management?","a)1, 2, and 4
b)1 and 2
c)3 and 4
d)1 and 4","A history of choking and reduced breath sounds over the left lung in a child are suggestive of a foreign body lodged in the left bronchus. The next step in the management of this child is to
obtain a chest x-ray, followed by bronchoscopic removal of the foreign body.



Food items (nuts, seeds hard candy, gum, bones raw fruits, and vegetables) account for the   majority of choking cases in children. The most common site of foreign body lodging is the   bronchus. Foreign body aspiration into the airway has three stages: immediate symptoms of coughing and choking, an asymptomatic interval, and later complications such as fever,
atelectasis, and pneumonia.
when a child presents with a history of choking, detailed history taking and physical examination of the nose, oral cavity, pharynx, neck, and lungs are necessary.
The next step for suspected foreign body aspiration is to obtain a chest X-ray, including the
abdomen, despite most foreign bodies being radiolucent. secondary findings on the X-ray can
indicate foreign body involvement, such as air trapping, atelectasis, obstructive emphysema,
asymmetric hyperinflation, mediastinal shift, or consolidation. while a CT scan has high accuracy, it is not typically performed due to radiation risks.
The treatment of choice for a foreign body in the airway is its endoscopic removal with a rigid instrument, usually a bronchoscope, by a specialist otolaryngologist or pulmonologist.
Bronchoscopy must be performed even if there is a high suspicion of an airway foreign body in spite of negative or inconclusive imaging.",,D,
Q15,A 9-month-old boy presents with progressive pallor and abdominal distension. The Mentzer index was found to be less than 13. what are the investigations to be done in this patient?,"a)1, and 2
b)1, 3, and 4
c)1 and 4
d)1, 2, 3, and 4","The investigations to be done in this patient are HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) and peripheral smear
The clinical history of a child with pallor, Mentzer's index &lt;13, and abdominal distention (suggestive of hepatosplenomegaly) is suggestive of thalassemia.
Peripheral smear shows hypochromic microcytic anemia, target cells, basophilic stippling, fragmented red cells, and nucleated RBCs. HPLC showing decreased levels of HbA and
an increase in HbA2 and HbF levels is sufficient to make a diagnosis.
The Mentzer index is the ratio of MCV (mean corpuscular volume) to RBC count. It is used to differentiate between iron-deficiency anemia and β-thalassemia trait. MCV and MCH (mean    corpuscular hemoglobin) are low in both IDA and thalassemia. RBC count may
be normal in thalassemia, whereas it is reduced in IDA. The Mentzer index is &lt;13 in
thalassemia minor syndrome.





Bone marrow examination (option 3) and coagulation studies (option 2) have no role in the diagnosis of thalassemia.
Thalassemia is a hemoglobinopathy that arises due to deficient synthesis of the globin chains. Depending on the chain affected, it is classified into α-thalassemia and β-thalassemia.
There is a deficit in the synthesis of HbA with an elevation of HbA2 and HbF levels in
β-thalassemia. Children with severe thalassemia present with facial features (shown below) such as maxilla hyperplasia, a flat nasal bridge, and frontal bossing. other manifestations include
pathologic bone fractures, significant hepatosplenomegaly, and cachexia.


Hb Electrophoresis and HPLC are used as screening tests for thalassemia. DNA diagnosis to
detect β-thalassemia mutations is used for definitive diagnosis. A radiographic image of the skull shows the classic 'crew cut' appearance.
Blood transfusions are administered every 3-4 weeks to maintain a pretransfusion hemoglobin level of 9.5-1o.5 g/dL. oral iron chelation to prevent iron toxicity is also recommended.



Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only definitive therapy.
Antenatal counseling and heterozygote screening can be used in the prevention of the condition. α-thalassemia is caused by deficient synthesis of α-chains. Deletion or malfunction of
three α-globin chains can result in HbH disease. Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis is due to the absence of any normally functioning α-globin genes.",,C,5662-3599-1.png;5566-3549.PNG
Q16,"A child presents with complaints of fever, rash, body ache, and throat ache. He has a history of thorn prick injury a week back. what antibiotics would you give empirically to this child?","a)ceftriaxone
b)Amoxicillin+ clavulanate
c)vancomycin
d)Meropenem","A child with a history of fever with rash and throat ache (sore throat) following a thorn prick
injury could be having scarlet fever caused by group A Streptococcus (GAS). This child could be treated empirically with amoxicillin-clavulanate.
GAS commonly presents in children with pharyngitis and rash. It commonly spreads through  droplets but can also be inoculated by a wound (thorn prick in this case) or burn infected with GAS.
The rash typically begins as diffuse, erythematous, papular eruptions. Sandpaper rash and the   strawberry tongue are characteristic lesions that develop in the course of the disease. pyrogenic exotoxin (erythrogenic exotoxin) produced by Group A Streptococcus is responsible for scarlet   fever.
Streptococcal rapid antigen detection test or throat culture should be done before starting treatment with antibiotics. First-line treatment is by penicillin or amoxicillin for 1o days.
Clavulanate can be added to combat any beta-lactamases produced by the bacteria.",,B,
Q17,A child with thalassemia is undergoing multiple blood transfusions. what is the best method to detect iron overload?,"a)Liver iron concentration
b)MRI T2 myocardium
c)serum ferritin
d)NTBI","The best method to assess iron overload is quantitative liver iron using T2 MRI. It eliminates the need for invasive procedures like liver biopsy.
Excessive iron stores resulting from transfusions are a major concern in the management of β-thalassemia major. Accurate assessment of iron overload is crucial for optimal treatment.
Quantitative measurement of cardiac iron by T2 MRI (option B) is initiated at the age of 1o.
However, there can be a discrepancy between liver iron and cardiac iron levels due to variations in tissue loading and unloading rates.
while serial serum ferritin levels (option C) can be used as a screening tool, they may not     accurately reflect quantitative iron stores. Relying solely on serum ferritin levels can lead to undertreatment or overtreatment of iron overload.
Normally, iron in the plasma is bound to transferrin. But in iron-overload conditions, iron exceeds the iron binding capacity leading to the appearance of non-transferrin-bound iron (option D). It     can act as an indicator of iron overload, but it is influenced by plasma factors like citrate, uric
acid, and albumin. Hence, it cannot be used as a tool to measure quantitative iron overload that can help guide in planning chelation therapies.



other tests that help calculate iron overload include echocardiography, bone mass densitometry, and testing for endocrinopathy. These tests are done at the time of diagnosis and done yearly to  monitor iron overload. Serum ferritin tests can be done every 3 months.
Hypothyroidism, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, growth hormone deficiency,
hypoparathyroidism, and diabetes mellitus are seen due to iron deposition in endocrine organs.  Iron deposition in the heart can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac-related mortality. Iron chelation therapy is recommended when serum ferritin levels exceed 1,ooo ng/mL and/or     liver iron concentration is above 5,ooo μg/g dry weight. It is not approved for children under 2    years of age. Three iron chelators are available: deferoxamine, deferasirox, and deferiprone.
Deferoxamine is administered subcutaneously or intravenously due to its poor oral bioavailability. Deferasirox is a once-daily oral iron chelator. Deferiprone is an oral iron chelator approved as a
second-line agent.",,A,
Q18,How would you manage a child with status epilepticus?,"a)1, 2, 3, 4
b)2, 1, 4, 3
c)1, 3, 4, 2
d)1, 2, 4, 3","The order of management of a child with status epilepticus is airway and breathing→ iv lorazepam→IV Fosphenytoin→Midazolam, propofol, Thiopentone (1, 2, 4, 3)
For generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), status epilepticus (SE) is defined as continuous convulsive activity or recurrent generalized convulsive seizure activity without regaining
consciousness.
t1 is the time at which treatment should be initiated. t2 is the time at which continuous seizure activity leads to long-term sequelae such as neuronal injury.
The image given below depicts the management of status epilepticus in a flowchart:

Type of seizure	t1	t2
GTCS	5 min	3o m in
Focal seizures with impaired awareness	1o min	3o m in
Absence seizures	1o-15

own






Refractory status epilepticus (SE) refers to SE that does not respond to therapy involving at least two medications (such as benzodiazepine and another medication). Super refractory status
epilepticus is SE that does not resolve or recur within 24 hours or more despite treatment that involves continuous infusions of medications like midazolam or pentobarbital.",,D,5667-3600.PNG
Q19,"A child presents with cold feet and a history of wearing socks even in the summers. on
examination, lower limb pulses are diminished as compared to the radial pulse. prominent radio femoral delay is present. what is the underlying condition?","a)There is hypertrophy of ductus arteriosus.
b)coarctation distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery
c)supply is from posterior to anterior thoracic artery.
d)collaterals develop to supply upper limb.","The given clinical scenario of a child with cold feet with diminished lower limb pulses and radio femoral delay is suggestive of coarctation of the aorta. It is caused by coarctation distal to the
origin of the left subclavian artery.
coarctation of the aorta is a congenital heart disease, which involves constriction of the aorta at
any point from the transverse arch to the iliac bifurcation. In 98% of cases, there is a narrowing of the descending aorta, usually distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery at the origin of the
ductus arteriosus.
coarctation of the aorta can be classified into two types based on the location of constriction:
preductal (infantile type) and postductal (adult type). preductal coarctation occurs proximal to the ductus arteriosus, while postductal coarctation occurs distal to it.
clinical features include differences in blood pressure and pulse in the upper and lower
extremities, radio femoral delay, and prominent pulsations in the upper limb. cardiac
enlargement and pulmonary congestion are noted in infants with severe coarctation. During
childhood, the findings are present after the 1st decade. The heart is mildly or moderately
enlarged because of left ventricular prominence. The enlarged left subclavian artery typically
produces a prominent shadow in the left superior mediastinum. A continuous murmur over the infra-scapular region or the scapula can be auscultated.
The condition is associated with the bicuspid aortic valve, systemic hypertension, an aortic aneurysm, left ventricular hypertrophy, left heart failure, and premature atherosclerosis.



The figure of 3 sign refers to the indentation of the aorta at the coarctation site. There is pre and post-stenotic dilatation along with the left para-mediastinal shadow. Chest radiograph shows
notching of ribs and the figure of 3 sign:


unless surgically corrected in infancy, coarctation of the aorta results in the development of
collateral circulation, mainly from branches of the subclavian, superior intercostal, and internal mammary arteries, to create channels for arterial blood to bypass the area of coarctation.
Hypertrophy of the ductus arteriosus (option A) is not typically associated with coarctation of the  aorta as it closes shortly after birth and is not directly involved in coarctation. The blood supply to the upper limb is higher as the coarctation is distal to the origin of the subclavian artery, therefore collaterals do not develop to supply the upper limb (option D).",,B,5668-3601.PNG
Q20,An unconsious child is brought to the casualty. what is the correct sequence of the management?,"a)3-1-2-4-5
b)1-2-3-4-5
c)3-1-2-5-4
d)1-2-4-3-5","The correct sequence to provide basic life support is to assess responsiveness, check for
breathing and pulse, start bag and mask ventilation commence and then cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
In an unresponsive patient, ensure scene safety first, then check for responsiveness, and activate the emergency response. In the presence of two or more rescuers, one remains with the victim
while the other activates the emergency response system. Evaluate breathing and pulse within 1o seconds.
If the person does not have a pulse and is not breathing and there is only one rescuer, start CPR     immediately with cycles of 3o compressions and 2 breaths if it is not a witnessed collapse. If it is a witnessed collapse with one rescuer, activate the emergency response system (ERS) if not done
already, and retrieve the defibrillator.
After about 2 minutes, if still alone, activate the emergency response system and retrieve the
automated external defibrillator (AED). If there are 2 or more rescuers, then one should start CPR while the other retrieves AED. when the second rescuer arrives change the cycle to 2 breaths for



every 15 compressions. Breaths can be provided with the help of a bag and mask.
If the patient has a pulse but no normal breathing or only gasping, provide 1 breath every 3 to
5 seconds or about 12 to 2o breaths/min. Add compressions if pulse remains ≤6o/min with signs    of perfusion. Activate the emergency response system after 2 minutes. Continue rescue breathing, and check pulse every 2 minutes. If no pulse, start CPR.
when AED arrives, analyze the rhythm. If it is a shockable rhythm, give 1 shock. Resume CPR    immediately for about 2 minutes.  If it is a non-shockable rhythm, resume CPR immediately for about 2 minutes.

Q21,which of the following statements are true regarding cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection?,"a)3, 4
b)1, 2
c)2, 4
d)1, 3","The true statements regarding CMV infection are statements 1 and 3.
Most CMV transmission occurs in the first trimester. The risk of transmission is high in the third trimester.
only 1o% (statement 2) of the infected babies are symptomatic. Asymptomatic neonates have lesser chances of having late sequelae (statement 1).
Congenital CMV infection can result from either primary or reactivation infection of the mother.   The rate of transmission of infection to the fetus in a mother who has a primary infection is about 3o% (statement 3) while in a mother with a non-primary infection, it is 1-2%. However, the total   number of infants who have acquired an infection from a mother with a non-primary infection is   3-4 times more than infants who have acquired an infection from mothers with a primary
infection.
The clinical manifestations include
hepatosplenomegaly, petechial rashes, jaundice, chorioretinitis, and microcephaly. Neuroimaging shows intracranial periventricular calcifications. one of the long-term sequelae is sensorineural     hearing loss.



The investigation of choice is PCR or viral culture. It should be done within the first three weeks of life (statement 4). After this period, it is difficult to distinguish between a congenital and an
acquired infection. since not all affected infants are viremic at birth, urine and/or saliva are more reliable samples than blood.
There is no definitive treatment for congenital CMV infection. Treatment
with ganciclovir is indicated only in patients with progressive neurologic disease and deafness. Below is the image showing the blueberry muffin rash in CMV affected baby:",,D,5670-3603.PNG
Q22,The hormone that does not play a role in the growth of the fetus is:,"a)Insulin
b)Growth hormone
c)Thyroxine
d)Glucocorticoids","Growth hormone, despite being present at higher levels in the fetus, does not play a significant role in fetal growth.
The human fetus produces thyroxine from the 12th week of gestation. Thyroxine and insulin have an important role in regulating tissue growth and differentiation of the fetus, particularly during   late gestation. Glucocorticoids play an important role towards the end of gestation in
the prepartum maturation of organs such as the liver, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract.
Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and IGF-II also play an important role in fetal growth.",,B,
Q23,which of the following statements is true regarding the tape shown in the image?,"a)1, 3
b)2, 4
c)2, 3
d)1, 4","The tape shown in the image is shakir's tape. It is used to assess severe acute malnutrition (sAM). It is used by frontline field workers for nutritional screening of malnourished children and those    at risk, aged 6-59 months.
