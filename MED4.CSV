Q1,which of the following is the drug of choice for hairy cell leukemia?,"a)Rituximab
b)vemurafenib
c)cladribine
d)Interferon-alpha","cladribine is the drug of choice in hairy cell leukemia.
cladribine is a purine analogue with potent and curative activity against hairy cell leukemia.
other treatment options for hairy cell leukemia include deoxycoformycin, interferon-alpha, and splenectomy. chemotherapy-refractory patients are treated with vemurafenib, a BRAF kinase     inhibitor. The addition of rituximab results in more durable remissions.
cladribine is also used to treat cLL, low-grade lymphomas, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, and waldenstrδm macroglobulinemia.
The major dose-limiting toxicity of cladribine is myelosuppression.",,C,
Q2,"An intubated patient in the IcU had a chest X-ray taken to evaluate for fever spikes over the last 24-48 hours. The radiograph is shown below. what is the next best step in the
management of this patient?","a)suction the ET tube
b)chest physiotherapy twice daily
c)start antibiotics and send samples for culture
d)Ultrasound-guided aspiration","The given clinical history of an intubated IcU patient and the X-ray features point toward a
diagnosis of pleural effusion. Ultrasound-guided aspiration is the next step in the management of  the patient. Antibiotics should be started once the pleural tap has been done and infective etiology is suspected.
options A and B: ET tube suctioning and chest physiotherapy are done to remove thick secretions out of the upper and lower respiratory tract. It wouldn't help in removing the fluid of a pleural
effusion.
pleural effusion is a common finding in the IcU setting and in intubated patients. Many factors contribute to the impairment of pleural fluid turnover in such cases as prolonged recumbency,   ventilator-produced positive pressure, and reduced plasma oncotic pressure.
The diagnosis of pleural effusion may be made by clinical examination (dull note on percussion) or by imaging. A pleural tap for confirmation of diagnosis and to relieve breathing difficulty is     now done under ultrasound guidance.
The cXR features of pleural effusion include:
• obliteration of costophrenic angle on the side of pleural effusion
• Air-fluid interface (meniscus sign)
• Large effusions show: complete opacification of the lung, mediastinal shift, and tracheal deviation away from the effusion





Differential diagnosis in an intubated patient with opacities on CXR might be pneumonitis
secondary to gastric acid or food aspiration. But the X-ray would show patchy infiltration unlike the homogenous density seen in pleural effusion.",4173-2670.PNG,D,4185-2674.PNG
Q3,Following is a graphic representation of a patient admitted to the medicine ward with fever. what could be the possible diagnosis?,"a)cerebral malaria
b)Brucellosis
c)Leptospirosis
d)Typhoid","The given graphical representation of a biphasic illness (acute and convalescent phases) and relevant investigations at different stages of the disease is consistent with a diagnosis of
leptospirosis.
Malaria (option A) is commonly diagnosed by demonstrating malarial parasites in a peripheral blood smear and not in CSF or urine.
Brucellosis (option B) follows a characteristic pattern of undulating fever.
The mean incubation period in typhoid (option D) usually ranges from 1o to 14 days and diagnosed based on examination of blood or stool.
Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by gram-negative Leptospira bacteria (especially L.    interrogans). Direct transmission to humans occurs when broken skin and mucous membranes come into contact with the urine of infected reservoir hosts such as rodents.
Illness is classically biphasic after an incubation period of up to 1 month, though the distinction between the first and second phases is not always clear.
• Acute leptospiremic phase-organism can be cultured from blood (within 1 week of onset of symptoms)
• Resolving immune phase-organism can be cultured from urine (after 1 week)
Most cases are characterized by non-specific symptoms (e.g fever, headache, myalgia and
conjunctival suffusion) and resolve spontaneously within a week but a few may progress to a severe form known as weil's disease which typically presents with a triad of hemorrhage,
jaundice, and acute kidney injury.



Diagnosis includes:
• Dark-field microscopy of urine or blood samples
• serological tests
• Four-fold rise in the level of IgM titers within one month of the onset of symptoms
• Microscopic agglutination test (MAT)
• PcR
• culture on EMJH or Fletchers media Treatment:
• Mild disease: oral doxycycline or azithromycin or ampicillin/ amoxicillin
• severe disease: IV penicillin",4174-2671.PNG,C,
Q4,"The laboratory investigations of a 65 year old woman revealed a hemoglobin level of 5.4 g/dl, creatinine level of 6 mg/dl, calcium level of 12 mg/dl, potassium level of 4.4 mmol/L. Her
urine output in the last 24 hours was 5o ml. Bone marrow aspiration revealed more than 6o% of plasma cells. what would be the next appropriate line of management for this patient?","a)urgent consultation for dialysis
b)Lenalidomide + Bortezomib + Dexamethasone
c)Dexamethasone + fluids
d)chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation","The clinical scenario shows a patient with a bone marrow finding of plasma cells &gt;6o% which points to a diagnosis of multiple myeloma.
Anemia (Hb- 5.4 g/dl), hypercalcemia (serum calcium-12 mg/dl) and acute kidney injury
(creatinine-6 mg/dl, reduced urine output) are myeloma-defining events suggesting end-organ damage.
The most appropriate next step in managing this patient would be to administer fluids to treat the acute kidney injury and hypercalcemia (hypercalcemia is the most common cause of renal failure   in multiple myeloma), and prevent further renal impairment. Therefore, among the given options, dexamethasone and fuids would be the best answer.
Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma cell dyscrasia and its diagnosis requires bone marrow biopsy finding of ≥ 1o% clonal bone marrow plasma cells, a serum/urine M component, and at  least one of the myeloma-defining events (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia and bone lesions).
Dialysis (option A) is indicated in the following conditions:
• Pulmonary edema not responding to diuretics
• uremic pericarditis, uremic encephalopathy or uremic syndrome
• Metabolic acidosis not responding to treatment
• Hyperkalemia
Lenalidomide + Bortezomib + Dexamethasone (option B) is the preferred treatment in multiple myeloma and can be initiated after initial management of acute kidney injury.
chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (option D) in transplant-eligible patients prolongs overall survival in multiple myeloma patients.",,C,4187-2675.PNG
Q5,A diabetic nephropathy patient is an ideal candidate for renal graft transplant. which of the following statements is true?,"a)The survival rate of graft is 95% in the first year
b)The transplantation is cost effective after the second transplant year
c)The life expectancy is doubled in a diabetic patient with renal transplant
d)The treatment of chronic rejection has improved over the last 1o years","Transplantation becomes cost-effective after the second transplant year in a patient with diabetic nephropathy, provided there is no chronic rejection.
The cost of transplantation after the second year becomes lesser compared to thrice-weekly dialysis.
other options:
options A: Graft survival in the first year is not 95%. It is around 8o%
option C: The life expectancy is not doubled in a patient with diabetic nephropathy
post-transplantation
option D: As chronic rejection is due to so many variables, the treatment is very difficult. Risk   factors that predispose a recipient to long-term graft rejection include HLA-mismatching, acute episodes of graft rejection, mismatch in donor-recipient age, and smoking. Better treatment
options are still under research.",,B,
Q6,"A diabetic patient enters the OPD and greets you with a namaste. As the doctor, you notice a  deformity in his hand which is shown in the image below. Based on your observation, what is the likely cause of this deformity?","a)Flexor tenosynovitis
b)cheiroarthropathy
c)Dupuytrens contracture
d)Ankyloses","The image shows a positive namaste or prayer sign where the patient is unable to touch the palmar aspects of both hands and fingers together which is suggestive of diabetic
cheiroarthropathy.
Diabetic cheiroarthropathy also known as diabetic stiff hand syndrome is a cutaneous condition   characterized by waxy, thickened skin and limited joint mobility of the hands and fingers leading to flexion contractures (namaste or prayer sign). This occurs due to the non-enzymatic
glycosylation of collagen. It is seen in both diabetes type 1 and type 2. Its prevalence increases with age and poor glycemic control.



other options:
option A: Flexor tenosynovitis refers to inflammation of the sheath surrounding the flexor
tendons in the hand. Infectious flexor tenosynovitis is associated with the kanavel’s signs which include:
• Fusiform swelling along the affected finger
• Tenderness with palpation along the tendon sheath
• Flexed posture of the affected finger
• pain with passive extension
option C: Dupuytren's contracture is a fibroproliferative disorder affecting the palmar
aponeurosis of mainly the 4th and 5th fingers. skin puckering proximal to the flexor crease is the earliest sign, followed by the development of nodules and cords in the palmar fascia, leading to     flexion contractures at the MCp and pIp joints as the disease progresses.


option D: Ankylosis refers to the fusion of a joint, resulting in limited or no movement. It can occur due to various causes such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, trauma, or infection.",4175-2672.PNG,B,4188-2676.PNG
Q7,Dialysis will prevent all except?,"a)seizures
b)Peripheral neuropathy
c)Metabolic acidosis
d)uremic pericarditis","Dialysis does not prevent peripheral neuropathy. Complications like seizures, metabolic acidosis, and uremic pericarditis can be prevented by dialysis.
peripheral neuropathy is postulated to be caused due to middle molecules (5O-2OOkDa).
Conventionally used dialysis membranes have pore sizes that prevent larger particles (such as middle molecules) from passing through them.
suggested methods for the removal of middle molecules include:
• High flux dialysis
• protein adsorptive membranes



• High-cutoff membranes
Aggressive removal of middle molecules or larger low-molecular-weight proteins (LMWPs) has been a growing concern since it causes massive albumin leakage.
β2-microglobulin (B2M),α1-microglobulin (A1M) and albumin leakage during a dialysis session are useful parameters for assessing middle-molecule removal.
Renal transplantation is the best treatment option available for peripheral neuropathy in diabetes.",,B,
Q8,which of the following is not a treatment option in Guillain Barre syndrome?,"a)steroids
b)plasmapheresis
c)IVIG
d)Ventilator support","Steroids are not used in the treatment of Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS).
GBS is an acute, fulminant, ascending polyradiculoneuropathy that is autoimmune in nature. GBS is caused when immune response/antibodies against external antigens like infections, vaccines, etc target similar proteins present in the person's nervous tissue. Hence the preferred treatment is to  neutralize these autoantibodies using IVIg (I.V. immunoglobulins) or plasmapheresis (option B      and option C).
GBS manifests as rapidly evolving ascending areflexic motor paralysis with or without sensory
disturbance. GBS paralysis can also affect the muscles of respiration, possibly leading to death due to respiratory failure. In such cases, ventilatory support (option D) is needed.
Note: Steroid therapy is used in Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.",,A,
Q9,which part of the internal capsule is affected in hemiplegia due to ischaemic stroke?,"a)Retrolentiform
b)sublentiform
c)Anterior limb
d)posterior limb","The posterior limb of the internal capsule is affected in hemiplegia due to ischaemic stroke.
Motor fibers (cortico-spinal tract) supplying the extremities are present in the posterior limb, hence a lesion in this region may cause hemiplegia.",,D,4189-2677.PNG
Q10,which of the following is false about mycoplasma pneumonia?,"a)Responds well to amoxiclav
b)Antibody are useful in diagnosis
c)chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates
d)can be cultured in a cell-free medium","Mycoplasma does not respond to amoxicillin-clavulanate (amoxiclav).
Mycoplasma is a bacteria that lacks a cell wall. since beta-lactam antibiotics (amoxiclav) act on the cell wall of the bacterium, they can not be used in the treatment of mycoplasma infection.
The diagnosis of mycoplasma pneumonia (also known as walking pneumonia/ primary atypical pneumonia) can be established by:
• PCR detection of M. pneumoniae in respiratory secretions
• serological tests for IgM and IgG antibodies to M.pneumoniae in paired serum samples
• Culture: Mycoplasma can be cultured on PPLo agar, a cell-free medium, and shows a typical fried egg appearance
Chest X-ray usually shows B/L peribronchial and perivascular interstitial infiltrates
Treatment options for mycoplasma pneumonia  include:
•  Macrolides (e.g. azithromycin)
•  Tetracyclines (e.g. doxycycline)
•  Respiratory fluoroquinolones. (e.g. levofloxacin)
Azithromycin is the drug of choice for the management of mycoplasma pneumonia.",,A,
Q11,A 5o-year-old chronic smoker presented with mild recurrent hemoptysis without fever or    weight loss. The chest X-ray appears normal and the sputum is negative for AFB. which of the following is the next best diagnostic investigation?,"a)MRI
b)cT
c)Fiberoptic bronchoscopy
d)Bronchography","In this case, considering the patient's age of 5o years, history of chronic smoking, and recurrent hemoptysis, all of which raise suspicion for lung malignancy, the next best diagnostic
investigation would be a CT scan.
Any patient presenting with recurrent hemoptysis requires chest imaging. The initial imaging    modality is a plain radiograph. However, patients with risk factors for malignancy need further evaluation with a CT scan.
CT can identify masses, bronchiectasis, and parenchymal lesions. Further management depends    on the CT findings. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy, which is an invasive procedure, is done after a mass is seen on a CT scan to enable sample collection for biopsy. Also, bronchoscopy has an overall
lower sensitivity than MDCT in detecting the underlying causes of bleeding.
other options:
option A: while MRI can be valuable in certain situations, such as evaluating the mediastinum or vascular structures, a chest CT scan is generally the preferred initial diagnostic investigation for     assessing lung pathology, especially in cases of hemoptysis.
option D: Bronchography is visualizing the tracheobronchial tree on plain radiography by
instilling contrast material via the bronchus. It has been replaced by advancements in CT scans. Risk factors for the development of lung cancer:



• Tobacco smoking: Associated with 9o% of lung cancers.
• occupational and environmental exposure to carcinogens: Includes passive smoking,
environmental air pollution, radon, asbestos, arsenic, chromium, nickel, beryllium, and silica.
• Family history (genetic predisposition).
• other risk factors: Pulmonary scarring, previous radiation, pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic infections (e.g., tuberculosis, HIV).",,B,
Q12,which of the factors would suggest a risk for a patient with TIA developing stroke in the future according to ABcD2 scoring?,"a)Age &lt; 6o years
b)SBP &gt;13o mm Hg and DBP &gt; 8o mm Hg
c)Duration of TIA &gt;5 mins
d)Diabetes","According to the ABCD2 scoring system, which is commonly used to assess the short-term risk of stroke following a transient ischemic attack (TIA), diabetes would suggest a higher risk factor.
Age more than 6o years, sBP more than 14o or DBP more than 9o mmHg, and duration of TIA of 1o-59 minutes or more than 6o minutes are other criteria included in the ABCD2 scoring system.
TIA is defined as episodes of stroke symptoms that last for only a brief period of time (&lt;24 hours). The ABCD2 scoring system is most frequently used to calculate the short-term risk of stroke after TIA.",,D,
Q13,"The serum electrolyte values of a patient weighing 6okg are given below. calculate the
sodium deficit in the patient. pH: 7.42, Na+: 12o mEq/L, serum K+: 4 mEq/L, serum cl-: 9o mEq/L.","a)2o mEq
b)2oo mEq
c)4oo mEq
d)72o mEq","The sodium deficit is calculated as (target sodium concentration-current sodium concentration) x o.6 x Body weight (kg).
substituting the values, sodium deficit = (14o-12o) x o.6 x 6o = 72o mEq.
To calculate the sodium deficit in the patient, we first need to determine the target sodium concentration and compare it to the current sodium concentration.
The target sodium concentration can be calculated using the following formula:
Target Na concentration  = (Lower limit of serum sodium concentration + upper limit of serum sodium concentration) / 2
In this case, we assume the lower limit for the serum sodium concentration is 135 mEq/L, and the upper limit is 145 mEq/L.
Target Na concentration = (135 + 145) / 2= 14o mEq/L
Next, the current sodium deficit can be calculated using the following formula:
sodium Deficit = (Target sodium concentration-current sodium concentration) x Total Body Water (TBW)
Total Body Water (TBW) = Weight (in kg) × o.6 (assuming 6o% of body weight is water); TBW = 6o × o.6= 36 liters
sodium Deficit = (14o - 12o) x 36 = 2o x 36 = 72o mEq
Therefore, the sodium deficit in the patient is 72o mEq.



Rapid sodium correction of 4–6 mEq/L should be achieved in the first 6 hours of therapy for patients with acute hyponatremia.
The rate of correction should be comparatively slow in chronic hyponatremia: &lt;6-8 mEq/L in the first 24 h and &lt;6 mEq/L each subsequent 24h, so as to avoid osmotic demyelination
syndrome.",,D,
Q14,"In a patient with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), all the following can be used for treatment except?","a)Aspirin
b)clopidogrel
c)Streptokinase
d)Prasugrel","Streptokinase is not used in the management of non-ST segment elevation MI (NSTEMI). It is a
fibrin non-specific plasminogen activator used as a fibrinolytic agent in the treatment of
ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI). Aspirin, clopidogrel, and prasugrel are antiplatelet drugs commonly used in the management of NSTEMI.
Fibrinolytic therapy is not indicated in patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI, unlike in
STEMI. This is because STEMI is almost always caused by plaque rupture leading to the
formation of an occluding thrombus, whereas, NSTEMI can be caused by a stable non-occluding    plaque with some amount oflumen still patent. Fibrinolytic therapy may lead to the rupture of the stable plaque causing more damage.
Acute coronary syndrome is classified into 2 groups:
• ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)
• NSTE-ACS
NSTE-ACS further includes:
• NSTEMI (myocyte necrosis present and cardiac troponins elevated)
• unstable Angina (myocyte necrosis absent and cardiac troponins not elevated) The treatment of NSTEMI is as follows:
• Admission to a specialized cardiac unit
• Inhaled oxygen
• Bed rest with continuous ECG monitoring
• Monitoring cardiac biomarkers
• Morphine or opioid analgesics
• Nitrates
• Beta-blockers
• Antiplatelet drugs like aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel",,C,
Q15,"A patient presents with vertigo, diplopia, hoarseness, dysphagia, and left Horner’s syndrome   associated with numbness of the left face and right side limbs. which artery is affected in this



patient?","a)Posterior inferior cerebellar artery
b)superior cerebellar artery
c)Anterior inferior cerebellar artery
d)Basillar artery","These given features collectively indicate a diagnosis of wallenberg or lateral medullary   syndrome, which is typically caused by a lesion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery.



The patient presents with hoarseness and dysphagia, suggesting the involvement of cranial nerves IX and X, which helps localize the lesion to the medulla. Additionally, the presence of vertigo and  diplopia (involving the vestibular nerve), left-sided Horner's syndrome (involving the descending   sympathetic tract), numbness on the left side of the face (involving the sensory tract of trigeminal  nucleus), and numbness in the right side limbs (involving the lateral spinothalamic tract) further   aids in localizing the lesion to the lateral part of the medulla.
The absence of motor symptoms suggests that the pyramidal tracts in the medial aspect of the medulla are not involved, ruling out medial medullary syndrome.
wallenberg/lateral medullary syndrome affects:
Descending tract and nucleus of CN V- loss of pain and sensation over the ipsilateral half of the face.

Inferior cerebellar peduncle	ipsilateral ataxia
Lateral spinothalamic tract	loss of pain and temperature sensation over the contralateral half
of the body.
CN IX and X - ipsilateral paralysis of palate, vocal cord, diminished gag reflex giving rise to dysphagia, dysarthria.
Vestibular nucleus - Nystagmus, diplopia, vertigo, nausea
Descending sympathetic tract    ipsilateral Horner s syndrome (miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis).",,A,4193-2678.PNG
Q16,Resistant hypertension is defined as?,"a)BP &gt;16o/9o mmHg with one anti-hypertensive
b)BP &gt;14o/9o mmHg with one anti-hypertensive
c)BP &gt;16o/9o mmHg with three or more anti-hypertensives
d)BP &gt;14o/9o mmHg with three or more anti-hypertensives","Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure being persistently &gt;14o/9o mmHg despite taking three or more antihypertensive agents, including a diuretic.
Resistant hypertension is more common in patients aged &gt;6o years than in younger patients. Resistant hypertension may be related to pseudohypertension (high office blood pressure and     lower home blood pressure measurements), nonadherence to therapy, and secondary causes of



hypertension including obesity, excessive alcohol intake, and primary aldosteronism.",,D,
Q17,components of the MELD (2o16) score are all except?,"a)Bilirubin
b)INR
c)Albumin
d)creatinine","Albumin is not a component of the MELD (2016) score.
The Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) is used as an indicator of short-term survival in patients with end-stage liver disease and to determine organ allocation priorities for liver
transplantation. The components of the original MELD model were:
• serum creatinine
• serum bilirubin
• INR (international normalized ratio)
In 2016, it was modified to incorporate serum sodium (the MELD-Na score).
The latest MELD 3.0 scoring system has added two additional components:
• serum albumin
• Female gender
Patients with high scores have poor prognoses without intervention and should therefore be prioritized for transplantation if eligible.",,C,
Q18,"A woman with Grave's disease was taking antithyroid medication throughout her pregnancy. The baby was born with aplasia cutis congenita. which drug could have caused this
condition?","a)carbimazole
b)Levothyroxine
c)Methylthiouracil
d)Hydrouracil","carbimazole intake during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with aplasia cutis congenita.
carbimazole and methimazole are associated with teratogenic effects such as:
• Aplasia cutis congenita: congenital absence of scalp hair and skin along with calvarial defects
• choanal atresia
• Tracheoesophageal fistula
• Fetal goiter
The drug of choice for the treatment of hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy is propylthiouracil (PTU). It is because it has lower teratogenic effects than carbimazole or
methimazole.
However, propylthiouracil use is limited to the first trimester due to the risk of hepatotoxicity. It is replaced with methimazole (or carbimazole) in the second and third trimesters of the
pregnancy.
Radioiodine therapy is contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation.",,A,
Q19,"In the given acid-base nomogram diagram, areas marked A and D indicate which of the following conditions?","a)Chronic respiratory acidosis, acute metabolic alkalosis
b)Acute Metabolic alkalosis, acute respiratory acidosis
c)Acute respiratory acidosis, acute respiratory alkalosis
d)Acute respiratory acidosis, acute metabolic alkalosis","In the given illustrated acid-base nomogram, the letters A and D indicate acute respiratory acidosis and acute respiratory alkalosis.
An acid-base nomogram, also knoWn as a Davenport diagram, is a graphical representation of acid-base balance to interpret arterial blood gas (ABG) results. It helps determine the primary acid-base disorder and identify compensatory mechanisms.


The y-axis of the acid-base nomogram represents the arterial bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels, and the x-axis represents the arterial pH values. The shaded areas are the range of values of the normal     respiratory and metabolic compensations for primary acid-base disturbances.",4179-2673.PNG,C,4195-2679.PNG
Q20,A patient presented with the complaints of chest pain. which among the following is the best investigation to diagnose MI within 2-4 hours?,"a)LDH
b)CKMB
c)Troponin-T
d)BNP","Measurement of troponin is the best investigation to diagnose MI Within 2-4 hours.





Troponin T/I:
• Highly specific for MI
• Troponin I is more important than troponin T.
• Troponins will remain elevated longer than creatine kinase (ck), for up to 14 days.
• This makes troponins a superior marker for diagnosing MI in the recent past (late diagnosis).
• Reinfarction: It is now clear that cardiac troponin (cTn) increases rapidly, even if it is from an abnormal baseline in patients with reinfarction.
• sometimes cTn concentration is elevated, but stable or decreasing at the time of suspected
reinfarction. In this case, the diagnosis of reinfarction requires a 2o% or greater increase in the cTn measurement
creatine kinase (ck):
• Less sensitive and specific than troponins
• when cTn is available, ck-MB should not be used for the initial diagnosis of acute MI Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH):
• Normally, LDH2&gt;LDH1; but, in MI, LDH1&gt;LDH2. This is called flipping ofthe LDH ratio.
• current recommendations suggest that LDH no longer has a role in the diagnosis of MI. Myoglobin:
• Earliest enzyme to increase after MI.
• Not specific to cardiac muscle and can be elevated to any form of injury to skeletal muscle.
Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP), which mainly exists in cardiomyocytes, has
recently emerged as a potential biomarker, which was found to be sensitive for the early diagnosis
of acute myocardial infarction. H-FABP as an early marker and cTnI as a late marker would be the ideal combination to cover the complete diagnostic window for AMI",,C,4196-2680.PNG
Q21,"A patient comes with palpitation to ER. His Pulse-18o/min and BP-7omm of Hg systolic. ECG shows narrow QRS complex tachycardia with regular heart rate. what is the next step in
management?","a)DC Cardioversion
b)Adenosine
c)valsalva Maneuver
d)verapamil","The given clinical scenario of the patient presenting with palpitations and the electrocardiogram   (ECG) showing narrow QRS complex tachycardia with regular heart rate suggests a paroxysmal     supraventricular tachycardia. As the patient is hemodynamically unstable (SBP of 7o mmHg), the next step in management is DC (direct current) cardioversion.
PSVT is a narrow QRS complex tachycardia with sudden onset and termination. It mainly
presents with dizziness and palpitations. Evaluation of these patients includes monitoring of vitals and ECG.
The ECG below shows PSVT.


Management of PSVT is as follows:
1) when the patient is hemodynamically stable:
• Carotid sinus massage is attempted. It is avoided if carotid bruit is present and if a prior history of stroke is present
• Valsalva maneuver is done when the patient is cooperative
• Intravenous adenosine is useful in most cases. It is usually given in a bolus dose of 6 mg (IV
bolus over 2-3 seconds followed by a rapid flush with 2o mL NS followed by a dose of 12 mg if
required. However, its usage is contraindicated in patients with prior cardiac transplantation as it can aggravate bronchospasm and atrial fibrillation.
• Intravenous calcium channel blockers such as verapamil or diltiazem and beta-blockers are helpful but can cause hypotension.
• If there is no termination of the PSVT, then the next step is IV ibutilide + AV nodal–blocking agent (or) IV procainamide + AV nodal–blocking agent (or) cardioversion.
2) when the patient is hemodynamically unstable, i.e. when the patient has hypotension
(BP&lt;9o/6o) with unconsciousness or respiratory distress, QRS-synchronous DC cardioversion is done.",,A,4197-2681.PNG;4198-2682.PNG
Q22,High anion gap acidosis with low bicarbonate levels is seen in all the following conditions except:,"a)Renal tubular acidosis
b)Diabetic ketoacidosis
c)Lactic acidosis
d)Salicylate poisoning","Renal tubular acidosis causes normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, not high anion gap acidosis.
Normally, in the serum, the total number of cations is equal to the total number of anions. But, a few of the anionic proteins (e.g., albumin), phosphates, sulfates, and organic anions are not
measured and this is called an anion gap. It is the difference between measured cations and measured anions and is estimated as:
plasma anion gap = [Na+] -([Cl-]+[HCO3-])
The normal anion gap ranges between 6-12 mEq/L.",,A,
Q23,A patient comes to the hospital with chest pain for the last 3 hours. vitals are stable. ECG     revealed ST depression and T wave inversion in anterior chest leads. which of the following would be the most appropriate line of management in this patient?,"a)pCI
b)Thrombolysis with alteplase
c)prophylaxis for arrhythmia
d)Aspirin with heparin","Based on the given clinical scenario of a patient presenting with sudden onset of chest pain, with ECG findings of ST depression in the anterior chest leads and T wave inversion, the most likely    diagnosis is a non-ST-segment elevation-acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS).  The most
appropriate line of management in this patient would be to administer aspirin with heparin.
percutaneous coronary intervention is indicated after coronary angiography in high-risk patients. Fibrinolytic therapy is not indicated in patients with NSTE-ACS.
Arrhythmia prophylaxis is generally not routinely recommended in all patients with NSTE-ACS. Acute coronary syndrome is classified into 2 groups:
• ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)
• NSTE-ACS
NSTE-ACS further includes:



• NSTEMI (myocyte necrosis present and cardiac troponins elevated)
• unstable Angina (myocyte necrosis absent and cardiac troponins not elevated) The diagnosis of NSTE-ACS is based on the following:
Severe chest discomfort with at least one of 3 features:
• occurring at rest or minimal exertion and lasting for more than 1o minutes
• Recent onset
• Crescendo pattern
ECG showing:
• ST segment depression
• T wave inversion
Elevated cardiac troponins in case of NSTEMI.
Management of NSTE-ACS:
To provide relief of pain and discomfort, initial treatment includes bed rest, nitrates, beta blockers, and inhaled oxygen (only if arterial o2 saturation &lt;9o%).
Antithrombotic therapy consisting of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs:
• Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT): Aspirin (162-325 mg) AND one ADP receptor inhibitor (Ticagrelor, clopidogrel or prasugrel)
• Anticoagulation: Enoxaparin, unfractionated heparin, fondaparinux or bivalirudin
• An early invasive strategy including diagnostic coronary angiography (within 2–72 hours of
presentation) followed by revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention/ coronary artery bypass grafting) is indicated for stabilized patients who are at high risk of coronary events (Based on TIMI, GRACE or HEART score).",,D,
Q24,which among the following is the most life-threatening manifestation of CKD?,"a)Decreased GFR
b)Increased creatinine
c)Hyperkalemia
d)proteinuria","of the given options, hyperkalemia is the most life-threatening complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as it can result in cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death.
CKD is staged based on declining glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria. The various clinical manifestations occur due to loss of kidney function and accumulation of various uremic  toxins (urea, creatinine, and other products of protein metabolism).
Complications of declining kidney function include:
• volume overload
• Hyperkalemia
• Metabolic acidosis
• Hyperphosphatemia
• Mineral and bone disorders



• Hypertension
• Anemia
• Dyslipidemia",,C,
Q25,A patient presented with massive abdominal swelling. paracentesis fluid was sent for lab analysis and results show serum protein to be 3g/dL and ascitic fluid protein to be 1g/dL. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)Congestive heart failure
b)Early Budd Chiari syndrome
c)Late Budd Chiari syndrome
d)Tuberculosis","The likely diagnosis in the given clinical scenario with serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG)  &gt;1.1g/dL [calculated as serum albumin level - ascitic fluid albumin level, which in this case is 3-1=2g/dL] and ascitic fluid protein &lt;2.5 g/dL is late Budd chiari syndrome.
Serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) can be used to differentiate between ascites due to portal hypertension and non-portal hypertensive ascites. It represents the pressure within the hepatic
sinusoids and correlates with the hepatic venous pressure gradient.
It is given by the formula: SAAG = Serum albumin level - Ascitic fluid albumin level
Interpretation of SAAG:
• SAAG ≥1.1 g/dL indicates that the ascites is due to increased pressure in the hepatic sinusoids. It reflects the presence of portal hypertension.
• SAAG &lt;1.1 g/dL indicates that the ascites is not related to portal hypertension. It may be due to infection or malignancy.
In cases with high-SAAG (≥1.1), ascitic protein level analysis further helps in identifying the etiology:
• ≥2.5 g/dL indicates that the hepatic sinusoids are normal and are allowing the passage of protein into the ascites as in early Budd-chiari syndrome.
• &lt;2.5 g/dL indicates that the hepatic sinusoids have been damaged and scarred and no longer allow passage of protein as in late Budd-chiari syndrome",,C,

Q27,"A 13-year-old boy collapsed while playing football. ECG showed V5, V6 inversion and
prominent inverted T-waves. 2D echocardiography showed systolic anterior motion of the     mitral valve leaflet. which of the following features will be seen on clinical examination and which of the following are true regarding the management?","a)1 &amp; 3, a, c, d
b)2 &amp; 4, b, c, e
c)1 &amp; 3, a, d
d)2 &amp; 4, b, e","The given clinical scenario of a young patient with a history of sudden collapse following physical activity along with ECG findings of v5, v6 inversion, and prominent inverted T-waves, and 2D
echocardiography showing the systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflet point toward a diagnosis of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM).
In HCM, clinical examination may reveal pulsus bisferiens and an ejection systolic murmur that increases on standing.
Beta-blockers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) are used in the management.
HCM is a leading cause of sudden death in young. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with variable penetrance. HCM is characterized by the thickening of the septal
myocardium below the aortic valve leading to obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract.
symptoms:
• Exertional dyspnea
• syncope
• Angina, palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias
• sudden cardiac death (particularly during or after intense physical activity)
Examination:
• systolic ejection murmur best heard at the apex or lower left sternal border
• Holosystolic murmur from mitral regurgitation
• sustained apex beat
• s4 gallop
• paradoxical split of s2



• pulsus bisferiens: LV outflow obstruction causes a sudden quick rise of the pulse followed by a slower longer rise.
ECG findings:
• Left axis deviation
• p wave abnormalities
• prominent abnormal Q waves
• Deeply inverted T waves    Echocardiography findings:
• LV wall thickness ≥15 mm
• systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflet
• Mitral regurgitation Treatment:
• Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers are the first-line treatment
• Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) - indicated when the history of cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia is present

Q29,Correct sequence after p wave: A- 'a' wave B- 1st heart sound C- Rapid filling of ventricles D- 't' wave,"a)ABCD
b)ABDC
c)CABD
d)ACBD","The correct sequence is ABDC.
A - 'a' wave: The 'a' wave in the JVP waveform corresponds to atrial contraction and occurs just    after the P wave on the ECG (which corresponds to atrial depolarization) and just before the first heart sound.
B- 1st heart sound: The closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves at the beginning of ventricular    systole produces the 1st heart sound (s1) as the change in pressure across the AV valves causes     them to close. This sound occurs soon after the QRs complex on the ECG waveform representing ventricular depolarization.
The x-descent of the JVP waveform is associated with the ventricular systole. The c-wave occurs due to the bulging of the tricuspid valve into the atrium until the semilunar valves open.
D - 'T' wave: Following ventricular depolarization, the ventricles start to repolarize represented by the 'T' wave on  ECG. The 2nd heart sound (s2) occurs due to the closure of the semilunar valves.
C- Rapid filling of ventricles: Ventricular repolarization triggers the ventricles to enter diastole. During early diastole, there is a phase of rapid filling of the ventricles. This occurs as the atrial  pressure exceeds the ventricular pressure, allowing blood to passively flow from the atria to the ventricles.
The 3rd heart sound (s3) may be heard here. This event is associated with the v-wave and the y-descent on the JVP waveform as the ventricle relaxes further.",,B,4204-2684.PNG
Q30,"A 23-year-old medical student diagnosed with dengue developed epistaxis that resolved
spontaneously. He has been afebrile for the last 24 hours, and his platelet count is 14,ooo/μL. His BP is 11o/7o mmHg and there is a 28% rise in hematocrit. what should be the
management?","a)1 and 2
b)1, 2, and 4
c)2, 3, and 4
d)2 and 5","The given clinical picture of a student diagnosed with dengue with history of an afebrile period,  epistaxis, reduced platelet count and elevated hematocrit strongly suggests dengue hemorrhagic fever.
He should be kept under observation and given adequate oral and intravenous fluids (Statements
2,3 and 4).
clinical criterion for dengue hemorrhagic fever is:
• Acute onset fever lasting 2-7 days.
• Hemorrhagic manifestations: positive tourniquet test, petechiae, ecchymoses, purpura, or bleeding from the mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, injection sites, or other locations.
• platelet count ≤ 1oo,ooo cells/mm.
• objective evidence of plasma leakage: rising hematocrit/ haemoconcentration of ≥2o% from baseline or signs of plasma leakage (e.g., pleural effusion, ascites, hypoproteinemia/
albuminemia).
Severe dengue symptoms often come after the fever has subsided, when the capillary permeability may increase along with rising hematocrit levels. progressive leukopenia, followed by a rapid
decrease in platelet count, often precedes plasma leakage.
The main pathology in dengue is plasma leakage, resulting in intravascular volume depletion and thereby shock. So, supportive management with oral or intravenous rehydration is the mainstay   of treatment. If the patient is febrile, paracetamol is administered to maintain body temperature. NSAIDs should be avoided since they can cause gastritis, platelet dysfunction, and severe
bleeding.
patients should be kept under observation and vital parameters like blood pressure, urine output, platelet count, and rise or fall in hematocrit should be monitored.



Indications for platelet transfusion in dengue:
• platelet count &lt; 1o,ooo/cu.mm.
• prolonged shock with coagulopathy and abnormal coagulogram
• systemic massive bleeding",,C,
Q31,which of the following are true regarding KF ring?,"a)1, 2 and 5 only
b)1 and 5 only
c)1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
d)2, 3, 4 and 5 only","Among the given options only statements 1 and 5 are true.
Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings are seen in almost all patients of wilson's disease with neurological  involvement. It initially appears as a crescent in the superior pole of Descemet's membrane and gradually extends inferiorly, eventually becoming circumferential in shape.
KF rings occur due to copper deposition in the descemet's membrane. It is golden-brown to greenish-brown in color and can be best seen by slit-lamp examination.
The image below shows a KF ring :


while it is a characteristic sign of wilson’s disease (statement 2), it can also be seen in:
• primary biliary cholangitis
• primary sclerosing cholangitis
• cholestasis
KF rings are present in almost 95% of patients of wilson's disease with neurological/psychiatric symptoms compared to around 65% of those with hepatic presentations (statement 4).
They disappear on treatment with copper-chelating agents like d-penicillamine (while
desferrioxamine is an iron chelating agent) and reappear with disease progression (statement 3).",,B,4205-2685.PNG
