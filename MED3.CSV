Q1,"A 16-year-old girl, who is taking antiepileptics, has had a seizure-free period of 6 months. she has no family history of epilepsy. Her EEG is now normal and she has a normal neurological   exam and intelligence. what would your advice be?","a)stop the treatment and follow up
b)Gradually taper the drug and stop treatment
c)continue treatment for another 18 months
d)continue lifelong treatment with antiepileptics","In the given clinical scenario of a girl on antiepileptics for 6 months with no further seizures, no family history, normal EEG, neurological examination, and intelligence, antiepileptics should be continued for another 18 months since she’s already taken for 6 months (minimum 2 years) to    prevent seizure recurrence.
Anti-epileptic drugs withdrawal is considered only when an adult patient has been seizure-free for
≥2 years along with the following criteria:
• Normal CNS examination including intelligence
• Normal EEG and normal MRI



• single seizure type
• No family history of epilepsy.
It is preferable to reduce the dose of the drug gradually over 2–3 months.
other options:
option A: sudden cessation of drug therapy may cause recurrence of seizure hence not advised.
option B: The patient has a seizure-free interval of only 6 months and therefore, is not yet eligible for considering medication withdrawal.
option D: Life-long treatment is not necessary in this case as the patient meets all the
above-mentioned criteria for drug withdrawal after 2 years.
Note: Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), the most common idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome is known to have a high risk of seizure recurrence, and hence antiepileptics are     continued lifelong in a majority of patients.",,C,
Q2,AKIN and RIFLE criteria are used to classify,"a)Acute kidney injury
b)chronic renal failure
c)Acute glomerulonephritis
d)Nephrotic syndrome","AKIN and RIFLE criteria are used to classify acute kidney injury (AKI).
The various classifications used in AKI are:
• RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage)
• AKIN (AKI Network) classification
• KDIGo (Kidney Disease Improving Global outcomes) classification
RIFLE, AKIN, KDIGo definitions of AKI:

Q3,which of the following statements about polycythemia vera is true?,"a)Risk of thrombosis strongly correlates with the degree of thrombocytosis
b)Generalized pruritus is a consequence of mast cell activation by JAK 2 mutation
c)It is protective against H.pylori infection
d)Acute myeloid leukemia is the most common cause of mortality","Generalized pruritus seen in polycythemia vera (pv) is a consequence of the activation of mast cells by JAK 2 mutation.
other options:
option A: The risk of thrombosis strongly correlates with erythrocytosis, not the degree of thrombocytosis.
option C: In polycythemia vera, there is an increased risk of H.pylori infection.
option D: Thrombosis is the major cause of mortality in polycythemia vera. The incidence of acute leukemia in patients not exposed to chemotherapy or radiation therapy is low.
pv is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder in which red cells, granulocytes &amp; platelets    accumulate in the absence of a physiological stimulus. The most common mutation seen in pv is the JAK2 mutation.
Clinical features of polycythemia vera are:
• Thrombosis is the most common manifestation and is the major cause of mortality.
uncontrolled erythrocytosis causes increased viscosity of the blood causing thrombosis of the
vessels. patients may present with stroke, transient ischemic attacks, myocardial infarction, and Budd-Chiari syndrome.
• Aquagenic pruritis is generalized itching following a warm bath or a shower due to increased mast cells and histamine.
• Erythromelalgia is erythema and pain in the fingers, hands, and feet due to increased platelet stickiness.
• Splenomegaly due to increased destruction of RBCs in the spleen
• Gout is due to the excessive proliferation of the marrow cells leading to elevated uric acid levels.",,B,
Q4,All of the following are the core clinical features for the diagnosis of Lewy body dementia except:,"a)Fluctuating cognition
b)Recurrent visual hallucination
c)REM sleep behavior disorder
d)Orthostatic hypotension","orthostatic hypotension is not a core clinical feature of Lewy body dementia (LBD) as per DSM-5.
LBD also known as dementia with Lewy bodies is the second most type of progressive dementia   after Alzheimer’s disease. protein deposits, called Lewy bodies, deposit in nerve cells in the brain region involved in thinking, memory, and movement (motor control)



Core features of LBD as per DSM-5 are fluctuating cognition, attention, alertness, recurrent visual hallucination, and Parkinsonian symptoms. Suggestive features are REM sleep behavior disorder   and severe neuroleptic sensitivity.
Orthostatic hypotension, erectile dysfunction, and constipation are other features of LBD.
Treatment of LBD includes rivastigmine and donepezil which may improve cognition, and reduce hallucinosis and delusion. Pimavanserin may be used to treat psychosis.",,D,
Q5,"A 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of COPD develops a sudden
onset of palpitations. The following ECG changes are seen. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)ventricular tachycardia
b)Multifocal atrial tachycardia
c)Atrial fibrillation
d)Atrial tachycardia","The given clinical scenario of a COPD patient in ICU developing palpitations and the ECG
showing narrow QRS complex (&lt;o.12 s) tachycardia with more than three different P wave morphologies, points to the diagnosis of multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT).
Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) is characterized by at least 3 distinct P wave morphologies (shown by arrows in the image) with rates typically between 1oo and 15o beats/min.
It is usually encountered in patients with chronic pulmonary disease and acute illness. The clinical features are most commonly related to the underlying precipitating illness (COPD in this case).
Unlike atrial fibrillation, there are clear isoelectric intervals between P waves.
Treating the underlying disease and correcting any metabolic abnormalities is the mainstay of treatment. Electrical cardioversion has no effect.
The calcium-channel blockers verapamil or diltiazem may slow the atrial and ventricular rate.
MAT may respond to amiodarone, but long-term therapy with this agent is usually avoided due to its toxicities, particularly in pulmonary fibrosis.",4151-2662.PNG,B,
Q6,"A patient has recurrent optic neuritis of both eyes with extensive transverse myelitis. visual acuity in the right eye is 6/6o and visual acuity in the left eye 6/18. The patient showed a
partial response to steroids. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Neuromyelitis optica
b)subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord
c)Posterior cerebral artery stroke
d)Neurosyphilis","The given clinical scenario of a patient with recurrent optic neuritis of both eyes with extensive    transverse myelitis, showing partial response to steroids points to the diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), also known as Devic’s disease.
It is an aggressive inflammatory demyelinating disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of
optic neuritis and myelitis. Attacks of optic neuritis can be bilateral or unilateral and myelitis can be severe and involve three or more contiguous vertebral segments.
The core clinical characteristics include optic neuritis, acute myelitis, area postrema syndrome
with episodes of otherwise unexplained hiccups or nausea or vomiting, acute brainstem
syndrome, symptomatic narcolepsy or acute diencephalic clinical syndrome with NMOSD-typical  diencephalic MRI lesions and symptomatic cerebral syndrome with NMOSD-typical brain lesions.
Acute attacks of NMO are treated with high-dose glucocorticoids. Plasma exchange can be used in acute attacks that do not respond to glucocorticoids.
Drugs used for prophylaxis against relapses include mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab,
glucocorticoids, and azathioprine. Three monoclonal antibodies approved for attack prevention include eculizumab (terminal complement inhibitor), inebilizumab (B-cell depleter), and



satralizumab (IL-6 receptor blocker).",,A,
Q7,Deep y descent in JVp is seen in all except:,"a)cardiac tamponade
b)Restrictive cardiomyopathy
c)constrictive pericarditis
d)Tricuspid regurgitation","The y-descent in jugular venous pulse (JVP) corresponds to the fall in right atrial pressure after the tricuspid valve opening in the early diastolic phase of the right ventricle. Y-descent is
attenuated or absent in cardiac tamponade because of resistance to ventricular filling in the early diastole.
other options:
options B and C: Restrictive cardiomyopathy and constrictive pericarditis can have deep y descent due to rapid filling of the right ventricle during early diastole.
option D: In patients with tricuspid regurgitation, increased blood flow to the right atria through the incompetent tricuspid valve during ventricular systole results in a prominent v wave. when     the tricuspid valve opens during ventricular diastole, this increased blood in the right atria enters rapidly into the right ventricle during early diastole resulting in deep y-descent.",,A,
Q8,Tigroid white matter on MR imaging is seen in which of the following conditions?,"a)pantothenate kinase deficiency
b)pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease
c)Neuroferritinopathy
d)Aceruloplasminemia","Tigroid white matter on MR imaging is seen in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.
It is a rare, X-linked recessive disorder characterized by central nervous system dysmyelination. The proteolipid protein gene (PLP1) is affected, leading to the failure of axon myelination by
oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system.
Clinical Features:
• Nystagmus
• Developmental delay
• Psychomotor delay
• seizure
• stridor
• Feeding difficulties
• Ataxia
• Hypotonia progressing to spasticity.
The degree of dysmyelination is correlated with the severity of the clinical manifestations.
Genetic analysis can confirm the diagnosis. MRI shows a lack of myelination and MR
spectroscopy reveals aberrant N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and choline concentrations that reflect axonal and myelination abnormalities.
unlike other demyelinating leukodystrophies such as metachromatic leukodystrophy and
adrenoleukodystrophy, where myelin is formed but subsequently destroyed, PMD shows a failure



of myelin formation.",,B,
Q9,All of the following characteristics are found in the pleural effusion fluid of a rheumatoid arthritis patient except:,"a)RA factor
b)High glucose
c)cholesterol crystals
d)High LDH","Low glucose (&lt;6o mg/dL) is seen in the pleural effusion fluid of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
RA causes exudative pleural effusion and fulfills the Light’s criteria. High LDH and RA factor are   found in the pleural fluid of RA patients. Less commonly, patients with RA may have a cholesterol effusion. It is sterile and has a milky or opaque appearance. The milky appearance is due to the
presence of cholesterol crystals and an elevated cholesterol level.
Light’s criteria is used to distinguish between exudative and transudative pleural effusions. An exudative pleural effusion satisfies at least one of the following criteria:
• pleural fluid protein/serum protein &gt; o.5
• pleural fluid LDH / serum LDH &gt; o.6
• pleural fluid LDH more than 2/3rds upper limit of normal for serum",,B,4164-2668.PNG
Q10,what is the most common pulmonary manifestation of SLE?,"a)Shrinking lung syndrome
b)pleuritis
c)Intra alveolar hemorrhage
d)Interstitial inflammation","The most common pulmonary manifestation of SLE is pleuritis, with or without pleural effusion. The most common manifestations of different systems involved in SLE are:
• Musculoskeletal- arthritis and arthralgia
• Skin- photosensitivity
• kidneys- proteinuria
• Neurologic- cognitive impairment



• cardiac- pericarditis
• pulmonary- pleuritis
• Hematologic- anemia",,B,
Q11,True about the definition of postural Hypotension:,"a)Decrease in systolic blood pressure 2o mmHg after 6 mins of standing
b)Decrease in systolic blood pressure 2o mmHg after 3 min of standing
c)Decrease in Diastolic blood pressure 2o mmHg after 6 mins of standing
d)Decrease in diastolic blood pressure 2o mmHg after 3 mins of standing","orthostatic hypotension or postural hypotension is defined as a sustained drop in systolic Bp of
≥2o mmHg or diastolic Bp of ≥1o mmHg after 3 min of standing.
It can manifest as lightheadedness/dizziness, weakness or tiredness, difficulty
thinking/concentrating, blurred vision, and anxiety.
In non-neurogenic causes of orthostatic hypotension such as hypovolemia, the drop in the blood pressure is accompanied by a compensatory increase in heart rate of &gt;15 beats/min. In
neurogenic causes, there is aggravation or precipitation of orthostatic hypotension by autonomic stressors like a meal, hot bath, or exercise.
Non-neurogenic causes of orthostatic hypotension include
• cardiac pump failure - myocardial infarction, myocarditis, aortic stenosis
• Hypovolemia - dehydration, diarrhea, hemorrhage
• Metabolic - adrenocortical insufficiency, pheochromocytoma
• venous pooling - sepsis, prolonged standing, or recumbency
• Medications - alpha-blockers, diuretics, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants
Treatment includes removing reversible causes like drugs causing hypotension.
Non-pharmacological interventions include patient education regarding staged moves from supine to upright, raising the head of the bed, and increasing dietary fluid and salt. If these fail, drugs
like fludrocortisone and midodrine can be given.",,B,
Q12,The given pattern of EEG is found in:,"a)Hepatic encephalopathy
b)Creuzfeldt-Jakob Disease
c)Generalized tonic clonic seizures
d)Herpes simplex encephalitis","periodic sharp-wave complexes seen as spikes are seen in creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (cJD).
It is a spongiform encephalopathy that is characterized by rapidly progressive dementia,
myoclonus, akinetic mutism, cerebellar/visual disturbances. caused by prions. It is fatal and death occurs usually within a year or less from the onset.
EEG shows characteristic periodic sharp wave complexes (bi/triphasic). cSF assay is positive for 14-3-3 protein.
Four types of creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have been described:
• Sporadic (scJD): Accounts for 85-9o% of cases
• MRI shows cortical ribbon sign
• variant (vcJD): mad cow disease, kuru



• MRI shows hockey stick sign
• Familial (fCJD): 1o% of cases (these individuals carry a PRPc mutation)
• Iatrogenic
option A: Hepatic encephalopathy will show a triphasic wave pattern (negative-positive-negative wave). They are also seen in Hashimoto encephalopathy and Co2 narcosis.
option C: GTCS (generalized tonic clonic seizures)will show high voltage bursts &amp; high voltage spikes present in all the leads.
option D: HSV encephalitis usually affects one side temporal lobe showing a characteristic periodic lateralised epiletptiform discharge.",4153-2663.PNG,B,
Q13,Calculate the anion gap from the following values: Na+ = 137 mmol/L K+ = 4 mmol/L Cl- = 1oo mmol/L HCO3- = 15 mmol/L,"a)22 mmol/L
b)16 mmol/L
c)1o mmol/L
d)12 mmol/L","The anion gap is the difference between measured cations and measured anions and is estimated as:
Anion gap = [Na+] – ([Cl-] + [HCo3-])
Substituting the given values, AG is 22 mmol/L. Normal AG is 6 to 12 mmol/L with an average of 1o mmol/L.
The concentrations of anions and cations in plasma must be equal to maintain electrical
neutrality. Therefore, there is no real “anion gap” in the plasma.
However, only certain cations and anions are routinely measured in the clinical laboratory. The
cation normally measured is Na+, and the anions are usually Cl- and HCo3-. The value of plasma potassium is omitted from the calculation of the anion gap.
usually, the unmeasured anions exceed the unmeasured cations.
The anion gap will increase if unmeasured anions rise or if unmeasured cations fall.
The unmeasured anions include albumin, phosphate, sulfate, and other organic anions. The unmeasured cations include calcium, magnesium, and potassium.",,A,
Q14,"The ECG of a patient who presented to the ER is as given below. The patient was already
given a carotid massage and IV Adenosine but the BP is currently 6o/3o mm Hg. what is the next best step of management?","a)Repeat Inj adenosine 6 mg
b)Inj amiodarone 3oo mg
c)synchronised cardioversion
d)Defibrillation","The given ECG showing narrow QRS complex (&lt;o.12 s) tachycardia with absent P wave is
suggestive of paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia (PSVT). The next best step in the management of a patient with unstable vitals (systolic blood pressure &lt; 9o mm Hg) is synchronized
cardioversion.
Synchronized cardioversion is the treatment of choice in unstable PSVT patients, in which shocks are delivered with the defibrillator/monitor in synchronized mode with an initial energy level of    1ooJ. Synchronization times the delivery so that it is given at the peak of the QRS complex.
If the shock occurs in the ST segment or the T wave (unsynchronized), it can precipitate a more serious arrhythmia such as ventricular fibrillation.

other options:
option A: In the absence of hemodynamic instability, a repeat dose of injection adenosine (maximum of 12mg) could be attempted.
option B: IV Amiodarone is rarely used in the acute management of PsVT. Instead, it is used as an alternative to calcium channel blockers in chronic suppressive therapy.
option D: Defibrillation is only done for ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia.",4154-2664.PNG,C,4167-2669.PNG
Q15,Identify the diagnosis.,"a)Facial nerve palsy
b)plexiform neurofibromatosis
c)Masticator space abscess
d)Fibrous dysplasia","The given image showing thickening of tissues in the temporal and orbital regions with coarse overlying skin suggests a diagnosis of plexiform neurofibroma.
Plexiform neurofibroma represents an uncommon variant (3o%) of neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1).
Plexiform neurofibromas are usually evident at birth and result from a diffuse thickening of nerve trunks and surrounding tissues that are usually located in the orbital or temporal region of the
face. The skin overlying it may be coarse and associated with hyperpigmentation.



plexiform neurofibromas may produce an overgrowth of an extremity and a deformity of the corresponding bone.
NF1 is clinically diagnosed when any 2 of the following 7 features are present:
• six or more café-au-lait macules &gt;5mm in prepubertal and &gt;15mm in postpubertal
• Axillary or inguinal freckling
• Two or more iris lisch nodules
• Two or more neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma
• A distinctive osseous lesion such as sphenoid dysplasia or cortical thinning of long bones with or without pseudoarthrosis.
• optic gliomas
• A first-degree relative with NF-1",4155-2665.PNG,B,
Q16,what is the most common presentation of inhalational anthrax?,"a)Atypical pneumonia
b)Hemorrhagic mediastinitis
c)Lung abscess
d)Broncho pulmonary pneumonia","The most common presentation of inhalation anthrax is hemorrhagic mediastinitis, which is seen in 38% of the patients.
Inhalational anthrax also known as wool sorter’s disease is caused by Bacillus anthracis. Infection usually occurs among workers handling contaminated animal wool, hair, and skin in textile and    tanning industries.
patients present with malaise, fever, cough, shortness of breath &amp; headache. B. anthracis    spores are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages and transported to mediastinal lymph nodes. Hemorrhagic necrosis of the thoracic lymph nodes draining the lung results in hemorrhagic
mediastinitis. pulmonary infiltrates, mediastinal widening, and pleural effusion are other findings.
Treatment of inhalation anthrax includes a combination of intravenous ciprofloxacin and clindamycin for at least 14 days, antitoxins (Raxibacumab, obiltoxaximab), anthrax
immunoglobulins and steroids (if associated meningitis is present).
prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin (5oomg twice daily for 2 months) is recommended for anyone at high risk of inhalational exposure to anthrax spores.",,B,
Q17,A patient of hemophilia received multiple blood transfusions. which of the following metabolic abnormalities can be seen in a patient?,"a)Metabolic alkalosis
b)Respiratory alkalosis
c)Metabolic acidosis
d)Respiratory acidosis","Among the given options, the metabolic abnormality seen in a patient who has received multiple blood transfusions is metabolic alkalosis.
This is because the excess sodium citrate (anticoagulant) in the transfused blood gets converted to bicarbonate leading to metabolic alkalosis. Each mmol of citrate generates 3 mEq of bicarbonate    (a total of 23 mEq of bicarbonate due to each unit of blood).
Metabolic acidosis can also be seen in multiple blood transfusions as citrate is acidic, but metabolic alkalosis is more common.",,A,
Q18,"A patient with renal failure develops vomiting in ICU. ABG analysis showed pH - 7.4, Na+ = 145 mEq/L, Cl- = 1oo mEq/L, HCO3- = 24 mEq/L, paCO2 = 4o mmHg. what is the likely
metabolic abnormality?","a)Normal ABG
b)Normal anion gap, metabolic acidosis
c)High anion gap metabolic acidosis with metabolic alkalosis
d)High anion gap metabolic alkalosis with normal metabolic acidosis","The likely metabolic abnormality in this patient is high anion gap metabolic acidosis with metabolic alkalosis.
patients with renal failure may have metabolic acidosis and associated vomiting in this patient   may cause metabolic alkalosis. However, the parameters of arterial blood gas analysis appear to be normal. This disparity raises the suspicion of a mixed acid-base disorder.
when metabolic acidosis and metabolic alkalosis coexist in the same patient, pH may be in the normal range. In such cases, the presence of an elevated anion gap denotes the presence of
metabolic acidosis.
The anion gap (AG) is calculated as:
AG = [Na+] – ([Cl-] + [HCO3-]) = 145-(1oo+24)
= 21
AG is high, which points to high AG metabolic acidosis.
In high anion gap metabolic acidosis, excess H+ ions are buffered by bicarbonate and the
bicarbonate level falls. The fall in HCO3- is expected to be equal to the rise in anion gap. The difference between the rise in anion gap and the fall in HCO3- (delta gap) is zero in simple     HAGMA.
Delta gap = (Actual anion gap - Normal anion gap) - (Normal bicarbonate - Actual bicarbonate)     Associated vomiting in this patient results in loss of acid and hence the fall of bicarbonate level is less compared to the rise in the anion gap. A delta gap of more than +6 indicates the presence of  additional metabolic alkalosis.
In this case, the delta gap is 1o, which points to metabolic alkalosis in addition to high AG metabolic acidosis.",,C,
Q19,"A 56-year-old woman presented with a gradually diminishing visual field. She was found to have a pituitary mass and underwent trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy. Now she has low   levels ofACTH, TSH, FSH, and LH. which of the following hormone supplements is not
needed in the patient postoperatively?","a)Mineralocorticoids
b)Thyroid hormones
c)Glucocorticoids
d)Estradiol","The given clinical scenario describes a woman presenting with hypopituitarism following
trans-sphenoidal resection. Mineralocorticoid supplementation is not needed postoperatively as it is regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and not by ACTH. Therefore,
mineralocorticoid levels would remain intact despite ACTH deficiency.
Thyroid hormone, estradiol, and glucocorticoid supplementation are needed in this patient as their secretion is regulated by anterior pituitary hormones.
Features of hypopituitarism include growth abnormalities in children with a growth hormone
deficiency, insufficient levels of gonadotropins leading to menstrual irregularities, infertility in women and reduced sexual function, infertility and loss of secondary sexual characteristics in
men. TSH deficiency leads to stunted growth in children and features of hypothyroidism in both



children and adults. ACTH deficiency leads to secondary adrenal insufficiency.
polyuria and polydipsia may be seen and indicate a loss of vasopressin secretion in posterior pituitary lesions.
The following hormones must be replaced post-hypophysectomy:

Q20,A patient with acute hepatitis B has recovered from the infection. Identify the serological marker marked in the image:,"a)Anti-HBc Ab
b)Anti-HBs Ab
c)Anti-HBe Ab
d)HBsAg","The serological marker marked in the image which becomes detectable early in the infection and remains elevated for a long period after recovery from the infection is an anti-HBc antibody.
Anti-HBc is demonstrable in serum within the first 1–2 weeks after the appearance of HBsAg. It precedes detectable levels of anti-HBs by weeks to months.
IgM anti-HBcAg antibody is seen early in the infection for about 6 months and indicates a recent infection. IgG anti-HBcAg antibody is seen later, after 6 months, and indicates remote infection.",4157-2667.PNG,A,
Q21,The ECG of a pregnant lady having pre-eclampsia is shown below. Her vitals are stable. what is the best step in the management of the condition?,"a)IV calcium
b)Iv Mgso4
c)Dc shock
d)synchronised cardioversion","The given ECG showing a wide QRS complex tachycardia with waxing and waning QRS amplitude points to the diagnosis of torsades des pointes. As the patient is hemodynamically stable,
intravenous MgSo4 is the treatment of choice.
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) has a continually changing QRS morphology.
polymorphic VT that occurs in individuals with congenital or acquired prolongation of QT interval is referred to as torsades des pointes. patients present with near-syncope, syncope, or cardiac
arrest.
IV MgSo4 is highly effective for both treatment and the prevention of recurrence of long QT-related ventricular ectopic beats that trigger torsades des pointes.
If magnesium alone is ineffective, isoproterenol infusion or pacing, to a rate of 1oo-12o depolarization/minute usually suppresses VT recurrences.



If the patient is hemodynamically unstable, then immediate defibrillation should be done.

Q22,which of the following is the most common cause of infection post-solid organ transplantation in an Indian setting?,"a)cytomegalovirus
b)varicella zoster virus
c)Epstein-Barr virus
d)Herpes simplex virus","The most common cause of infection post-solid organ transplantation in India is
cytomegalovirus(CMV). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Herpes, and varicella are also known to cause infection post-solid organ transplantation but to a lesser extent.
CMV disease in recipients can present with fever, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, malaise, and
arthralgias. The diagnosis of CMV infection is established by nucleic acid testing (NAT) using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Management of this includes use of anti-viral drugs like ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir and intravenous immunoglobulins.",,A,
Q23,Addison's disease is commonly associated with ____,"a)Autoimmune adrenalitis
b)Adrenocortical carcinoma
c)Hypernephroma
d)Medullary carcinoma thyroid","Primary adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison’s disease, is most commonly caused by autoimmune adrenalitis.
Tuberculous adrenalitis is still a frequent cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in developing countries like India. It is characterized by the loss of glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and
adrenal androgen secretion.
Glucocorticoid deficiency results in fatigue, lack of energy, weight loss, fever, myalgia,
normochromic anemia, and hypoglycemia. Mineralocorticoid deficiency is characterized by
nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure, postural hypotension, salt craving, hyponatremia, and
hyperkalemia. Adrenal androgen deficiency manifests as a lack of energy, dry itchy skin, loss of libido, and loss of axillary and pubic hair (in women).
Hyperpigmentation is seen in primary adrenal insufficiency due to excess
proopiomelanocortin-derived peptides. Hyperpigmentation is not seen in secondary adrenal insufficiency.
The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency can be made with the short cosyntropin test (cortisol level &lt;45o-5oonmol/L sampled 3o to 6o minutes after ACTH stimulation is diagnostic of adrenal



insufficiency). plasma ACTH, plasma renin, and serum aldosterone can help differentiate primary from secondary causes. primary adrenal insufficiency will show elevated ACTH and a
compensatory elevation in renin levels due to decreased aldosterone in the body. In secondary adrenal insufficiency, ACTH is low with normal renin and aldosterone.
Treatment includes glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and adrenal androgen replacement.
other options:
option B: patients with adrenocortical carcinoma present with features of glucocorticoid and adrenal androgen excess, and not adrenal insufficiency.
options C and D: Hypernephroma and medullary carcinoma thyroid are not associated with Addison's disease.",,A,
Q24,which of the following is used in the treatment of hypercalcemia due to vitamin D toxicity?,"a)Dexamethasone
b)Hydroxychloroquine
c)chloroquine
d)ketoconazole","In patients with hypercalcemia due to vitamin D toxicity, glucocorticoids like dexamethasone are   the preferred therapy as they decrease 1,25 (oH2) vitamin D (calcitriol) production. This results in reduced intestinal calcium absorption and increased urinary excretion of calcium.
Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and ketoconazole may also decrease calcitriol production and are used occasionally. But the preferred therapy is steroids.
vitamin D toxicity presents acutely with features of hypercalcemia such as confusion, polyuria, polydipsia, anorexia, vomiting, and muscle weakness. Chronic intoxication may cause
nephrocalcinosis, bone demineralization, and pain.
Lab features include elevated 25 (oH) vitamin D, high calcium, and suppressed pTH.
Dexamethasone can also be used in the treatment of hypercalcemia caused by the humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (due to pTHr) and sarcoidosis.",,A,
