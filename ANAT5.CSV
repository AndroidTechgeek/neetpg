NUMBER,QUESTION,OPTIONS,SOLUTION,IMAGE Q,ANSWER KEY,IMAGE A
Q1,Identify the thickened nerve marked in the arrow in the image shown below:,"a) Great auricular nerve
b) Lesser occipital nerve
c) Facial nerve
d) Auriculotemporal nerve","The thickened nerve marked with the arrow in the above image is the great auricular nerve and the thickened nerve visible below the great auricular nerve is the transverse cervical nerve.
Nerve thickening in this case is likely to be due to leprosy.
Great auricular nerve:
It is the largest ascending branch of cervical plexus and arises from the second and the third cervical spinal nerves.
It winds over the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and ascends upwards. on reaching the parotid gland it divides into the anterior and posterior branches:
• Anterior branch - supplies the facial skin over the parotid gland and joins the facial nerve in the gland.
• posterior branch - supplies the skin over the mastoid process, posteroinferior part of the auricle, lobule, and concha.
clinical considerations:
• Leprosy - Nerve thickening is present. The nerve is palpable over the upper part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. (as seen in the above image)
• Frey's syndrome - An aberrant connection between the auriculotemporal nerve and great auricular nerve causes gustatory sweating. | test |

Q3,which of the following cranial nerve nuclei is not a part of the special visceral afferent (svA) column?,"a) Facial nerve
b) Trochlear nerve
c) vagus nerve
d) Glossopharyngeal nerve","The trochlear nerve nucleus is a part of the general somatic efferent (GSE) column, not the special visceral afferent column.
The trochlear nerve is a motor nerve that innervates superior oblique muscle in the orbit.
The neurons of the general somatic efferent (GSE) column innervate the extrinsic ocular muscles and muscles of the tongue (III, IV, VI, and XII cranial nerves).",,B,132-128.PNG
Q4,The joint between the attachment of the 8th and 9th rib to the 7th rib is a:,"a) Fibrocartilaginous joint
b) symphyseal joint
c) synovial joint
d) Fibrous joint","The interchondral joint between the attachment of the 8th and 9th rib with the 7th rib is a synovial joint.
Joints in the thoracic cavity are of the following types:
• synarthrosis - structures are connected by a fibrous band of tissue. E.g, 1st sternocostal joint
• synchondrosis - primary cartilaginous joints. E.g., costochondral joints
• symphysis - secondary cartilaginous joints. E.g. manubriosternal and xiphisternal joints
• synovial joints - the presence of these help the thoracic cavity expand during inspiration. E.g.:
• Interchondral joint
• sternocostal joint
• costovertebral joint
• costotransverse joint
Note:
The interchondral joint between the 9th and 1oth cartilages is never synovial and sometimes absent.",,C,133-130.PNG
Q5,which is the last fontanelle to close?,"a) Anterior
b) posterior
c) occipital
d) Mastoid","The anterior fontanelle is the last fontanelle to close. It closes at around 18-24 months of age.
Fontanelles of the skull:
| Fontanelle | Location | closes at |
| --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anterior | Between frontal and parietal bones, Junction marked by bregma | 18-24 months |
| posterior | sagittal and lambdoid sutures | 2-3 months |
| sphenoid | pterion | 2-3 months |
| Mastoid/posterolateral | Intersection of temporal, parietal, and occipital bones. | 6-18 months (average 12 months) |

Q6,which among the following is incorrect regarding sibsons’s fascia?,"a) Attached to the inner border of 2nd rib
b) covers apical part of lung
c) part of scalenus minimus muscle
d) vessels pass above the fascia","sibson’s fascia is attached to the inner border of the 1st rib, not the 2nd rib.
sibson's fascia (suprapleural membrane) serves as a plane of separation between the lower neck and the thorax and covers the apical part of the lung. It is attached to the inner border of the 1st rib and posteriorly to the anterior border of the transverse process of the C7 vertebra. It is strengthened by a few spreading muscular fibers derived from the scalene muscles. The subclavian vessels lie on top of it.",,A,135-132.PNG
Q7,The structure not passing through the aortic opening of the diaphragm is:,"a) Aorta
b) Azygous vein
c) Thoracic duct
d) vagal trunk","The vagal trunk does not pass through the aortic opening of the diaphragm.
It passes through the esophageal opening at the level of T1o vertebra.",,D,
Q8,The hard palate contains ________,"a) keratinised epithelium, submucosa, minor salivary glands
b) keratinised epithelium, absent submucosa, no salivary glands
c) Non-keratinised epithelium, submucosa, minor salivary glands
d) Non-keratinised epithelium , absent submucosa, minor salivary glands","The hard palate contains keratinised stratified squamous epithelium, has a submucosa, and contains minor salivary gland. This keratinised stratified squamous epithelium has regional variations and may be orthokeratinised or parakeratinised(found in hard palate and gingiva).
The bony structure of the hard palate is covered by a firmly attached mucosa in the central part. In the lateral parts, the hard palate also has a submucosal layer containing blood vessels. There are minor mucous type salivary glands in the submucosa in the posterior part of the hard palate.
(Note: In the orthokeratinized epithelium the cell nuclei disappear in the keratinized layer, whereas in the parakeratinized epithelium flattened, highly condensed nuclei remain in the cell cytoplasm of the keratinized layer until exfoliation)",,A,
Q9,"what is the function of the muscle marked as A in the image below, at the metacarpophalangeal joint?","a) Flexion
b) Extension
c) Adduction
d) Abduction","The muscle marked 'A' is lumbricals and they cause flexion at the metacarpophalangeal joints.
Lumbricals are intrinsic muscles of the hand that flex the metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP) and extend the interphalangeal joints (PIP & DIP).
They originate from flexor digitorum profundus.
• The lateral two are unipennate, supplied by the median nerve.
• The medial two are bipinnate, supplied by the ulnar nerve.",128-126.PNG,A,136-133.PNG

d) posterior cricoarytenoids",cricothyroid is a tensor of vocal cords.,,A,
Q11,The nerve of the second branchial arch is:,"a) Glossopharyngeal nerve
b) Trigeminal nerve
c) Facial nerve
d) vagal nerve","The facial nerve is the nerve of the 2nd pharyngeal arch.
Each pharyngeal arch is characterized by its own muscular components. The muscular components of each arch have their own cranial nerve. wherever the muscle cells migrate, they carry their nerve component with them.
The neurons of the 5th, 7th, 9th, and 1oth cranial sensory ganglia that supply the pharyngeal arch structures are derived from ectodermal placodes (epipharyngeal placodes) and from the neural crest cells.",,C,

b) It lies anterior to the poupart's ligament
c) It inserts into the pubic tubercle in front of the conjoint tendon
d) Its fibers fan out with fascia iliaca laterally","The fibers of the iliopubic tract fan out with fascia iliaca laterally.
The iliopubic tract is a thickening of the transversalis fascia lying immediately posterior to the inguinal (poupart's) ligament. It extends from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) superolaterally and arches across the front of the femoral sheath.
Attachments:
• Medially, its fibres insert by a broad attachment into the pubic tubercle and pectineal line, behind the conjoint tendon.
• Laterally, its fibres fan out within the fascia transversalis and fascia iliaca without bony attachment to the iliac spines.
clinical note: It is considered as an important landmark in laparoscopic hernia surgeries.",,D,137-134.PNG
Q13,ureteric bud develops from:,"a) Mesonephric duct

• Intermediate mesoderm is a type of mesoderm that is located between the paraxial mesoderm and lateral plate.
• It develops into a part of the urogenital system as well as the reproductive system.
• Intermediate mesoderm develops into Genital ridge and Nephrogenic cord.
• Nephrogenic cord further develops into pronephros, Mesonephros and Metanephros.
• ureteric bud develops from mesonephros which later fuses with Mesonephric duct.
• Metanephros proliferates around the ureteric bud which forms metanephric blastema (definitive kidneys).
