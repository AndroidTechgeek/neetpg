undiagnosed alcohol-related disorder.
Episodes of delirium tremens usually begin at the age of 3o-4o years, after 5 to 15 years of heavy drinking, and are typical after a binge. Gradual withdrawal of alcohol does not cause delirium
tremens. However, sudden withdrawal can cause it.
Treatment of alcohol withdrawal:
