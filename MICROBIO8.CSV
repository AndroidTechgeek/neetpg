Q1,which of the following causes aplastic crisis in hereditary spherocytosis?,"a)poxvirus
b)Ebstein barr virus
c)Adenovirus
d)parvovirus","Aplastic crisis in a child with hereditary spherocytosis is most likely due to infection
of parvovirus. This aplastic crisis is due to the transient arrest of erythropoiesis where the
parvovirus infects and kills the red cell precursors. This generally leads to a sudden worsening of anemia. Transfusions may be necessary to support the patient until the immune response clears   the infection.
parvovirus:
parvovirus-B19 is a non-enveloped single-stranded DNA virus.
Clinically, parvovirus B-19 infection may have several presentations-
• Erythema infectiosum - Also known as the fifth disease. The incubation period after infection is   typically around 4-14 days. The hallmark of erythema infectiosum is the characteristic rash, which appears initially as erythematous facial flushing, often described as a “slapped cheek” appearance. Later the rash spreads rapidly or concurrently to the trunk and proximal extremities as diffuse
macular erythema. The child may be febrile.
• Transient aplastic crisis - It may be seen in patients with underlying chronic hemolytic
anemia like sickle-cell disease, thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis, and RBC enzyme
deficiencies like pyruvate kinase deficiency. patients with aplastic crisis appear ill with fever,
malaise, and pale with tachycardia and tachypnea due to profound anemia. The rash may or may not be present. Children with sickle-cell disease may also develop vaso-occlusive crises.
• pure red cell aplasia - persistent B19v infection that results in pure red cell aplasia has been reported in a wide variety of immunosuppressed patients, including patients with congenital   immunodeficiency, AIDS, and lymphoproliferative disorders and transplant recipients.
• primary maternal infection is associated with non-immune fetal hydrops and intrauterine fetal demise
It is a clinical diagnosis not requiring investigations usually. However, in the case of pregnant    women or with other manifestations an IgM ELISA or pCR assay may be done. It is self-limited and resolves on its own.
The given image shows the classical slapped cheek appearance of erythema infectiosum caused by parvovirus B19. During the rash period, the patient is generally non-infectious.",,D,1513-931.PNG
Q2,"A stool sample is collected. The specimen is processed for examination and is labeled at
different levels as A, B, C, and D. Identify the level at which parasitic ova will be seen when viewed under a microscope.","a)A
b)B
c)C
d)D","The parasitic ova will be seen in a specimen taken from level D.
The image shows a formol-ether sedimentation technique to concentrate the ova in the bottom (D) part of the tube. It is used for samples in which the concentration of parasitic ova is scanty. It is
useful for all helminth ova/eggs and parasitic cysts. The ether adsorbs the fecal debris and floats. Formalin fixes and preserves the specimen.
This method is useful for all helminth eggs and protozoan cysts.",1405-855.PNG,D,1421-866.PNG
Q3,Identify the organism shown in this image.,"a)Strongyloides stercoralis
b)Enterobius vermicularis
c)Ancylostoma duodenale
d)Ascaris lumbricoides","The given image shows large cylindrical worms with tapering ends, and thus represents Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm).
Ascaris lumbricoides is the most common of human helminths and is distributed worldwide. It is the largest nematode parasite in the human intestine. The adult worms are large cylindrical
worms, with tapering ends. The anterior end is more pointed than the posterior. It appears white outside the body.
Its natural host is humans. There is no intermediate host. Adult worms live in the small intestine - jejunum and ileum. Humans acquire infectionby consuming food or water contaminated with
nightsoil or human feces containing eggs. The eggs contain the infective rhabditiform larva.",1413-862.PNG,D,
Q4,"A patient presented with meningitis, and the CSF sample was subjected to gram staining and microscopy and appears as shown in the microscopic image given below. which of the
following features/tests will be characteristic of the organism?","a)oxidase and catalase negative, does not ferment inulin
b)Ferments glucose and maltose but not inulin
c)oxidase and catalase positive and does not ferment maltose or glucose
d)catalase negative, optochin sensitive","The given clinical vignette of meningitis with the grams stain slide showing gram-positive
diplococci some in lancet-shaped and some arranged in chains narrows down the aetiological/ microbial agent to pneumococcus / Streptococcus pneumoniae. It is catalase-negative and
optochin sensitive.
The Gram stain would reveal Gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci, single cocci, or chains.
pneumococci undergo autolysis with the addition of surface-active agents like ox bile (1o%) or
sodium deoxycholate (2%). The viridans streptococci do not lyse and are thus easily differentiated
from pneumococci. The growth of pneumococci is inhibited by optochin (Ethyl hydrocuprein hydrochloride) while that of viridans streptococci is not. It is catalase-negative, ferments
inulin, and optochin sensitive.
pneumococci are commensals ofthe upper respiratory tract and can cause pneumonia, sinusitis, otitis, bronchitis, bacteremia, meningitis, peritonitis, and other infectious processes. The
pneumococcal infection results in inflammation and exudation of fibrinous materials resulting in edema and consolidation. The onset of pneumococcal pneumonia is usually sudden, with fever,    chills, and sharp pleural pain. The sputum is similar to the alveolar exudate, being
characteristically bloody or rusty colored. Disseminated infection and bacteremia can present as meningitis, endocarditis, and septic arthritis.
The other diagnostic parameters include the C-polysaccharide found in the cell wall of all S.
pneumoniae that can be detected in the urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and a
positive Quellung reaction.  Quellung reaction/ Neufeld reaction is used to identify capsulated
organisms such as pneumococci, Neisseria meningitis, Haemophilus influenza, etc. when a
suspension of a capsulated bacterium is mixed with its specific anticapsular serum and examined under the microscope, the capsule becomes very prominent and appears 'swollen' due to an
increase in its refractivity.
High-dose penicillin G is effective in treating pneumococcal infection.
The culture showing alpha hemolysis on blood agar, with optochin (op) sensitivity, and microscopy showing gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci,
suggests Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus).

Q6,A 32-year-old laborer working at a construction site presented with fever and hemoptysis. The sputum sample collected for examination showed the following. The smear will be stained by  which of the following sequences?,"a)Gentian violet - iodine - alcohol - saffranin
b)Methylene blue - malachite green- acetic acid-water
c)Methanol-methylene blue-acid-water
d)carbol fuschin - acid-alcohol - methylene blue","The given clinical vignette of fever and hemoptysis in a labourer with the sputum smear
showing acid-fast bacilli is suggestive of tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, detected on sputum smear, is appreciated by Ziehl-Neelsen staining, which would includes carbol fuschin - acid - alcohol - methylene blue.
Acid-fast bacteria (like MTB) in a stained Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) smear appear bright red against a blue background. steps involved in ZN staining are:
• place the sample on slide evenly spread it with rotational movement
• Air-dry the slide and fix it by passing it over a flame
• Apply carbol fuschin stain and heat to fix it.
• wash with water to remove excess stain
• Decolourise with alcohol
• Apply Methylene blue/Malachite green stain
• wash with water to remove excess stain
• view under the microscope
kinyoun modified the classical ZN staining such that heat fixing is not required. It is called the
cold method. It involves increasing the concentration of phenol acid and the duration of staining. The slide is then washed with water and decolourized with acid alcohol. counterstaining with

Loeffler's methylene blue or malachite green is done for a minute and viewed under a microscope. Acid-fast bacteria in a stained smear appear bright red against a blue background.
The image attached below summarizes the steps.


option A: It depicts the order of Gram staining, which was discovered by Hans christian Gram in 1884.
• primary staining with para-rosaniline dye (crystal violet, methyl violet or gentian violet).
• Application of dilute solution of iodine.
• Decolorisation with an organic solvent (ethanol, acetone, aniline).
• counterstaining with the dye of contrasting colour (carbol fuchsin, safranine, neutral red). option B: It includes the steps for performing Albert's stain which is used for detected
corynebacterium diphtheriae.
• A heavy smear of the bacterial isolate is prepared on a glass slide and allowed to dry without fixing.
• Albert’s stain is applied for (3-4) minutes. Then it is washed with water and Albert’s iodine is applied for one minute.
• wash with water and let dry with blotting paper.
• Examine the slide under oil immersion.
corynebacterium diphtheriae are slender bacilli with an arrangement resembling the letters V or
L. They have metachromatic granules at the poles of bacilli which are also called polar bodies,
volutin, or Babes-Ernst granules. Albert staining is useful in the demonstration of metachromatic granules. The presence of metachromatic granules helps to distinguish c.diphtheriae from
diphtheroids which lack them. The images below show corynebacterium diphtheriae.",1501-919.PNG,D,1517-935.PNG;1518-936.PNG
Q7,"A 55-year-old patient had a tooth extraction three days back. He now presents with a mass in the submandibular region which is otherwise asymptomatic. There is no ulcer on the oral
mucosa. on drainage of the discharge, it was foul-smelling with a lot of yellow granules. They showed gram-positive filamentous rods on grams staining. what is the most likely implicated pathogen?","a)chromoblastomycosis
b)Mucormycosis
c)Actinomycetes israelli
d)Histoplasmosis","This is a case of cervicofacial actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israeli. It presents as
a painless nodule that indurates with purulent discharge that contains sulfur granules giving it a yellow color. sulfur granules are composed of a matrix of bacteria, calcium phosphate, and host  tissue.
Actinomycosis is an indolent, slowly progressive suppurative and granulomatous infection that produces pyogenic lesions with interconnecting sinus tracts that contain sulfur granules. It is    an anaerobic or microaerophilic bacteria.
It presents as one of the following clinical types:
• cervicofacial actinomycosis- (most common site) fluctuant mass in the jaw area producing draining fistulas. (lumpy jaw)
• Thoracic actinomycosis- pulmonary infection with fever, cough, and purulent sputum. It usually occurs following aspiration or trauma leading to inoculation of the infective material.
• Abdominal actinomycosis- following ruptured appendix or ulcer. It may involve multiple organs.
• pelvic actinomycosis- due to the colonization of intrauterine contraceptive devices.
• Actinomycosis can spread to bones and surrounding tissue and produce multiple discharging sinuses.
Diagnosis is by Gram staining of sulfur granules that shows a dense network of thin gram-positive filaments, surrounded by club-shaped structures. (sunray appearance). culture shows the ""molar    tooth"" appearance of the colonies. on solid media, A. israeli produces spidery colonies.
penicillin G is the drug of choice and the duration of therapy is between 6-12 months. The other  drugs that can be used include amoxicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, clindamycin, and minocycline.

Q8,which of the following components of the fungal cell wall is not seen in mucormycosis?,"a)Mannoproteins
b)Beta 1, 3, glucan
c)chitin
d)Ergosterol","Beta-(1,3)-d-glucan (BG), a common component of many pathogenic fungi is absent in zygomycetes/ Mucormycosis.
Fungal cell wall:
The fungal cell wall is rigid and determines the shape of the fungi. These protect them from
osmotic and environmental stresses. They are composed of glycoproteins and lipids. some sugar polymers such as chitin, glucans, and mannans are also found in the cell wall. All these
components remain cross-linked to form a multilayered cell wall matrix. They exhibit
pathobiological properties and are responsible for provoking an inflammatory response during

infections. These are also species-specific and release immunodominant antigens that could aid in immunological testing. In addition, some yeasts and molds are described as dematiaceous because their cell walls contain melanin which forms host defenses.
clinical significance of Beta-1, 3-d-glucan:
G-test:
G-test is done for detection of α-3 glucan. It is helpful in establishing a diagnosis of candidiasis. Tests for beta-d-glucan:
The presence of an elevated level of β-d-glucan in the serum can be seen in candidiasis,
aspergillosis, and pneumonia due to pneumocystis carnii pneumonia. The same test cannot be  effectively applied in the evaluation of Mucorales. This assay is also not evaluated in routine in cases of cryptococcosis, not because of the absence of BG but because the capsule captures BG  even before it is released into the bloodstream.
Effectiveness of echinocandins:
Echinocandins inhibit the synthesis of glucan synthase, since there is no much of a role for   beta-glucans in mucormycosis, this class of drugs is seldom effective in the management of  mucormycosis. The drug of choice for the management of mucormycosis is amphotericin-B.",1502-920.PNG,B,
Q9,which of the following statements is True regarding trematodes?,"a)Fasciola hepatica are seen in the intrahepatic biliary radicles
b)Schistosoma are monoecious
c)Fasciola hepatica acquired through contaminated water
d)Triclabendazole is the treatment of choice for all trematode infections","of the given statements regarding trematodes, the only true statement is that Fasciola hepatica is seen in the intrahepatic biliary radicles.
schistosomes are dioecious, Fasciola hepatica is acquired through metacercariae encysted on raw aquatic vegetation and triclabendazole is not the treatment of choice for all trematode infections   as praziquantel is used in the management of schistosomiasis and lung fluke infections.
Trematodes are leaf-shaped unsegmented, flat, and broad helminths. The males are shorter and     stouter than the females. The unique feature of flukes is the presence of two muscular cup-shaped suckers (hence called distomata)- the oral sucker surrounding the mouth at the anterior end and    the ventral sucker or acetabulum in the middle, ventrally. Three of the most important
pathognomic species include schistosoma hematobium, Fasciola hepatica, and paragonimus westermani

Q10,"A 45-year-old man developed generalized muscle spasm with arching of his back as shown in the image, a few days after sustaining a puncture wound to his leg. The toxin responsible for  this type of abnormal posturing acts by which of the following mechanisms?","a)presynaptic inhibition of GABA and glycine release
b)presynaptic inhibition of Ach receptors
c)postsynaptic inhibition of GABA
d)cleavage of SNARE proteins, preventing Ach release","The toxin responsible for the abnormal posturing shown in the image is tetanospasmin produced by clostridium tetani. It acts by causing presynaptic inhibition of GABA and glycine release.
Tetanospasmin, after secretion by the bacterium is cleaved into two peptides linked by a
disulphide bond. The larger peptide diffuses to terminals of neurons and migrates by the
retrograde axonal transport system to the spinal cord and brainstem. It diffuses to the glycinergic  interneurons and GABA secreting neurons there. The smaller peptide degrades synaptobrevin and blocks the release of the inhibitory glycine and GABA. This results in hyperreflexia, muscle
spasms, and spastic paralysis. Even small amounts of the toxin can be lethal.
The incubation period of c. tetani ranges from 4-5 days up to 3 weeks. Muscle spasms usually involve the area of injury first and then the muscles of the jaw causing trismus or lockjaw.
Gradually, other voluntary muscles become involved, resulting in tonic spasms. Any external
stimulus can precipitate a tetanic generalized muscle spasm. The patient is conscious but may be in pain. Death usually results from respiratory paralysis.

Other options: proteolysis of target SNARE proteins in the neurons inhibits the release of Ach at the synapse - this is the mechanism of action of Botulinum toxin.",1503-921.PNG,A,
Q11,"A man with FUO has a job that requires traveling around the world. The bone marrow picture is shown below. which of the following investigation would be the most appropriate in this
case?","a)rk 39 antigen test, Leishmaniasis
b)pLDH, plasmodium malaria
c)Biopsy, Histoplasmosis
d)ELISA, HIV","The given clinical vignette of pyrexia of Unknown Origin (pUO) / Fever of unknown origin (FUO)   with a history of frequent travel is suggestive of an infectious cause of FUO. The given slide shows macrophages infested with intracellular Leishmania donovani bodies (arrows) characterized by a   kinetoplast and characteristic double dot appearance (Leishman stain). The most likely diagnosis   is leishmaniasis and it can be established by the rk 39 antigen test.
pyrexia/ Fever of unknown origin - criteria:
• Fever &gt;38.3 degrees c (101 F) on 2 occasions
• Duration &gt; 3 weeks
• Diagnosis is not certain after history, physical examination, and routine and obligatory investigations in spite of three OpD visits or after 3 days of hospitalization.
causes of FUO are enlisted in the table.
Leishmaniasis is a slowly progressing indigenous disease caused by a protozoan parasite of the    genus Leishmania. It is transmitted by the bite of an infected female phlebotomus sandfly which inoculates the flagellated promastigotes into the skin of the host in developing countries.
In human beings, the disease presents in four different forms with a broad range of clinical manifestations:
• visceral leishmaniasis, or kala-azar,
• cutaneous leishmaniasis,
• Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, and
• Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis.
The life cycle of Leishmania involves two forms,
• The promastigote which develops and lives extracellularly in the sandfly vector and
• The amastigote multiplies intracellularly in the reticuloendothelial cells of the host.
It lowers immunity, causes persistent fever, anemia, liver and spleen enlargement, and if left untreated, death may occur due to opportunistic infection.
The microscopic demonstration of amastigotes from bone marrow is the gold standard for the diagnosis of kala-azar.
For microscopic demonstration of the parasite, the materials collected are:
-peripheral blood
-Bone marrow
-Splenic aspirate
-Enlarged lymph node.

other diagnostic tests are:
• Rapid diagnostic test: rk39 Rapid diagnostic test and kala-azar dipstick test strip. This is recommended by National Vector Borne Disease control programme (NVBDcp) in India.
• parasitological diagnosis: Demonstration of LD bodies in buffy coat smear - confirmatory.
• Aldehyde test of Napier: widely used for surveillance.
• serological tests for diagnosis: Rapid dipstick test, Direct agglutination test, ELIsA, Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test
• Leishmanin (Montenegro) test: Induration of 5mm or more is considered positive, usually
positive 4-6 weeks (delayed-hypersensitivity) after onset in cutaneous leishmaniasis, valuable for distinguishing immune from nonimmune subjects and endemicity.
The given images show amastigotes in the bone marrow.

Q12,Identify the organism from the lifecycle shown in the image given below.,"a)cystoisospora
b)cryptosporidium
c)plasmodium knowlesi
d)Toxoplasma gondii","The given image shows the lifecycle ofToxoplasma gondii.
Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that causes toxoplasmosis.
• The life cycle of T. gondii
• The enteric cycle occurs in definitive hosts such as cats. Exoenteric cycle occurs in intermediate hosts such as humans, mice, rats, etc.
• Both asexual reproduction (schizogony) and sexual reproduction (gametogony) occur within the mucosal epithelial cells of the small intestine of the cat. The tachyzoites and tissue cyst represent stages in asexual multiplication, while the oocyst is formed by sexual reproduction.
• All three forms, trophozoite, tissue cyst, and oocyst occur in the definitive host. only the asexual forms, tachyzoites, and tissue cysts are present in the intermediate host.
• Asexual stage: oocysts containing sporozoites or tissue cysts containing bradyzoites are ingested by intermediate hosts like humans, sheep, etc. Bradyzoites and sporozoites are released in the
intestinal epithelium and form tachyzoites, which divide rapidly and replicates in all mammalian cells except for red blood cells. Tissue cysts are then formed which can occur in various organs     but principally persist in the central nervous system. This chronic stage completes the asexual
cycle and thus the parasite completes its life cycle in the intermediate host.
• The definitive host is the cat in which the sexual stage takes place. In this stage, the oocysts are formed, which after sporulation are excreted and if ingested by an intermediate host, cause
pathological changes.
• Tachyzoites continue to multiply and spread locally by the lymphatic system and blood, while the bradyzoites multiply slowly inside the tissue cyst. The dormant bradyzoites inside the cyst   may be reactivated in immune suppression causing renewed infection in the host.
• Transmission of human Toxoplasma infection
• This can be through oral routes from contaminated water or food, etc; it can be transmitted through blood or organs (transfusion or transplantation) and it can be transmitted through    the trans-placental route.
The below image shows the life cycle ofToxoplasma gondii.

Q13,All of the following oncogenic viruses can integrate with the human genome to initiate carcinogenesis except?,"a)HpV
b)HBV
c)HTLV
d)EBV","HTLV - Human T cell lymphotropic virus causes microbial carcinogenesis by indirect
mechanisms. Even, Hepatitis C virus, a flavivirus, does not generate a provirus and appears to induce cancer indirectly.
oncogenic viruses:
Integration of viral genome into the host cell thereby leading to the formation of a pro-virus is
commonly a mechanism of viral microbial carcinogenesis. DNA tumor viruses encode viral
oncoproteins that are important for viral replication. some portion of this may become integrated into the host cell chromosome. For RNA tumor viruses that mostly belong to the retrovirus family

are known to cause microbial carcinogenesis by indirect mechanisms.

Q14,"A patient presented with fever, dyspnea, palpitations, and tachycardia. The echocardiography revealed vegetation in the septal leaflets. Tissue sections from them reveal the following
findings as shown in the image. what is the most likely implicated agent?","a)pigmented septate hyphae at 9o degrees, Mucormycosis
b)Right angle branching septate hyphae, Fusarium
c)Acute angle branching hyphae, Rhizopus
d)Acute angle branching septate hyphae, Aspergillus","The given clinical vignette is suggestive of infective cardiac valvulitis with mycotic vegetation. The histopathological slide shows fungal hyphae of Aspergillus species with non-pigmented, narrow,    septate, hyphae with branching at 45o (acute angle).
Invasive aspergillosis is an opportunistic infection seen in the immunosuppressed hosts.
Aspergillus has a tendency to invade blood vessels. Thus, widespread hematogenous
dissemination with involvement of the heart valves and brain is common. Aspergillus
form fruiting bodies and septate filaments, 5 to 1o μm thick, branching at acute angles (4o    degrees). Aspergillus hyphae without the distinct fruiting body cannot be distinguished from Pseudallescheria boydii and Fusarium spp. by morphology alone.
Rhinocerebral Aspergillus infection in immunosuppressed individuals resembles that caused by Mucormycoses (e.g., Mucor spp., Rhizopus spp.). (option-A) Mucormycetes form broad
ribbon-like non-septate or sparsely septate pigmented hyphae of variable width (6 to 5o μm) with frequent right-angle branching, distinct from Aspergillus hyphae.
option B: Disseminated fusariosis differs from disseminated aspergillosis as the former presents with nodular or necrotic painful skin lesions are extremely common with fusariosis. No such
history is given in the clinical stem. The organism is difficult to differentiate from Aspergillus species in tissues; thus, identification with culture is imperative.
option C: Rhizopus shows aseptate hyphae with sporangium and sporangiophores. It is similar in appearance to that of mucormycosis.",1505-924.PNG,D,
Q15,which pathogen causes attachment-effacement lesion in the intestinal mucosa as shown in the image?,"a)Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli
b)Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli
c)Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli
d)Diffusely adherent Escherichia coli","The attachment-effacement lesion of the intestinal mucosa as shown in the image is caused by EPEC (Entero-pathogenic Escherichia coli).
E. coli is a gram-negative, flagellated rod. It is a lactose fermenter and hence, grows on
MacConkey medium to produce pink colonies.
Clinical infections are of four main types:
• urinary tract infection
• Diarrhea
• septicemia, neonatal sepsis and neonatal meningitis
• Pyogenic infections
There are mainly six types of diarrheagenic E.coli:
• Enteropathogenic E.coli (EPEC)

• Enterotoxigenic E.coli (ETEC)
• Enteroinvasive E.coli (EIEC)
• Enterohemorrhagic E.coli (EHEC)
• Enteroaggregative E.coli (EAEC)
• Diffusely adherent E.coli (DAEC)
Enteropathogenic E.coli (EPEC): It causes diarrhea mainly in infants and children. EPEC
adherence factor (EAF), a plasmid-encoded protein is responsible for adherence. Another
mechanism is adherence to enterocyte membrane by a locus of enterocyte effacement
(LEE), which is regulated chromosomally. This promotes tight adherence of the pathogen with loss of microvilli leading to effacement.
The electron micrograph below shows EPEC adherent to effaced microvilli of the small bowel.


Enterotoxigenic E. coli: Causes endemic diarrhoea in developing countries and travellers
diarrhoea. ETEC serotypes responsible for diarrhea are mostly o6, o8, o15, o25, o27, o167. It
attaches to intestinal mucosa with fimbriae called colonization factor antigens. The pathology is
due to the heat-labile toxin (LT) produced by some and heat-stable toxin (ST) produced by others.  Enteroinvasive E.coli (EIEC): The clinical features are similar to shigellosis. It produces disease by invading the intestinal mucosa.
Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC): It causes acute and chronic diarrhea (&gt;14 days in duration) in developing countries. These strains appear aggregated in a stacked brick formation. Some strains   of EAEC produce ST-like toxins, others produce a plasmid-encoded enterotoxin that produces
cellular damage, and still others, a hemolysin.
Enterohemorrhagic E.coli (EHEC): These strains produce two potent toxins, verocytotoxin (VT) or Shiga-like toxin (SLT). Especially in young children and the elderly, they cause diarrhea ranging     from mild to fatal hemorrhagic colitis and hemorrhagic uremic syndrome (HUS). EHEC primarily targets vascular endothelial cells leading to HUS. E.coli serotype o157: H7 is associated with
EHEC diarrhea and its complications.
Diffusely adherent E.coli (DAEC): These are less established as pathogens.",1506-925.PNG,B,1529-946.PNG

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a part of the outer membrane of the cell walls of gram-negative     bacteria. It accounts for their endotoxic activity and o antigen specificity. They were formerly known as the Boivin antigen. LPS consists of:
• o polysaccharide portion determining o antigen specificity
• core polysaccharide
• Lipid A (glycolipid). It is responsible for endotoxic activities such as pyrogenicity, lethal effect, tissue necrosis, anticomplementary activity, B cell mitogenicity, immunoadjuvant property, and antitumor activity.
The differences between exotoxins and endotoxins are summarised below.

Exotoxins	Endotoxins
Actively secreted by cells and diffuse into the surrounding	An integral part of the cell w   all of gram-negative bacteria;  death and in part during gro  wth; may not need to be relea sed to have biological activity
Produced by both gram-posit  ive and gram-negative bacteri a	Found only in gram-negative bacteria
Proteins	Lipopolysaccharide complexe s
Heat labile	Heat stable
Highly antigenic, stimulate t   he formation of high-titer ant itoxin.Antitoxin neutralizes t  he toxin	weakly antigenic


Exotoxins	Endotoxins
converted to toxoid, used to i mmunize (eg, tetanus toxoid)	Not converted to toxoids
Highly toxic	Moderately toxic
usually bind to specific recep tors on cells	Specific receptors not found on cells
usually do not produce fever in the host	usually, produce fever in the host


other options:
option A: 2 is the o polysaccharide portion of the LPS which determines o antigen specificity.
option B: 4 is the plasma (cytoplasmic) membrane. It is a thin semipermeable layer that lines the inner surface of the cell wall and separates it from the cytoplasm.
option D: 3 is the outer membrane. It is the outermost layer of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall. It contains various proteins known as outer membrane proteins.",1507-927.PNG,C,1531-947.PNG
Q17,"A 6-year old boy complains of cough and throat pain. on examination of the oral cavity, a
white pseudomembrane was visualized. A swab was taken from it and stained as given in the image below. what is the procedure for the following staining?","a)1, 2, 5, 8
b)6, 3, 8, 4
c)7, 8, 4, 3
d)3, 2, 1, 8","The image shows Gram's stain of corynebacterium diphtheria and the staining procedure is crystal violet, Gram's iodine, acetone, and safranin.
corynebacterium diphtheria (also called klebs-Loeffler bacillus) is a gram-positive bacillus with clubbing at both ends. They possess characteristic polymetaphosphate granules also called
metachromatic granules.
Gram's stain procedure:
• Fix the smear using heat or methanol.
• cover with crystal violet stain for 1o–3o seconds.

• Gram’s iodine stain used as mordant for 1o–3o seconds.
• Decolorize with 3o% acetone–alcohol for 1o–3o seconds, until the stain cannot flow off the slide.
• cover with safranin stain for 1o–3o seconds.
Image shows gram staining of corynebacterium diphtheria


other stains used for corynebacterium diphtheria:
• Albert's stain shows green bacilli with purple-blue metachromatic granules arranged in typical chinese letter or cuneiform arrangement. The stain requires two reagents:
• Albert’s I solution contains toluidine blue, malachite green.
• Albert's II contains iodine and potassium iodide.
• Loeffler's methylene blue: The granules take up the bluish-purple color.
• Immunofluorescence: This is more specific as the smear is stained with a specific antibody. Image shows Albert's stain of c. diphtheria



The incubation period of diphtheria is usually 2–5 days (range: 1–1o days).
Respiratory diphtheria is characterized by mild fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, malaise, loss of appetite, hoarseness (if the larynx is involved). The hallmark is a
gray-white pseudomembrane over the mucous lining of the tonsils (most commonly), pharynx, larynx, or nares. It is tightly adherent to the underlying tissue, and any attempt to dislodge the membrane may cause bleeding.
A few patients develop massive swelling of the tonsils and present with bull-neck diphtheria, due to edema of the submandibular and paratracheal region. cutaneous diphtheria may present as a  scaling rash or as ulcers with clearly demarcated edges and membrane.
The images below shows pseudomembrane, bull-neck, and cutaneous diphtheria respectively.





Treatment of diphtheria includes administration of diphtheria anti-toxin. Recommended
antibiotics include penicillin G and erythromycin. Prevention is with the diphtheria toxoid    vaccine. It is coadministered with tetanus and acellular pertussis (DPT) and should be given according to the National Immunization Schedule.",1507-926.PNG,B,1532-948.PNG;1533-950.PNG;1533-949.PNG;1534-952.PNG;1534-951.PNG
Q18,Identify the virus given in the following replication cycle.,"a)Human immunodeficiency virus
b)Herpes simplex virus
c)Hepatitis B virus
d)coronavirus","The given image shows the life cycle of the herpes simplex virus (HSV).
The herpes virus capsid is icosahedral and encloses a core containing a linear double-stranded
DNA genome. The nucleocapsid is surrounded by a lipid envelope derived from the modified host cell nuclear membrane. The envelope carries glycoprotein spikes.
Steps of HSV replication:

The virus enters the cell by fusing with the plasma membrane, and viral DNA is released from the capsid at the nuclear pore. This is followed by circularization of the genome and transcription of   immediate-early genes.
α-proteins are products of immediate-early genes. These proteins stimulate the transcription of
early genes. β-proteins are products of early genes. These proteins function in DNA replication, to yield concatemeric DNA. Transcription of late genes gives rise to γ-proteins. These primarily
consist of viral structural proteins and participate in virion assembly.
Viral DNA is cleaved from concatemers and then packaged into capsids. Enveloped viral particles  collect in the endoplasmic reticulum and are then transported by a vesicular movement to the cell surface.
Image shows replication cycle of herpes simplex virus.


other options:
option A) The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virus is spherical, enveloped RNA virus. The nucleocapsid has an icosahedral shell and a cone-shaped core, enclosing the ribonucleoproteins.    The genome icomprises two identical single-stranded, RNA copies, with the reverse transcriptase   enzyme, which is a characteristic feature of retroviruses.
The images below show the structure of the HIV virus and its life cycle.



option C: The hepatitis B Virus is a DNA Virus with an outer enVelope and an inner
nucleocapsid. The Viral genome consists of two linear strands of DNA in a circular configuration. one of the strands (the plus strand) is incomplete resulting in partially double stranded and
partially single-stranded DNA. The images below show the structure and life cycle of the hepatitis B Virus.




option D: coronavirus are enveloped RNA viruses with a genome consisting of positive sense  unsegmented single-stranded RNA. They have petal-shaped surface projections. coronavirus   nucleocapsids develop in the cytoplasm and mature by budding into cytoplasmic vesicles. The images below show the structure and life cycle of coronaviruses.",1508-928.PNG,B,1535-953.PNG;1536-955.PNG;1536-954.PNG;1537-957.PNG;1538-958.PNG
Q19,which of the following is a xenodiagnostic method?,"a)Rabbit ileal loop for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli
b)Injecting Aedes thorax with blood of a suspected dengue patient
c)Injecting a hamster with splenic biopsy for diagnosis of leishmaniasis
d)Intradermal test on guinea pigs for toxigenicity of corynebacterium diphtheria","Injecting Aedes thorax with blood of a suspected dengue patient is the xenodiagnostic method among the given options.
xenodiagnosis (xenos- foreign) is an indirect method of identifying the infectious disease agent or pathogen. In xenodiagnosis, the vector of a pathogenic agent is infected and the pathogen is
allowed to multiply in the vector. vectors are insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, mites, flies, fleas,   and lice that transmit infections and they act as the 'foreign host.' Later, the vector is examined for the presence of the pathogen.
For example, diagnosis of chagas disease: Laboratory bred Reduviid bugs (vector/ foreign host)
are allowed to feed on the suspected patients (original host). After 4-5 weeks, the feces of the bugs are microscopically examined for amastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi (pathogen).
Another method of xenodiagnosis is the intrathoracic inoculation of the mosquitoes (vector) with viruses (pathogen). The virus multiplies in different organs of the mosquito and can be easily
demonstrated. Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Toxorhynchites mosquitoes are used for the identification of the dengue virus.
In Trichinella spiralis infection, muscle biopsy bits from suspected patients are fed to laboratory rats (vector for T. spiralis). The larvae of T. spiralis can be demonstrated in the muscles of the     infected lab rats.
Advantage of xenodiagnosis: It is useful in cases where a direct microscopic diagnosis is difficult due to the low count of pathogens in the blood of the host/patient.
other options:
option A: Ligated rabbit ileal loop is used as a method of detection of Enterotoxigenic E.coli enterotoxins. It is not a method of xenodiagnosis as the vector of the pathogen is not being   infected.

option C: Injecting a hamster with splenic biopsy for diagnosis of leishmaniasis is a method of animal inoculation to help in confirmation of the diagnosis.
option D: Intradermal test on guinea pigs for toxigenicity of Corynebacterium diphtheria is a method of virulence testing.",,B,
Q20,"A 24-year-old male patient presented to the outpatient department with cervical
lymphadenopathy. As a part of the evaluation, the paul-Bunnell test was done. what is the principle of this test?","a)complement fixation
b)super-antigens
c)Heterophile antibodies
d)Haptens","The principle of the paul-Bunnell test is based on heterophile antibodies. Heterophile antibodies have the ability to agglutinate shared antigens.
paul-Bunnell test is the standard diagnostic procedure for infectious mononucleosis. In infectious mononucleosis, heterophile antibodies agglutinate sheep erythrocytes. However, such antibodies   may also occur after injections of sera and sometimes even in normal individuals. Infectious
mononucleosis antibodies may be differentiated by absorption tests. An agglutination titer of 1oo or above is suggestive of infectious mononucleosis.
The weil-Felix reaction is also a heterophile agglutination test. It is based on the sharing of a
common antigen between typhus rickettsiae and some strains of proteus bacilli. It is used for the   serodiagnosis of typhus fevers. other examples based on the same principle are streptococcus MG agglutination test for the diagnosis of primary atypical pneumonia and the cold agglutination test  for diagnosis of mycoplasmal (primary atypical) pneumonia.
other options:
option A: Complement fixation test is based on the ability of antigen-antibody complexes to    fix complement. This is a very sensitive test capable of detecting various types of antigens and antibodies.
option B: superantigens are certain protein molecules, that activate very large numbers of T cells  irrespective of their antigenic specificity such as staphylococcal enterotoxins. superantigens bind   outside the antibody binding groove directly to the lateral aspect of the TCR beta chain. Microbial superantigens are medium-sized proteins characterized by high resistance to proteases and to
denaturation by CD4+ T cells. They cause the release of cytokines (IL-2) which results in massive proliferation of T lymphocytes. This ultimately leads to further release of a variety of cytokines
which can have profound effects on the immune system.
option D: Haptens are substances that can react specifically with antibodies but are incapable of inducing antibody formation alone. Haptens become immunogenic (capable of inducing
antibodies) by combining with a larger molecule carrier. They may be complex or simple. while complex haptens can precipitate with specific antibodies, simple haptens are non-precipitating.",,C,

Japanese encephalitis virus is a virus from the family Flaviviridae. It is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis in Asia and the western pacific.

Transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus: Natural infection has been demonstrated in Ardeid birds (herons and egrets). Bird-to-bird transmission takes place through the vectors culex
tritaeniorhynchus and culex vishnui (common in India). Ardeid birds act as reservoir hosts, while pigs and cattle act as amplifier hosts. Humans are accidental dead-end hosts.
The image below shows the life cycle of Japanese encephalitis virus.

1. Accidental hos t	c. Human
2. Amplifier	d. pigs
3. Reservoir	a. Ardeid bird s
4. vector	b. culex


Most people infected with JE do not have symptoms or have only mild symptoms. Less than 1% of people infected with Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus develop clinical illness. The incubation
period is typically 5-15 days in persons who develop symptoms. Initial symptoms often include fever, headache, and vomiting. Mental status changes, neurologic symptoms, weakness, and
movement disorders might develop over the next few days. Seizures are common, especially among children.
No specific treatments have been found to benefit patients with JE, but hospitalization for
supportive care and close observation is generally required. Treatment is symptomatic. Rest,
fluids, and the use of pain relievers and medication to reduce fever may relieve some symptoms.
prevention: In India, inactivated vero cell culture-derived SA-14-14-2 is used. Japanese
encephalitis vaccine has been introduced in selected endemic districts. 2 doses of o.5 ml are given in the left upper arm subcutaneously.
If the first dose is delayed beyond 12 months, a minimum of 3 months gap should be there between the two JE doses.

Q22,which of the following is a dematiaceous fungus?,"a)Mucor species
b)Aspergillus niger
c)cladosporium
d)Blastomyces dermatitidis","cladosporium is the dematiaceous fungus in the given options.
Dematiaceous fungi are fungi whose cell walls contain melanin, which imparts a brown to black color. phialophora verrucosa, Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Fonsecaea compacta, Rhinocladiella
aquaspersa, and cladophialophora (cladosporium) carrionii are examples of dematiaceous fungi.
These fungi cause chromoblastomycosis, a chronic subcutaneous infection caused due to
traumatic inoculation of fungal agents. The lesion is verrucous and wart-like with extension along the draining lymphatics. cauliflower-like nodules with crusting abscesses eventually cover the
area.
on histological examination, the lesions contain the fungus seen as round or irregular, dark
brown, yeast-like bodies with septae, called sclerotic bodies or medlar bodies. Diagnosis can be   established by demonstration of these sclerotic bodies in KoH mounts or in tissue sections, and by culture on sabouraud agar.
chemotherapy with amphotericin B, thiabendazole, 5-fluorocytosine, itraconazole, and recently     voriconazole are useful for the treatment of larger lesions. small lesions can be excised surgically.
The image below shows sclerotic bodies seen in chromoblastomycosis.


other options:

option A: Mucor species causes mucormycosis. It is called black fungus because it causes serious angioinvasion leading to tissue necrosis and gangrene. It is not a dematiaceous fungus. They
