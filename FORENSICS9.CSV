Q1,"A guy was playing in a garden. suddenly, he collapsed and was rushed to the hospital. His
friend who played with him in the garden informed the doctors that he ate one of the fruits in the garden post which he seemed to have developed these symptoms. He also had irritability,  restlessness, dry hot skin, and was unable to pass urine and stools. Identify the poison and its appropriate antidote.","a)Datura, pralidoxime
b)Datura, physostigmine
c)yellow oleander, Digoxin
d)yellow oleander, physostigmine","The clinical vignette in the question is suggestive of Datura poisoning for which the appropriate antidote is physostigmine, a reversible acetylcholine esterase antagonist. It is an effective
treatment for severe anticholinergic poisoning.
Datura poisoning:
The common names include thorn apple, Jimson weed, and Devil's trumpet. The active
ingredients include the anticholinergic alkaloids atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine. The seeds or other parts of the plant can be ingested or smoked.
Toxic manifestations of Datura:
• Mnemonic: ""hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone, red as a beet, and mad as a hatter""
• Also, remember the D's of Datura
• Dry hot skin (Temp rises up to 42 C, a scarlet rash may also be appreciated).
• Dilatation of pupils along with loss of accommodation
• Diplopia
• Dryness of the mouth and throat, unquenchable thirst
• Dysphagia
• Dilatation of cutaneous blood vessels
• Dysarthria (Difficulty in talking)
• Drunken gait
• Delirium
• Drowsiness
• Death due to respiratory or cardiac failure Treatment
• Gastric lavage or decontamination with activated charcoal or tannic acid. Gastric emptying is
often delayed, and the small, plentiful seeds can become trapped among the gastrointestinal folds after ingestion; thus gastric decontamination can be an important therapy.
• physostigmine in severe toxicity given 1-2 mg IM/IV after every half hour as required. It is a physiological antidote. pilocarpine may also be given.
Medico-legal importance:
In India, datura is used as a stupefying poison prior to robbery, kidnapping, and rape. It is also   known as a rail-road poison, as it is commonly encountered during a journey. Robbers disguised as saints may offer ‘prasad’ mixed with datura seeds and rob the passengers.
yellow oleander:
All parts of the plant are poisonous. The active principles are thevatin, and thevatoxin, which are cardiac glycosides. The nectar of the flower yields poisonous honey. symptoms include



burning sensation in the mouth, tingling of the tongue, dryness of throat, vomiting, diarrhea,  headache, dilated pupils, irregular action of heart followed by drowsiness, coma, collapse, and death.

Q2,Identify the lesion shown in the image below.,"a)Laceration
b)Incised wound
c)Laceration looking incised wound
d)Incised looking laceration","The image depicts a wound with linear splitting of the tissue, sharp margins, and crushed hair follicles, which is suggestive of an incised-looking lacerated wound.
Incised-looking lacerated wounds are seen at sites where the skin overlies an area of the bone
where there is scanty underlying subcutaneous tissue. A blunt force causes linear splitting of the  tissue which results in the laceration resembling an incised wound. There will be extensive tissue crushing but the margins will be clear and delineable.
common areas are scalp, Forehead, Eyebrows, zygoma, Lower jaw, perineum, shin, and Iliac crest.
Laceration (option-A)
A laceration is a tear or a split in the skin, mucous membrane, muscle, or any internal organ produced by blunt force. The full thickness of the skin is penetrated.
Features of laceration:
• Margins are irregular with pieces of tissue attached in between called tissue tags or  bridges. Tears that are seen at the ends, diverging away from the main laceration are called swallow tails.
• Bruising is seen around the margins.
• Deeper tissues are unevenly divided with tissue tags.
• Hair bulbs are crushed.



• Depth of the wound contains abundant foreign material such as dust particles, paint material of the vehicle involved, etc
• In skin lacerations, usually one of the margins overhangs the other. This helps in assessing the direction of the force.
• A laceration, on healing, produces a permanent scar.
classification of a laceration:
• split laceration (incised - like laceration)
• This occurs when the skin is crushed between two hard objects
• For example, during a fall, the scalp gets crushed between the skull from inside and hard ground outside. This results in a wound, which usually mimics an incised one unless examined closely.
• stretch laceration
• As the name implies, it occurs due to the over-stretching of the skin, beyond its elasticity.
• This typically occurs in the setting of a fracture, where the fracture fragment may stretch and pierce the skin to project out
• Avulsed laceration
• An avulsion is a lesion where the skin separates or peels off by tearing from the underlying tissues. It may overhang the wound.
• This is common in road traffic accidents.
• Tears - Tearing of skin and subcutaneous tissue can occur from localized impact
• cuts - Injury leads to a deep and wide injury leading to a cut


Incised wound (option-B)
An incised wound is a clean-cut wound made with a sharp-edged instrument, through the skin
and subcutaneous tissues, including blood vessels. It is more in length than depth. The edges are well-defined and usually everted, free from contusions and abrasions. It is generally
spindle-shaped. The depth is more at the commencement and progressively becomes shallower,



known as tailing. Tailing determines the direction of the force applied when creating the wound. The image below shows two spindle-shaped incisions.


Laceration-looking incised wounds (option C)
In areas of the body where a loose layer of muscle fibres is attached to the skin, the edges of the     incision may become inverted, adherent, and wrinkled leading to it simulating a lacerated wound. such wounds are called lacerated-looking incised wounds. These are commonly seen in scrotum    and Axilla.",2770-1678.PNG,D,2777-1682.PNG;2778-1683.PNG
Q3,"A man was working in a field and he suddenly collapsed on a hot summer afternoon. on
examination, there were no physical signs of dehydration. His serum electrolytes level was   normal. The doctor found that the body temperature was 106 degrees Fahrenheit. which of the following symptoms is least likely to be seen in this patient?","a)Hot skin
b)Hypotension
c)sweating
d)Disorientation","The given clinical vignette in a patient with no signs of dehydration and body temperature of 106oF is highly suggestive of heatstroke. sweating is absent in heatstroke.
Heatstroke/ thermic fever/ heat hyperpyrexia is due to the failure of the heat regulation center of   the hypothalamus. It is caused by failure of cutaneous circulation and sweating. The predisposing factors include high temperature, increased humidity, minor infections, old age, lack of
acclimatization, alcoholism.
Heatstroke can be:
• Exertion-induced heat stroke is seen in people with prolonged exposure to or physical exertion in high temperatures, usually without adequate training.
• sedentary heatstroke is a disease of elderly or infirm people whose cardiovascular systems
are unable to adapt to the stress of a hot environment and release sufficient heat such that body temperature rises.
All the signs of shock are present. patients usually present with a sudden collapse accompanied by loss of consciousness. Typical vital sign abnormalities include tachypnea, tachycardias,
hypotension, and a widened pulse pressure. other specific signs include rapid kussmaul type of breathing, the absence of sweating with dry, hot skin, delirium, coma, convulsions,



rhabdomyolysis, multiorgan failure.
Although there is no single specific diagnostic test, clinical features of exposure to heat stress,    cNs dysfunction, and core temperature &gt;104.9-degree Fahrenheit (&gt; 40.5 degrees celsius) help establish the preliminary diagnosis. The body temperature must be measured rectally.
Treatment includes rapidly cooling the body with ice water till the rectal temperature falls below 1020F.
Autopsy findings include the presence of edema and reduction of purkinje's cells in the cerebellum.",,C,
Q4,"A young teenage boy with a history of drug abuse had been instilled with a shot of
intravenous cocaine at a party. He is rushed to the emergency room by his friends. some of     the symptoms were diaphoresis, headache, and acute coronary spasm. which of the following symptoms noted would go against the likely diagnosis of cocaine poisoning?","a)Myocardial ischemia
b)Bradycardia
c)Hyperthermia
d)Agitation","cocaine intoxication presents with tachycardia and not bradycardia. Thus, the presence of bradycardia would go against the diagnosis of cocaine intoxication.
cocaine is an alkaloid deliriant extracted from Erythroxylum coca.
Acute intoxication with cocaine leads to symptoms spanning 2 stages-
• stage of excitement/euphoria - associated with hypervigilance, anxiety, hyperactivity along with hyper-adrenergic signs of mydriasis, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, hyperthermia, and
cardiac arrhythmias.
• stage of depression - associated with loss of reflexes, muscle paralysis, circulatory and respiratory failure, and coma.
chronic intoxication is characterized by toxic delirium and tactile hallucination of bugs (cocaine bugs) or vermin crawling under the skin (formication).
common complications include cerebrovascular accidents and myocardial ischemia.
Treatment includes intravenous diazepam for controlling seizures. For ventricular arrhythmias, propranolol may be given intravenously. If the patient has psychosis, haloperidol may be given. Treatment of chronic cocaine abuse requires psychiatric support.
cocaine withdrawal is a triphasic syndrome that presents after the sudden stoppage of chronic cocaine use. The phases are as follows -
• crash phase (9 hours - 4 days): Anorexia, depression, excessive craving, hypersomnia, fatigue.
• Normal mood, anxiety, and anhedonia (4 - 7 days)
• Extinction phase (7 - 10 days): Absence of withdrawal symptoms but increased susceptibility to relapse.
Treatment for withdrawal includes bromocriptine and amantadine. They are useful in reducing cocaine craving.",,B,
Q5,The below phenomenon is due to,"a)case of torture falanga
b)case of suspension/hanging more than 72 hours
c)case of immersion in water for 36 hours
d)case of colliquative liquefaction due to immersion in hot water","The given image shows maceration of the skin of the soles suggestive of washerwoman's feet/ washerwoman's skin. It is seen in a case of immersion in water for 36 hours.
washerwoman's skin occurs if the body of the person has been immersed in water for a few hours to 3 days. The first signs tend to be on areas with an appreciable keratin layer (such as the
fingertips, palms, backs of the hands, and later the soles) where the surface becomes wrinkled,  pale, and sodden. This is called washerwoman’s skin. The first site affected is the fingerpads. It affects the hands earlier than the feet.
when a body falls into water in average temperate climates, the following is an approximate guide to timing:
The other signs of immersion are:
• cutis anserina - goose-flesh or piloerection: This is usually found when the body is immersed in cold water.
• post-mortem hypostasis - If the water is still, the postmortem hypostasis affects the heads and the limbs. This is because the chest and abdomen float higher because of the lungs and the
abdominal gases.
• Foreign bodies in respiratory passages and stomach - sand may be found deep in the respiratory passages and stomach, especially if the body has been rolled by the waves on a beach. This is not   evidence of live aspiration.
Note: signs of immersion just indicate that the body was immersed in water, they are not evidence of death from drowning.

Finding	Time since immersio n
No wrinkling of finger pads	Less than a few hour s
wrinkled fingers, palms, and feet	Few hours to 3 days
Early decomposition (Head a nd abdomen)	4-1o days
The marbling of veins, peelin g of the epidermis	2-4 weeks
Muscle loss with bone exposu re	1-2 months

Falanga (option-A) also known as Falaka or Bastinado, is a method of torture that involves repeatedly striking the soles of the feet with an object such as a truncheon, iron rod, cable, bamboo cane, wooden pole, or rifle butt.





Glove-stocking-like staining (option-B) is used to describe the purple-colored postmortem
staining visualized in the dependent parts of the upper and lower limbs of a hanging victim. It is absent in postmortem hanging, where the pattern of hypostasis does not correspond with the
position of suspension of the body
Liquefaction or colliquative changes begins by 5 days after death and becomes prominent in 1o  days. soft tissues change into semisolid masses which are black in color and get separated from bones and fall off.",2772-1680.PNG,C,2781-1684.PNG
Q6,what is the active principle of the poison shown in the image?,"a)Ricin
b)Bhilawanol
c)Abrin
d)calotropin","The given image shows the seeds of semecarpus anacardium, and its active principles
are bhilawanol and semicarpol. common names are marking nut, bhilwan, bibva, bhela, and oriental cashew.
The image shows black, heart-shaped seeds with hard rinds that identify them as seeds of s.
anacardium. within the fruit is a thick fleshy pericarp that yields the active principle, which is a brown oily resinous fluid called bhilawanol.
The juice when applied locally to the skin produces irritation, painful blisters, itching, and
eczematous eruption. The seeds are used to produce an artificial bruise. symptoms such as pain, fever, and painful passage of brownish urine may be seen.
A large dose taken orally can produce blisters in the mouth and throat, with gastroenteritis. It also produces dyspnea, cyanosis, tachycardia, coma, and death. The fatal period is 12 to 24 hours.
Medicolegal importance is the use of the juice by malingerers to fabricate wounds. Instilled in the eyes it can cause conjunctivitis or ophthalmia due to its local irritant effect.
other options:
option A: Ricin is the active principle of Ricinus communis. It is a toxalbumin or phytotoxin that inhibits protein synthesis by affecting the ribosomal RNA polymerase. The seeds are flat to
oval-shaped and have dark brown markings (shown below). It is a chemical warfare agent.





option c: Abrin is the active principle of Abrus precatorius. The seeds are egg-shaped, scarlet in color, and have a black spot at one end (shown below). on ingestion, it causes gastroenteritis
with bloody diarrhea, rectal bleeding, tachycardia, and circulatory collapse. Injecting the active substance can mimic viperine snakebite. Rarely, it may lead to tetanic convulsions.
The seeds ofA. precatorius are decocted and mixed with datura, opium, onion, spirit, and water to form a paste. From this, small sharp needles called suis are made. They are used for hunting
animals and even for homicide purposes.


option D: calotropin is one of the active principles of calotropis. The toxic parts of the plant are the stem, branches, leaves, and milky white latex (Madar juice). when applied locally, it can
mimic bruises, and form pustules and vesicles. In the eyes, it can lead to conjunctivitis. on ingestion, it causes abdominal pain, vomiting, mydriasis, and tetanic convulsions and can   eventually lead to collapse and death.
It is shown in the image below.",2772-1679.PNG,B,2782-1686.PNG;2782-1685.PNG;2783-1687.PNG
Q7,which of the following is true regarding the post mortem change shown in the image given below?,"a)seen within 24 hours of death
b)Due to sulphemoglobin accumulation and formation
c)Due to aseptic non bacterial cause
d)It is associated with a case of lightning","The postmortem change shown in the given image is marbling. It is seen when blood in the    vessels is haemolysed to sulfmeth-hemoglobin, which stains the vessel walls and the adjacent tissues, giving rise to a marbled appearance.
Marbling:
The marbling of the skin begins at about 24 hours and becomes prominent in 36–48 hours after    death. It is a visible postmortem change that is characterized by linear branching patterns on skin that correspond to the course of superficial veins. Intestinal bacteria infest the venous system and there is subsequent gas production and hemolysis which stains the vessel walls. This becomes
prominent in the summer and is distinctly appreciable in the superficial veins of the abdomen, shoulders, chest, and inguinal region.
Lichtenberg's figures or filigree burns are pathognomonic for lightning injury. It is a superficial, thin, tortuous, fern-like pattern of erythema in the skin. It indicates the path taken by the
electrical discharge and tends to follow skin creases and the long axis of the body. They are also known as arborescent burns or feathering as they have a resemblance to the branches of a tree.  Lichtenberg's figures occur due to the rupture of small vessels. They are usually seen over the     shoulder or flank within an hour of injury and disappear in 1-2 days.
Medico-legal aspect: Its recognition may be lifesaving in the unaccompanied comatose patient and is important because even delayed resuscitation of lightning victims can be very successful.
The image below shows the filigree burns seen in a case of lightning.",2703-1648.PNG,B,2743-1661.PNG
Q8,A guy was sitting on the balcony which was overlooking a park. He always used to sit nude on his balcony and derived sexual gratification by observing the people that look at him. This is    best described as?,"a)voyeurism
b)Fetishism
c)Exhibitionism
d)Masochism","The given scenario is suggestive of exhibitionism.
It involves behaviors over a period of 6 months or more, involving the exposure of one’s genitals to an unsuspecting stranger. The individual obtains sexual gratification from this. This is a
punishable offense (Section 294 IPC/ Section 296 BNS) with imprisonment up to 3 months or a fine.
The important and common sexual perversions are summed in the pearl attached below. The various punishments in the legal provisions include:

IPC secti on	BNS Sect ion	Section it deals with	Punishment
29o	292	Punishment for public nuisa nce (Frotteurism)	Fine Up to Rs.1ooo
294	296	obscene acts and songs (Exhi bitionism)	Up to 3 months of imprison  ment or fine (upto Rs. 1ooo) or both
297	3o1	Trespassing on burial places/ wounding the feeling of any   person /indignity to any hum an corpse(Necrophilia, Necro phagia)	Up to 1 year of imprisonment or fine or both",,C,
Q9,"A woman gave birth to twins. The father who believed that they did not belong to him
requested DNA testing. After testing, it was found that one child did not belong to him. This case would be best described as?","a)superfetation
b)superfecundation
c)supposititious child
d)Atavism","The given clinical scenario where one twin is found to not belong to the father of the other twin is suggestive of heteroparental superfecundation.
superfecundation is the fertilization of 2 different ova in the same menstrual cycle (as suggested by the same gestational age) by separate acts of coitus. It can occur even after artificial
reproductive therapy. Hence, after embryo transfer, intercourse must be avoided. Heteropaternal superfecundation is used to refer to instances of two different males fathering fraternal twins.
This leads to the possibility of twins also being half-siblings. This may give rise to the doubt of adultery and infidelity.
option A: superfetation is the fertilization of 2 different ova released in different menstrual cycles (i.e ovulation and fertilization during pregnancy). This can occur within 12 weeks of   pregnancy after which the decidual space is obliterated and a detailed evaluation will reveal disparities in gestational ages.
option c: supposititious child is also known as a fictitious child. In such cases, a woman pretends to be pregnant and generally substitutes a male child for a female child born of her, or after an
abortion. This is done for the purpose of claiming property.
option D: Atavism is the reappearance of a characteristic in an individual after several
generations of absence. For example, the child may not resemble his parents but resemble his ancestors. This is attributed to the recombination of genes.",,B,
Q10,"while recording evidence in the court of law, the lawyer asked the witness, ""Did A kill B in  your presence?"" The witness said, ""yes."" This type of question would be permitted in which procedural route in the court of law?","a)Examination-in-chief
b)Direct examination
c)cross examination
d)Re-direct examination","In the given scenario, the kind of question asked by the lawyer to the witness is an example of a yes/no question or leading question. Leading questions are
allowed during cross-examination according to section 143 IEA (Indian Evidence Act).
Leading questions (sec. 141 IEA) are defined as questions that suggest the answer that the person asking the question wishes or expects to receive. It is favourable for the case of the summoning
counsel or in alignment with their claim. They are not allowed during the direct
examination(Examination-in-chief) conducted by the summoning counsel (option A, B). The only exception to this is in the event that the Judge is satisfied that the witness is hostile, leading
questions may be allowed during direct examination.
In cross-examination, the witness is examined by the defence lawyer or adverse party with the objective to elicit favourable facts to their case, to test the accuracy of the witness statements,  unearthing new or old facts, and also, to discredit the witness. while leading questions are
allowed in cross-examination, the Judge can disallow questions that are indecent or scandalous (sec. 151 IEA) or questions asked with an intention to insult, annoy or offend the witness in any form (sec. 152 IEA). There is no time limit to the duration of cross-examination.
The sequence of examination in the recording of evidence is as follows -
