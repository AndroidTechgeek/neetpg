Q1,"A 4-year-old male child developed sore throat and difficulty in swallowing and mild fever. on examination, the clinical picture shown below is seen. which of the following sentences is
false regarding the vaccine that could have prevented this condition?","a)Its administered on the anterolateral aspect of thigh
b)A prior adverse reaction with temperature above 37 degrees is a contraindication
c)cellular pertussis component in the vaccine is not recommended after 7-years of age
d)The diphtheria toxoid dose in adults is much lesser than the pediatric dose","The image shows a dirty white pseudomembrane classic of diphtheria. A prior adverse reaction with a temperature above 37 is not a contraindication.
Precautionary measures are taken when the temperature is above 4o degrees, but it is not considered a contraindication for subsequent doses of DPwT.
Anaphylaxis is a contraindication for subsequent vaccination with diphtheria, pertussis, or tetanus vaccine. Encephalopathy following vaccination is a contraindication for pertussis vaccine. DT is
given for successive doses.
Events such as inconsolable cry, fever more than 4o.5°c, seizures with or without fever are considered as precautions, and not contraindications for DTwP.
The cellular component of pertussis is not recommended after 7 years.
• unvaccinated child 5-7 years: Give DPT 1, 2 and 3 at 1-month intervals. Administer booster dose of DPT at a minimum of 6 months
after administering DPT-3 up to the age of 7 years.
• unvaccinated child above 7 years: Administer Tdap (Tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and
acellular pertussis) at o, and Td (Tetanus, Diphtheria vaccine) at 1 and 6 months, respectively.
The adult dose of diphtheria toxoid is almost 12 times lesser in comparison with the pediatric dosage.
Note: IAP guidelines state that ""temperature more than &gt;4o.5°c is a precaution and not
contraindication"". Park's 27th Ed states that ""temperature above 4o°c is a contraindication to DPT"". This topic is controversial, however, IAP guidelines are commonly followed by
practitioners.",2456-1570.PNG,B,
Q2,which of the following parameters would you use to check the efficiency of the surveillance system for malaria under the National vector Borne Disease control programme?,"a)Annual parasite Index
b)Annual Blood Examination Rate
c)slide positivity rate
d)slide falciparum rate","The Annual Blood Examination Rate (ABER) is used to check the efficiency of the surveillance

Q3,which of the following is false regarding confounding factor?,"a)It can be reduced by matching
b)It is associated individually with both cause and effect
c)It is distributed equally in both study and control groups
d)It is associated with the exposure of the study","A confounding factor is a factor that is associated with both exposure and diseases and is distributed unequally in study and control groups. It can be reduced by matching.
For example, if the study is that a sedentary lifestyle can lead to coronary artery diseases, then age can act as a confounding factor as it is individually linked to both sedentary lifestyle and coronary artery diseases.",,C,
Q4,which of the following is the best level of prevention of breast cancer?,"a)specific protection
b)Early diagnosis and treatment
c)Disability limitation
d)Rehabilitation","Early diagnosis and treatment is the best level of prevention of breast cancer. It is a secondary level of prevention.
The earlier a disease is diagnosed and treated, the better is the prognosis. The occurrence of   secondary cases or any long term disability can be prevented. This is of particular importance in chronic diseases.
Early diagnosis and treatment is not as effective and economical as primary prevention. However, it may be critically important in reducing the high morbidity and mortality in diseases such as
essential hypertension, cancer cervix and breast cancer.",,B,

IU given immediately, followed by the same age-specific dose 24 hours later and after 2 weeks.",,D,
Q6,"In a normal curve, what is the percentage of distribution of one standard deviation?","a)68%
b)34%
c)99%
d)95%","Approximately 68% of a normal distribution falls within ±1 standard deviations of the mean. This is as per the empirical rule of a normal distribution.

Q7,"According to IMNcI, a 6-month-old child is said to have pneumonia if the child has fast breathing with a respiratory rate more than:","a)4o
b)6o
c)3o
d)5o","Three key clinical signs are used to assess a sick child with cough or difficult breathing:

children are classified as pneumonia if:
• &gt; 5o/min RR for infants 2 months to 12 months
• &gt; 4o/min RR for children 12 months to 5 years of age
• Lower chest wall indrawing indicates severe pneumonia
• stridor indicates those with severe pneumonia requiring hospital admission.
The following image gives the IMNcI classification for cough/difficulty in breathing in children.

• persistent vomiting
• convulsions
• Lethargic or unconscious
• stridor in a calm child
• severe malnutrition",,D,Picture20.png

b)5 acres
c)2 acres
d)1 acre","In controlled tipping, one acre of land is required by the trench method to be practiced for a population of 1o,ooo.

Q14,"If a patient tests positive for a disease, which of the following represents the probability of her actually having the disease?","a)sensitivity
b)specificity
c)positive predictive value
d)Negative predictive value","Positive predictive value implies the probability of a person with a positive test, actually having the disease.
It is the ability of a test to detect true positive(TP) out of total positive(TP+FP) and it is directly proportional to the prevalence of a disease.
PPV= TP/TP+FP",,C,
Q15,"In the following natural history of disease flowchart, point A to C is called as?","a)screening time
b)Lead time
c)Lag time
d)Generation time","Lead time is the period between the first possible time of detection (point A) and the usual time of diagnosis (point C).
screening time is the time difference between the first point of diagnosis and the critical point of diagnosis.
Diagnosis of a disease before the critical point has a good outcome and reduces the severity by
reversing the disease process. Diagnosis beyond the critical point treatment would be unsuccessful and/or permanent damage would have occurred.
screening must be done in conditions where there is a considerable time lag between the onset of disease and the usual time of diagnosis. That is conditions with a long lead time.
Generation time is defined as the interval of time between the onset of infection by a host and the maximal infectivity of that host.",2460-1571.PNG,B,

c)component bar graph
d)Multiple bar graphs","The given image shows a component bar graph. It is used to represent data in which the total magnitude is divided into different subsets or components.
A bar chart or bar graph is used mainly for nominal or ordinal scale data. They can be simple, multiple or component bar graphs.
The image given below shows a multiple bar graph showing the human losses of world war II by country. In a multiple bar chart, 2 or more sets of data are shown simultaneously.





A bar chart can be distinguished from a histogram because the rectangles are separated by the spaces. This indicates that the data forms discrete categories.
In a histogram, the rectangles are not separated by spaces as the data represented forms a continuous set instead of discrete groups.",2461-1572.PNG,C,2469-1573.PNG
