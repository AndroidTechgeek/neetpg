Q1,During the post mortem examination following finding is seen. what is this indicative of,"a)choking
b)Throttling
c)Hanging
d)smothering","Abrasions around the mouth, cheeks, lips or lesions within the lips may reliably indicate smothering.
The non-specific signs of death due to asphyxia:
• petechial haemorrhages in the face, eyebrows, eyelids, forehead, ears, conjunctiva, sclera - when they occur in the visceral pleura, they are called Tardieu’s spots
• Emphysematous, congested lungs with serosanguinous fluid exudates in alveoli.
• cyanosis or dark-coloured blood due to accumulation of co2.
• congestion of the larynx with slight oozing
pressure marks on the face can occur as a part of normal postmortem changes. circumoral and  circumnasal pallor can be caused merely by passive pressure of the dependent head after death.



Note: The coexistence of these findings, in themselves, does not prove that death resulted from mechanical asphyxia. All these phenomena are non-specific and are in no way peculiar to this    mode of death. They are of no value in proving that death resulted from mechanical asphyxia.",2885-1734.PNG,D,

Q3,A man sexually aroused when he wears his female partner's dress and heels. He denies getting attracted to male. what is this condition called?,"a)Gay sexual preference
b)Transvestic fetishism
c)Gender dysphoria
d)voyeurism","The given scenario is suggestive of transvestic fetishism.
It is a paraphilia characterized by recurrent sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behavior involving the wearing of clothes of the opposite sex and appearing as a member of the opposite
sex. It is also called transvestic fetishism. It is usually seen in males who obtain sexual pleasure by wearing female clothes.
Fetishistic transvestism is a paraphilia whereas transvestism is a gender identity disorder. There is no hormonal/genital abnormality in fetishistic transvestism.
option A : Gay sexual preference is due to attraction to people of one's own gender.
option C: Gender dysphoria is a term that describes a sense of unease that a person has due to a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity. This sense of unease or
dissatisfaction can lead to depression and anxiety and can have a harmful impact on daily life.



option D : voyeurism/peeping Tom/scotophilia is sexual gratification by secretly watching others getting undressed, taking a bath, performing sexual intercourse, etc.",,B,
Q4,"A woman gave birth to a child 8 months after the death of her husband. The in-laws claim    that the child is not their son, however, the DNA testing confirms the paternity. The child is known as ____________","a)Illegitimate child
b)posthumous child
c)surrogate child
d)supposititious child","The child delivered after the death of the biological father, or a child delivered after the death of the biological mother, usually when delivered by a cesarean section is a posthumous child.
Legal issues involved with a posthumous child are legitimacy, inheritance of property, and the case of compensation for slander against the mother.
other options :
option A: Illegitimate child is a child born out of wedlock i.e. when the parents are unmarried.
option C: A surrogate child is born out of a pregnancy in which a woman gives birth to a baby for a person who is not able to have children.
option D: supposititious child or fictitious child is when a woman pretends to go through
pregnancy and delivery. Later, she produces a living child on her own to obtain money or claim the property.",,B,
Q5,"The railway police has bought a person with suspected poisoning. on examination, he was confused with slurred speech, hot skin, dry mouth, dilated pupils. what is the probable
poisoning ?","a)cocaine
b)Datura
c)cannabis
d)Alcohol","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of Datura poisoning.
The two species are jimson weed (Datura stramonium) and angel’s trumpet (Datura candida).
seeds or other parts of the plant can be ingested or smoked. poisoning leads to delirium,
hallucinations, and seizures. Additionally, other classic anticholinergic effects, such as mydriasis, tachycardia, dry mouth and skin, blurred vision, urinary retention, and hyperthermia may
present.
Gastric emptying is often delayed, and the small, plentiful seeds can become trapped among the  gastrointestinal folds after ingestion. Thus gastric decontamination can be an important therapy.
physostigmine, a reversible acetylcholine esterase antagonist, is an effective treatment for severe anticholinergic poisoning.",,B,
Q6,"A police officer brought a child to the hospital. There is redness and tenderness around
perianal region. A rectal swab is taken and the image given below is the finding. what test is it indicative of?","a)Barberio test
b)Florence test
c)Teichmann test
d)Takayama test","The test done in this scenario is the Barberio test.
Barberio test is used to detect seminal fluid. when a saturated aqueous or alcoholic picric acid solution is added to the spermatic fluid, yellow needle-shaped rhombic crystals of spermine
picrate are produced.
other options:



option B: The Florence test detects semen. If semen is present, dark brown rhombic or needle-shaped crystals of choline iodide appear immediately.
option C: The Teichmann test (hemin crystal test) is used to detect bloodstains. If bloodstain is present, faint yellowish-red to brownish-black rhombic crystals of hemin or hematin chloride     appear. when hydrogen peroxide is added, the hematin crystals give bubbles of gas.
option D:  Hemochromogen crystals are seen in the Takayama test. It is a microchemical test
used to detect bloodstains. The stain used is Takayama reagent (sodium hydroxide, pyridine,
glucose). If bloodstain is present, pink feathery crystals of hemochromogen or reduced alkaline
hematin appear in a few minutes. The test is negative if the crystals are not formed in 3o minutes. This test is more reliable and gives positive results with old stains also but not a definitive test to   detect blood stains.",2887-1735.PNG,A,2895-1739.PNG
Q7,"Rigor mortis is well established in 12-24 hours after death. what is the order of appearance of
rigor mortis?","a)Toe to head
b)Head to toe
c)centre to periphery
d)All the body parts simultaneously","The order of appearance of rigor mortis is from head to toe.
Rigor mortis (cadaveric rigidity or death stiffening) refers to the stiffening and shortening of muscles following death. The basic sequence of the rigor mortis begins from the head and
continues downwards the body. It disappears in the same order of appearance. Nysten's rule describes the sequential onset of rigor mortis in the various muscle groups.
The muscles are affected in the given order:
• Involuntary muscles - Heart (left chamber of the heart is affected first)
• Eyelids
• Neck and lower jaw
• Face
• Chest
• upper extremities



• Abdomen
• Legs
• Fingers and toes",,B,
Q8,"A 5-year-old child has consumed overdose of iron syrup, around 6omg/kg. which among the following is contraindicated?","a)BAL
b)Deferoxamine
c)calcium EDETATE
d)DTPA","The clinical scenario points to iron toxicity, which is managed with deferoxamine (also known as desferrioxamine), calcium EDETATE and DTPA whereas Dimercaprol, also known as BAL   (British anti-Lewisite), is used to treat arsenic, mercury poisoning, and wilson's disease.
Large amounts of ferrous salts can be fatal in children. Initial symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal bleeding. In severe cases, cyanosis and hyperventilation   due to acidosis can develop. This can sometimes be followed by an asymptomatic phase. Later,
hypoglycemia and hepatic and renal failure can develop. Pyloric stenosis and gastric scarring can develop due to its corrosive nature. ultimately, if left untreated, the child can die.
The gastric contents can be used for an iron color test to estimate the iron concentration in
plasma. As iron tablets are radiopaque, an X-ray can be used to assess the number of pills taken. Deferoxamine (option B) is selectively used as a chelating agent to manage cases of acute iron
poisoning, hemochromatosis, and patients with iron overload from repetitive blood transfusions. Desferrioxamine can be administered intramuscularly, intravenously, or subcutaneously but not  orally. Side effects include pruritus, wheals, rash, and anaphylaxis.
Deferiprone and deferasirox are other oral iron chelators used to treat iron overload in
thalassemia patients.
other options:
option C : Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is used for acute lead poisoning. It is not
suitable for the management of chronic lead poisoning. The calcium salt of EDTA can be used in the management of heavy metal poisonings where the metal in question has a higher affinity for  EDTA than calcium in vivo. Because of their lower affinity to EDTA, mercury and arsenic cannot be effectively chelated.
option D : Diethylenetriamene pentaacetate (DTPA) is a chelating agents which works by binding and holding on to radioactive materials (plutonium, americium, and curium) and poisons like
iron. Calcium DTPA is well tolerated and effective as desferrioxamine in mobilising iron than zinc DTPA.",,A,
Q9,"A sexual assault survivor had to testify in court and an in-camera trial was conducted. what is an ""in-camera"" trial?","a)open court proceedings
b)closed court proceedings
c)proceedings recorded on camera

Q10,A 36-year-old man died following a RTA. The doctor informed the police officer and shifted the body to the mortuary. Autopsy in this case will be conducted at the request of_______,"a)Forensic expert
b)Investigating police officer
c)Defense lawyer
d)prosecution lawyer","In the case of the 36-year-old man who died following an RTA, the autopsy will be conducted at the request of the investigating police officer.
According to BNSS Section 194 (Section 174 crpc), a police inquest is the standard procedure for   investigating unnatural deaths in India. This process is typically carried out by a police officer, not below the rank of Senior Head constable, who is responsible for conducting a preliminary inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death.
During the police inquest, the investigating officer visits the scene of the incident, examines the
body, and documents any visible injuries or signs of trauma. The officer’s report will detail these    findings and assess whether the death appears to be suicidal, homicidal, accidental, or suspicious. If the situation warrants, the body will be sent for a postmortem examination to be conducted by a qualified medical professional to determine the exact cause of death.
In certain cases, a magistrate inquest [BNSS 196 (Section 176 crpc)] may be conducted instead of, or in addition to, a police inquest. This is particularly true in cases involving deaths under special  circumstances, such as lock-up deaths, deaths while in police custody, custodial rape, death in a
psychiatric hospital, dowry death or deaths resulting from police actions. The magistrate inquest    is carried out by a District Magistrate, Subdivisional Magistrate, or another authorized magistrate, and involves a more formal judicial inquiry into the cause of death.",,B,
Q11,"A person comes to emergency after consumption of a substance, the form and dose of which is not known to the relatives. The patient has tachypnea and hypotension. on metabolic
assessment, high anion gap metabolic acidosis is noted with hypocalcemia. what is the diagnosis?","a)Methyl alcohol
b)Ethylene glycol
c)Datura
d)Digoxin","The patient's presentation of tachypnea, hypotension, high anion gap metabolic acidosis, and hypocalcemia, is suggestive of ethylene glycol poisoning.
Ethylene glycol is a clear, colourless, and odourless liquid commonly used as an antifreeze. It is known for its bitter-sweet taste and is absorbed mainly through ingestion rather than skin
contact. upon ingestion, ethylene glycol is metabolized in the liver to several toxic metabolites, including glycolic acid and oxalic acid, which contribute to its harmful effects.
Initially, ethylene glycol poisoning can cause symptoms such as vomiting, lethargy, and ataxia,
progressing to severe effects including tachycardia, tachypnea, and circulatory collapse within
12-24 hours. As the condition progresses, typically within one to three days, patients may
experience hypocalcemia, oliguria, tubular necrosis, and acute kidney injury (AKI). A notable
feature of ethylene glycol poisoning is the formation of calcium oxalate crystals in the urine, which can lead to renal failure.
The postmortem findings often include cerebral edema, chemical meningoencephalitis, and
significant damage to the liver and kidneys. oxalate crystals may be observed in the brain, spinal cord, and kidneys, further confirming the diagnosis.
For treatment, immediate measures include gastric lavage, activated charcoal, and administration of ethanol or 4-methyl pyrazole (fomepizole), which inhibit the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase to  prevent further metabolism of ethylene glycol into toxic compounds. Additional treatments such    as intravenous sodium bicarbonate and calcium gluconate are used to address metabolic acidosis  and hypocalcemia, respectively, while hemodialysis is indicated in severe cases with significant
renal impairment or high serum ethylene glycol concentrations.
other options:
option A: Methyl alcohol (Methanol) and Ethylene glycol poisoning can present very similarly.   However, the key distinguishing feature of methanol poisoning is the presence of eye symptoms (as opposed to kidney damage in ethylene glycol) - like blurring of vision/loss of vision due to
retinal damage by formate metabolites.
Methanol--Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) → Formaldehyde → (Retinal damage)
Ethylene glycol--Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) → Glyoxyaldehyde → (Kidney damage)
option C: Datura is used as a stupefying poison before robbery, kidnapping, and rape. The active ingredients include the anticholinergic alkaloids atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine. The
seeds or other parts of the plant can be ingested or smoked. Toxic manifestations include
dilatation of pupils along with loss of accommodation, diplopia, dryness of the mouth and throat, unquenchable thirst, dysphagia, dilatation of cutaneous blood vessels, dysarthria, drunken gait,    delirium, drowsiness and death due to respiratory or cardiac failure.
option D: Digoxin toxicity can occur in the elderly and patients with renal impairment and presents with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, confusion, blurred vision with a characteristic    yellowing of vision (compared to the “starry night” painting), and irregular heart rhythms.
overdose and resultant arrhythmias are managed with anti-digoxin Fab fragments (Digibind or Digifab).",,B,
Q12,A patient presented to the opD with findings as shown below. Identify the type of poisoning in this patient.,"a)chronic malnutrition
b)copper
c)Mercury
d)Arsenic","The image showing the raindrop pattern of skin pigmentation and the Aldrich-Mees lines on the fingernails of the patient are suggestive of chronic arsenic poisoning.
Arsenic in its metallic form is not poisonous, but when it unites with oxygen, it forms poisonous vapours of arsenic trioxide. These interfere with cellular respiration, damaging mitochondrial
enzymes. It is present in fruit sprays, copper and gold mineral deposits, weed killers, insecticides, rat poisons, wallpapers, and artificial flowers.
There are several types of arsenic poisoning:
• Fulminant - when massive doses are rapidly absorbed, death occurs in 1–3 hours due to shock and peripheral vascular failure.
• Gastrointestinal - This is the most common form of acute poisoning and resembles bacterial food poisoning. There is a constriction in the throat and difficulty in swallowing. The stools are
dark-colored, foul smelling, and bloody initially and later take a colorless odorless watery form similar to the rice-water stools of cholera.
• chronic poisoning - It occurs due to repeated daily exposure. The main features include finely
mottled, raindrop pigmentation that appears on the skin of flexures, temples, eyelids, and neck. In prolonged contact, hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles occurs along with the development of a    transverse white line in the fingernails called the Aldrich-Mees lines.
Tests to detect arsenic poisoning:
• 24-hour urinary excretion of arsenic
• Detection of arsenic by atomic absorption spectroscopy
• Marsh and Reinsch's tests are now considered obsolete.
The preferred treatment option is freshly prepared hydrated ferric oxide, which converts toxic arsenic to non-toxic ferric arsenite. DMSA (Succimer), British anti-Lewisite (BAL), and
penicillamine can also be used.


other options:



option A: chronic malnutrition leads to distinct skin and nail changes depending on the specific condition. In kwashiorkor, there is flaky paint dermatosis with reddish-brown scaling, thin and
sparse hair featuring a ""flag sign,"" and soft nails. In marasmus, patients exhibit dry, wrinkled skin, slow-growing brittle hair, and nails, often accompanied by growth retardation.
option B: Acute copper poisoning is due to inhalation of a large amount of copper dust or fumes, which leads to upper respiratory tract irritation, conjunctivitis, and sinus irritation. contact with  the skin may lead to irritant contact dermatitis and a greenish-blue discolouration of the skin.
In chronic poisoning, symptoms mostly resemble those of wilson's disease, mainly including gradual anaemia, peripheral neuritis, and muscle atrophy.
option c: Acute mercury poisoning presents with corrosive bronchitis with fever, chills, and
dyspnea, which may progress to pulmonary edema and fibrosis. The symptom profile in children is similar to that of kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome). chronic exposure  to elemental mercury leads to a classic triad of gingivitis, tremors, and neuropsychiatric changes.",2889-1737.PNG,D,2899-1740.PNG
Q13,The following findings were noted during the autopsy of a patient with a gunshot injury. what is the likely range of the gunshot?,"a)cannot be opined
b)Distant range
c)contact range
d)close  range","The likely range of the gunshot injury shown above is close range, characterized by a circular wound with blackening and tattooing.
To determine the range of firing, the following parameters are used:
• The entry wound size and shape
• Blast effect – Muzzle end imprint and edge eversion
• Blackening, Tattooing, singeing of hair, Abrasion collar, and Grease collar
• Hair should be preserved to determine the range of firing which can be examined for
carbonization/desiccation in close range, also from lead deposition around the wound to assess the range of firing.
Blackening occurs due to the deposit of smoke and can be removed with a wet cloth. This can be seen up to around 15 cm of firing. whereas, tattooing occurs due to the deposition of unburnt
powder particles and are difficult to remove. They are also called stippling or peppering. This is seen up to 5o cm of firing.
Abrasion collar: Gyroscopic movement of the bullet, the skin's elasticity, and the grease and dirt    particles on the bullet's surface are the major causative factors of abrasion and grease collar. They are seen on the skin around the wound of entry at all ranges. Depending on the angle of entry
made by the bullet, i.e.
• A perpendicular entry of the bullet develops the abrasion collar of a rounded shape.
• An acute angular entry of the bullet develops the abrasion collar of an oblique or oval shape.
• some contusion present in the abraded collar is known as contusion collar
Grease collar: Mostly seen on the clothing and is seen as a black deposit, sharply outlined as if printed (better seen on light colour clothes and fair-skinned individuals). Its medicolegal
importance is that it helps derive information such as entry wound and direction of firing.",2889-1736.PNG,D,
Q14,"A large number of people who consumed cheap alcohol presented to the emergency
department with abdominal pain, confusion, and decreased vision. Methyl alcohol level in
blood was detected to be around 2o mg %. on assessment which of the following metabolites will be found in blood?","a)Glycolic acid and Glyoxylic acid
b)Formic acid and lactic acid
c)Glycolic acid and lactic acid
d)oxalic acid and formic acid","The given case scenario is suggestive of methanol poisoning. In these cases, formic acid and lactic acid are typically the metabolites found in the blood.
Methyl alcohol, or methanol, is commonly present in cheap or illicit alcoholic beverages due to its lower cost compared to ethyl alcohol. These inexpensive alcohols may be improperly distilled or    adulterated, leading to methanol contamination. when ingested, methanol is absorbed into the
bloodstream and metabolized by the liver, where it is first converted into formaldehyde, a highly toxic intermediate. Formaldehyde is then further oxidized into formic acid, which is responsible  for many of the severe symptoms associated with methanol poisoning.
The accumulation of formic acid leads to significant metabolic acidosis, which manifests as
confusion, abdominal pain, and visual disturbances. The visual symptoms can be particularly
severe, including blurred vision or even blindness, due to the toxic effects of formic acid on the
optic nerve. In addition to formic acid, methanol's disruption of normal oxidative enzyme activity results in the buildup of lactic acid, contributing further to acidosis. Brain edema, acute renal
failure, and severe metabolic derangement are also seen.
The principles of treatment for this condition predominantly involve using fomepizole or ethanol   to inhibit the metabolic conversion of these relatively non-toxic alcohols to their toxic metabolites.",,B,
Q15,"In the case of drowning, following autopsy, an organism was isolated from the water present in the internal organs. which of the following is true regarding the isolated organism?","a)present only in the bone marrow
b)Dried outer wall contains silica and chlorophyll
c)It is a microscopic unicellular bacteria
d)It is not heat and acid resistant","Diatoms enter pulmonary circulation on antemortem drowning. Diatoms are a class of
microscopic unicellular algae (option C) found suspended in most natural waters. Their cell walls are impregnated with silica, chlorophyll, diatomic, and a brown pigment.
The drowning fluid and the particles in it, e.g., diatoms and plankton, pass from the ruptured
alveolar wall into lymph channels and pulmonary veins and thus enter the left heart. only a live     body with circulation could transport diatoms from the lungs to the brain, bone marrow, liver and other viscera, and skeletal muscle. They are also found in bile and urine. Bone marrow is highly
suitable and reliable.
Isolation of diatoms involves acid digestion of tissue - bone marrow, lung, blood, and kidneys with subsequent centrifugation and the final residue is aspirated and examined for diatoms, which are   birefringent, using dark ground illumination. A water sample is collected at the time of body
retrieval in a clean container and the similarity of different species of diatom is compared.
Diatoms are both heat and acid-resistant (option D).
• The presence of diatoms in the lung, brain, liver, kidneys, and bone marrow (option A) of the femur (best site for analysis) or humerus is suggestive proof of antemortem drowning.
• since diatoms resist putrefaction, the diatom test may have some value in the examination of decomposed bodies.
• The test is negative in postmortem submersion and in dry drowning.



Diatoms are ubiquitous in the environment and may enter circulation via the gastrointestinal tract (as contaminants of foods)or via the respiratory tract (which are present in the air). Still, the
diatom test is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of typical drowning.",2890-1738.PNG,B,
Q16,"A pregnant female comes to a gynaecologist, who sends her for UsG. on UsG, twin
pregnancy was noted with about a one-month difference in the age of fetuses. which of the following is true with regard to this patient?","a)superfecundation
b)superfetation
c)supposititious child
d)posthumous child","The above phenomenon is known as superfetation. It occurs when there is fertilization of 2
different ova released in different menstrual cycles. The consequence is two children are born at the same time and one of them might be mature while another might be immature or two fully   developed fetuses are born at intervals ranging from one to three months apart.
ovulation usually stops with the onset of pregnancy, but in a few individuals, ovulation may be possible till the first trimester, after which the decidual cavity is obliterated. The fertilization of the newly released ovum in a woman who is already pregnant may take place following coitus.
other options:
option A: Superfecundation is the fertilization of 2 different ova in the same menstrual cycle by separate acts of coitus. Heteropaternal superfecundation is used to refer to instances of two
different males fathering fraternal twins. This leads to the possibility of twins also being
half-siblings. This may raise doubts regarding adultery and infidelity.
option C: A supposititious child is also known as a fictitious child. In such cases, a woman
pretends to be pregnant and substitutes a living child as her own, or may substitute a male child    for her female child, or abortion. This is done to claim property. This can be identified by verifying the signs of pregnancy and delivery in the woman and by DNA fingerprinting.
option D: A posthumous child is a child born alive after the death of his or her father who was conceived before the death of the father.",,B,
Q17,"A 32-year-old woman G3p2L2 came to you in active labor. The labour process was arrested at around cervical dilatation of 8 cm. she was counselled regarding the need for an emergency    cesarean section. The baby was delivered by cesarean section and was doing well but the
mother developed intractable postpartum hemorrhage. conservative measures were tried   initially but failed. Emergency hysterectomy was done as a life-saving procedure. what are the medicolegal implications of this situation?","a)patient could sue the doctor for removing her uterus
b)Hysterectomy was done as a life saving procedure, so the doctor is legally protected
c)consent can be taken from the patient on oT table
d)counsellling of patient and attendants is not needed","According to BNS Section 3o (IPC 92), a doctor is permitted to perform life-saving procedures on a patient with life-threatening injuries. For example, in this case where conservative measures
have failed to control intractable postpartum haemorrhage, an emergency hysterectomy can be performed without obtaining consent in order to save the patient's life.
The guiding principle is whether the delay in treatment in order to obtain consent would result in harm to the patient. This is the doctrine of anticipation. under some circumstances like
emergencies, informed consent may be neither possible nor necessary.
BNS Section 3o (IPC 92) states that nothing is an offence by reason of any harm which it may
cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without that person’s consent, if  the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of him from    whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit.",,B,
Q18,"A 3o-year-old man who was found dead was brought in for autopsy. The doctor notices a
greyish-white waxy layer over the body with preserved facial features. which of the following statements is true concerning adipocere formation?","a)It occurs in hot and dry temperatures
b)It occurs in cold temperatures
c)It is a type of body preservation with saponification of fats
d)occurs within few hours of death","The given scenario indicates adipocere formation, which is a late postmortem change where body fats undergo saponification through anaerobic hydrolysis and hydrogenation, resulting in a waxy  substance. Therefore, the correct answer is that it is a type of body preservation with
saponification of fats.
Adipocere formation or corpse wax, is a late sign of death, that occurs days to months after death. A wax-like organic substance is formed by the anaerobic hydrolysis or hydrogenation of fat in
tissues. It has a greyish-white appearance with a distinctive offensive or sweetish smell.
Adipocere formation varies widely, taking as little as three weeks in temperate regions during   summer, but typically requires several months for significant changes. In rare cases, the entire body may be affected, with complete conversion of an adult limb taking three to six months.
Medicolegal importance is as follows:
• It is the surest sign of death
• It gives a rough estimate of the time since death
• The cause of death can be identified.
• In the face, the features are well preserved and therefore used in identification.
postmortem changes are classified based on time:
• Immediate signs of death (at the time of somatic or clinical death):
• Insensibility and loss of voluntary power
• cessation of respiration
• cessation of circulation
• Early signs of death (cellular death that is observed in the first 12 to 24 hours of death):
• pallor and loss of elasticity of the skin
• Eye changes
• primary flaccidity of muscles
• Algor mortis/postmortem cooling
• postmortem lividity/suggillation
• Rigor mortis
• Late signs of death:
• putrefaction
• Adipocere
• Mummification",,C,
