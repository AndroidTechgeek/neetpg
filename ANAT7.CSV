Q2,Identify the cell marked in the histological image of the cerebellum shown below :,"a) purkinje cells
b) Basket cells
c) Golgi cells
d) Granule cell","The cells marked in the above histological image are purkinje cells.
characteristics of purkinje cells:
• purkinje cells are the flask-shaped cells present in the purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum.
• The cells are evenly spaced and are arranged in a single layer.
• A dendrite arises from the neck of each flask-shaped cell, which passes upward to enter the molecular layer, which then branches extensively to form a dendritic tree.
• The axon of each cell passes downwards, crosses the granular cell layer to enter the white matter.
• Axons of purkinje cells are the only efferents of the cerebellar cortex.
• The initial segment of the axon receives synaptic contacts from basket cell axons.
• The main axon terminates in one of the cerebellar or vestibular nuclei.
• purkinje cells are inhibitory and use GABA as their neurotransmitter.
pathological significance:
• Negri bodies in rabies, are usually found as eosinophilic, cytoplasmic inclusions in the neurons of the hippocampus and purkinje cells.
• Loss of purkinje cells and granule cells is seen in ataxia-telangiectasia.
• In patients with subacute cerebellar degeneration, there is the destruction of purkinje cells. some patients show circulating pcA1 antibody (antiyo) against purkinje cells.
• purkinje cells and neurons in pyramidal cell layers of hippocampus and cerebral cortex are the most sensitive neurons to hypoxia, and are likely to be damaged in cases of global cerebral ischemia.",24-12.PNG,A,
Q3,which of the following is not used for the identification of the facial nerve trunk?,"a) Retrograde dissection from distal branch
b) Tragal pointer
c) Inferior belly of omohyoid muscle
d) posterior belly of digastric","The inferior belly of the omohyoid muscle is not used as an anatomical landmark for the identification of the facial nerve trunk.
There are two methods for localization of the facial nerve trunk:
1. Anterograde method: The facial nerve trunk is identified based on the anatomical landmarks after it exits from the stylomastoid foramen. This includes:
• Tragal pointer/conley's pointer - It is the inferior portion of the cartilaginous canal. The facial nerve trunk lies 1 cm deep and inferior to its tip.
• posterior belly of digastric - The facial nerve lies superior to the upper border of the muscle.
• squamotympanic fissure - It is a fissure in the temporal bone, which runs from TMJ to the tympanic cavity. The facial nerve runs through this fissure.
• styloid process - The facial nerve lies superficial to it.
• Mastoid process - upon drilling it, the nerve is identified proximally.
2. Retrograde method: The main branches of the facial nerve trunk are identified and are then traced proximally until the main tunk is identified. some branches used for tracing the facial nerve trunk include:
• Buccal branch - It lies in relation to the parotid gland.
• Marginal mandibular branch - It lies in relation to the facial vessels.",176-167.PNG,C,165-158.PNG

Q7,which of the following structures prevents the upward extension of thyroid swelling through its attachment to the thyroid cartilage?,"a) pretracheal fascia
b) sternothyroid
c) Thyrohyoid membrane
d) Ligament of berry","sternothyroid and sternohyoid prevent the upward extension of the thyroid swelling through its attachment to the thyroid cartilage.
pretracheal fascia encloses the thyroid gland and is attached to the larynx. This attachment is responsible for the movement of the enlarged thyroid gland on deglutition.
The thyrohyoid membrane is a fibro-elastic ligament, which arises from the superior margin of the thyroid cartilage, and gets attached to the hyoid bone. It facilitates the upward movement of the larynx during swallowing.
The ligament of Berry, also called the suspensory ligament extends from the cricoid cartilage to the thyroid. Its attachment prevents the thyroid gland from sinking down into the mediastinum.",,B,168-161.PNG
Q8,A patient presented with the extension of Mcp joint and flexion of Ip joints. which muscle is affected?,"a) Extensor digitorum
b) Interossei and lumbricals
c) Abductor pollicis
d) Abductor pollicis brevis","The lumbricals and interossei muscles are affected.
The lumbricals and interossei muscles through their attachments to the dorsal digital expansions, cause:
• Flexion of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints
• Extension of the interphalangeal (IP) joints
In cases of ulnar nerve injury, these muscles may get atrophied leading to the extension of MCP joints and flexion of IP joints.
Note: The ulnar nerve innervates all the intrinsic muscles of the hand, except for
• First and second lumbrical
• Abductor pollicis brevis
• opponens pollicis
• Part of flexor pollicis brevis",,B,
Q9,Meiosis occurs in:,"a) Adrenal
b) Adult ovary
c) prepubertal testis
d) Hypothalamus","Meiosis occurs in the adult ovary.
Meiosis takes place only in germ cells and results in the formation of haploid gametes. Meiosis requires two cell divisions, meiosis I and meiosis II, to reduce the number of chromosomes to the haploid number of 23.
option C: spermatogenesis begins at puberty. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) remain dormant in the testis until puberty. At puberty, PGCs differentiate into spermatogonial stem cells. These spermatogonial stem cells then give rise to spermatogonia which marks the beginning of spermatogenesis.
options A and D: These are somatic cells that only undergo mitosis and not meiosis.",,B,
Q10,The long left recurrent laryngeal nerve is due to the persistence of which arch artery?,"a) 3rd arch
b) 4th arch
c) 5th arch
d) 6th arch","The long left recurrent laryngeal nerve is due to the persistence of the left 6th arch artery.
During the development, the laryngeal nerves initially arise below the 6th arch artery and cross here to innervate the intrinsic muscles of the larynx. As the larynx moves cranially relative to the aortic arch arteries, the recurrent laryngeal nerves on the right and left sides are caught under the 6th arch arteries.
on the right side, the distal 6th arch artery disappears. since there is no 5th arch artery, the right recurrent laryngeal nerve is caught under the 4th arch artery which becomes the future right subclavian artery.
on the left side, the 6th arch artery persists, which develops into ductus arteriosus, which later forms ligamentum arteriosum. Due to the persistence of the 6th arch artery, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve is caught under it and therefore, has a relatively long course.",,D,

Q13,Ligation of common hepatic artery will impair blood supply in:,"a) Right gastric artery and right gastroepiploic artery
b) Right gastric and left gastric artery
c) Right gastroepiploic and short gastric vessels
d) Right gastric and short gastric vessels","Ligation of the common hepatic artery will cause impairment in the blood supply through its branches i.e right gastric artery and right gastroepiploic artery.
Blood supply of the stomach:
The arterial supply of the stomach is contributed exclusively by the branches of the celiac trunk. They are:
• Left gastric artery - supplies the lesser curvature of the stomach
• splenic artery- This further divides into:
• short gastric arteries- supplies the fundus of the stomach
• Left gastroepiploic artery- supplies the greater curvature of the stomach
• common hepatic artery, which gives the following branches
• Right gastric artery- supplies the lesser curvature of the stomach
• Gastroduodenal artery- Right gastroepiploic artery arises from this and supplies the greater curvature of the stomach.",,A,171-163.PNG
Q14,The type of joint marked in the image below is _________:,"a) syndesmosis
b) synarthrosis
c) synchondrosis
d) synovial","The joint marked in the above image is the costotransverse joint, which is a synovial type of joint.
The various types of joints in the thoracic wall include:
sternocostal joints: These are the joints between the costal cartilages of the first seven ribs and the sternum.
• The joint between the 1st costal cartilage and manubrium is a fibrocartilaginous joint (synarthrosis).
• The joints between the 2nd to 7th costal cartilages and the sternum are synovial joints.
The interchondral joint between the costal cartilages of the 9th and 1oth ribs is never synovial and is usually absent.

Q15,Identify the sign shown in the image below:,"a) popeye sign
b) Hill-sachs sign
c) Griesinger sign
d) Rising sun sign","The sign shown in the above image is the popeye sign, which occurs due to the rupture of the tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii.
on flexing the elbow, the characteristic deformity appears due to the bulging of the muscle belly caused by the contraction of the unrestrained muscles.
option B: Hill-sachs sign refers to a defect in the postero-lateral surface of the humeral head due to repeated impact against anterior glenoid rim. It is a common complication of Anterior shoulder dislocation.
option c: Griesinger sign refers to oedema of the postauricular soft tissues overlying the mastoid process as a result of thrombosis of the mastoid emissary vein. It is a complication of acute mastoiditis.

Q16,A patient presented with an enlarged inguinal lymph node. The most likely primary cause is,"a) Testicular cancer
b) Anal cancer
c) sigmoid colon cancer
d) prostate cancer","The most likely primary cause of an enlarged inguinal lymph node is anal cancer.
Lymphatics from the anal canal distal to the dentate line (anal margin) drains into the inguinal lymph nodes. Hence, anal cancer arising distal to dentate line can cause enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. Lymphatics proximal to the dentate line (anal canal) drains into internal iliac lymph nodes through superior rectal lymphatics.
option A: In testicular cancer, lymphatic spread occurs to the paraaortic lymph nodes.
option C: In sigmoid colon cancer, lymphatic spread occurs to the regional lymph node and then to the central lymph node.
option D: In prostate cancer, lymphatic spread occurs to the:
• Lymph nodes beside the internal iliac vein and in the hollow of the sacrum
• External iliac lymph nodes.",,B,
Q17,Identify the type of cartilage shown in the image below:,"a) Hyaline cartilage
b) Elastic cartilage
c) Articular cartilage
d) Fibrocartilage","The above image shows an elastic cartilage.
The elastic cartilage, like the hyaline cartilage, contains individual or small groups of chondrocytes that are surrounded by type II collagen fibrils. However, it differs from hyaline cartilage in that, much of the interterritorial matrix consists of fine yellow elastic fibres containing elastin protein.
on microscopy, elastic cartilage consists of:
• chondrocytes within lacunae
• Elastic fibres in the matrix
• perichondrium with outer fibrous layer and the inner cellular layer",162-156.PNG,B,nan
