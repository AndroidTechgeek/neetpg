Q3,"A 56-year-old man presents with fatigue, pallor, and abdominal pain. He reports memory loss and reveals that he works at a battery recycling plant. on examination, a noticeable foot drop  in both lower extremities is seen. Laboratory testing shows elevated blood lead levels. which   enzyme is affected in the given scenario?","a)Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase
b)uroporphyrinogen III
c)uroporphyrinogen I
d)pyruvate dehydrogenase","The given scenario is suggestive of chronic lead poisoning, and the enzyme affected is aminolevulinic acid dehydratase or ALA dehydratase.
Lead is a heavy metal, which mainly acts by depressing the enzymes in heme synthesis, blocking the enzyme aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and inhibiting ferrochelatase.
chronic lead poisoning also referred to as plumbism or saturnism occurs following inhalation of lead dust or vapors that arise as a result of burning of paints, batteries, smouldering, glass
blowing, and polishing.
Features of lead poisoning:
• Facial pallor, which is the earliest and most consistent sign
• Anemia
• Burtonian line, or the lead line, is seen on the gums as a blue line. It occurs as a result of lead  sulphide formation, which is deposited as granules in the upper jaw at the junction of the teeth.
• Abdominal colic, constipation
• Lead palsy is a late manifestation, commonly seen in adults and is characterized by numbness, hyperesthesia, and muscle cramps, followed by weakness. other features like foot drop, wrist
drop, and fatigue may be seen.
• Lead encephalopathy is characterized by vomiting, convulsions, headache, insomnia, visual disturbances, and irritability.
Diagnosis is mainly by history and clinical findings. Increased urinary lead and porphyrin
excretion are suggestive of chronic lead poisoning. Radiograph, erythrocyte porphyrin assays, and basophilic stippling in the peripheral smear are also useful.
prophylaxis in the form of proper ventilation, personal hygiene, periodic medical examination,
supplementation of calcium-rich diet and sulphuric acid in the water, and weekly saline purgative in factory works is useful.
Management includes British Anti-Lewisite, or BAL, for severe acute poisoning, with and without encephalopathy; ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) for moderate poisoning;
and D-penicillamine in mild cases.

behavioral changes. The doctor notices that there is a loss of eyebrows on the lateral side. He  then comes to a conclusion by examining the nails. what is the type of poisoning in this case?","a)Thallium
b)Arsenic
c)Mercury
d)Lead","The given scenario of hair loss, loss of eyebrows on the lateral side along with behavioral and nail changes point to thallium poisoning.
Thallium poisoning occurs due to an overdose or idiosyncrasy. Thallium sulfate and thallium     acetate are the two salts of thallium used in dyes, in the glass industry, and as rodenticides and pesticides.
Mild cases of poisoning have features of joint pain, loss of appetite, and drowsiness. severe cases   present with colic, vomiting, muscle pain, convulsions, psychosis, tremors, delirium, and coma are seen in severe cases. Hair loss is seen after 2 weeks and a characteristic feature is loss of the outer thirds of the eyebrows. Mees lines are seen on the nails. Maculopapular rashes in a butterfly
pattern on the face are characteristic.
In chronic poisoning, alopecia, skin rashes, peripheral neuropathy, and mental confusion are present.
Treatment is mainly by stomach wash with potassium iodide or prussian blue, activated charcoal. Hemodialysis is useful and forced diuresis can be given.

Q6,"A dead body is brought for evaluation. on post-mortem examination, a ligature that was
completely encircling the neck, horizontal, and below the level of the thyroid was seen. There was no dribbling of saliva. what is the cause of death?","a)Throttling
b)Ligature strangulation
c)Gagging
d)Hanging","The most likely cause of death in a case where the ligature is completely encircling the neck,
horizontal, and below the level of the thyroid, with no saliva dribbling, is ligature strangulation.
strangulation is a type of asphyxia where there is neck constriction without suspension of the body. The pressure on the neck is applied either by bare hands, a ligature, or by any other
instrument.
when strangulation is done by using a ligature like a constricting band or rope, it is called ligature strangulation. The constricting band is tightened by a force other than the victim's body weight. It is characterized by the ligature mark, which is transverse and completely encircles the neck below  the thyroid cartilage. There is no dribbling of saliva. Bleeding may be present in the ears, nose,
and mouth.
Ligature and manual strangulations are mostly homicidal. Marks of violence are usually seen on other parts of the body.
other options:
option A: Throttling or manual strangulation occurs due to compression of the neck by humans leading to asphyxia. Thumb impression and finger marks may be seen over the victim's neck.
option C: Gagging is a type of asphyxia due to forcible closure of the mouth by a cloth or closing the mouth and nose and is tied around the head.
option D: Hanging is characterized by an incomplete and oblique ligature mark on the neck. It is usually seen higher, between the chin and larynx. saliva often dribbles from the mouth.",,B,
