Q1,A 6-year-old boy came with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections. Imaging was done and is shown below. what is the diagnosis?,"a)vesicoureteric reflux
b)urinary bladder diverticulum
c)urinary bladder hernia
d)vesicocolic fistula","In the given scenario of a 6-year-old boy with recurrent urinary tract infections and the
micturating cystourethrogram showing a dilated ureter, the likely diagnosis is vesicoureteric reflux.
Vesicoureteric or vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a condition in which there is a retrograde urinary flow from the bladder to the ureter and kidney. It is usually congenital.
VUR can cause urinary stasis and lead to urinary tract infection (UTI). It also predisposes to
pyelonephritis, which can lead to renal scarring due to parenchymal inflammation. This is known as reflux nephropathy.
Micturating cystogram is used to confirm the VUR. VUR can be graded based on the appearance of the urinary tract on the micturating cystogram. It is as follows:
Grade 1- reflux into the ureter
Grade 2- reflux into the ureter and renal pelvis
Grade 3- mild to moderate dilatation on IVU along with reflux and mild blunting of calices Grade 4- blunting of fornices
Grade 5- absent papillary impressions





Grades 1-3 resolve spontaneously. surgical management is done when acute pyelonephritis recurs in spite of antibiotic therapy or if severe reflux is associated with a defect that can be corrected
surgically.
other options:
option B: urinary bladder diverticula occurs due to pressure changes in the bladder leading to the formation of saccules that may protrude through the bladder wall. It is more common in elderly     males &gt;5o years and is usually asymptomatic or not infected. symptoms may occur due to
associated urinary obstruction, recurrent infection, or pyelonephritis. They are diagnosed incidentally on cystoscopy or ultrasonography.
option c: urinary bladder hernia is an uncommon condition characterized by herniation of
the urinary bladder or ureter into the inguinal canal, scrotum, or femoral canal. urinary
symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, nocturia, and hematuria can be seen. Retrograde cystography is the best technique to image a bladder hernia.
option D: vesicocolic fistula is an abnormal communication between the bladder and the colon. As a result of this, the fecal matter may enter the bladder. Diverticulitis is the most common
cause. Bubbles in the urine, pain, hematuria, and recurrent uTI can occur. cystoscopy reveals edema and gas bubbles. The fistula can be seen in a cystogram.",4994-3120.PNG,A,5011-3141.PNG
Q2,"A 45-year-old female patient underwent thyroidectomy. Three days after the surgery, she
developed perioral numbness. which of the following investigations need to be done for her?","a)Free T3, T4
b)T3, T4, Thyroid-stimulating hormone
c)Radioiodine scan
d)calcium, phosphate and parathormone levels","calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels should be done in this patient to evaluate hypoparathyroidism secondary to thyroidectomy.
Hypoparathyroidism is a common complication of thyroid surgery. It is temporary and usually    lasts for 4-6 weeks. Hypoparathyroidism following thyroid surgery can be diagnosed when there are decreased serum calcium and/ or PTH levels, or if there is symptomatic hypocalcemia.
The features of hypocalcemia are circumoral paresthesia, and paresthesia of the neck, fingers, and toes. Muscle twitching, weakness of the forearm, hand, foot, and carpopedal spasms can be



seen. A carpal spasm can be induced by inflating a blood pressure cuff to 2o mmHg above the
systolic blood pressure for 3 minutes. This is known as Trousseau's sign. chvostek sign wherein   twitching of facial muscles is demonstrated by tapping above the angle of the jaw. It is due to the stimulation of the branches of the facial nerve.
EcG shows prolonged QT interval.
Management of acute and symptomatic hypocalcemia is by giving 1o mL of intravenous 1o% calcium gluconate over 5 minutes.",,D,
Q3,"A patient presented with blunt trauma to the abdomen. on evaluation, liver injury was noted for which primary repair was done. coagulation function was monitored intraoperatively,
using the method shown below. what is the method used?","a)Thromboelastography
b)plethysmography
c)sonography
d)Elastography","In the case of liver injury, intraoperative monitoring of coagulation function is done
by thromboelastography which is shown in the given image.
Thromboelastography (TEG) is a non-invasive test that quantifies the ability of whole blood to
form a clot. It is useful in intraoperative coagulation status assessment. The dynamic changes in     the viscoelastic properties of a blood sample during the clotting can be detected and quantified by  thromboelastography. underlying coagulation deficiencies show different shapes in the TEG. They are shown in the image as follows


Advantages ofthromboelastography:
•
Blood coagulability, including coagulation cascade, platelet function, and fibrinolysis can be assessed.
•
It is a simple bedside test
•
can diagnose coagulopathic bleeding




•
can be used as a guide in transfusion therapy and decrease the use of blood products
•
can detect dynamic changes in blood coagulation during resuscitation
•
predict the clinical efficacy of therapeutic agents affecting blood coagulability
other options:
option B: plethysmography is a semiquantitative method to measure segmental blood flow and
velocity in the carotid and peripheral vascular systems. It is safe, inexpensive and easy to use. It is useful in the diagnosis of vascular disease.
option c: sonography or ultrasound is a cheap and easily available imaging method. It is used as   a first-line imaging method to assess liver, biliary, renal tract, obstetric, and gynecological disease. It is also useful in guiding needle placement during interventional procedures. Ligaments, tendon  and muscle injuries can also be studied by an ultrasound.
option D: Elastography is a newer imaging modality, which detects the changes in elasticity of
tissues. It is based on the concept that the pathological process alters the elastic properties of
tissue. It is useful in differentiating malignant and benign breast neoplasms, identifying traumatic changes in the muscles and tendons, helping to decide the biopsy site accurately, assess liver
fibrosis and steatosis.",4995-3121.PNG,A,5011-3141-1.png
Q4,A 59-year-old lady presents with a progressive painless lump in the breast. what is the cause for the following skin change?,"a)Infiltration of subdermal lymphatics
b)Infiltration of lactiferous duct
c)Involvement of cooper's ligament
d)spread of tumor to anterior chest wall","The image shows the peau d'orange appearance and it occurs due to the infiltration of the subdermal lymphatics.
peau d'orange appearance is a skin change in which the skin of the breast appears like that of an orange. It is due to cutaneous lymphatic edema caused by dermal lymphatic infiltration by
malignant cells. It is seen in several conditions such as:
• inflammatory carcinoma of the breast
• mastitis
• chronic abscess
• following breast surgery or radiation
other options:
option B: Infiltration of lactiferous duct leads to nipple retraction.
option c: Involvement of cooper's ligament leads to dimpling of the skin over the breast.
option D: In case of spread of the tumor to the anterior chest wall, the breast will appear fixed
and will not fall forwards when bending. on lifting the arm above the shoulder, the breast will not move upward.",4996-3123.PNG,A,
Q5,A child had a history of stab injury on the anterior abdominal wall and the image is shown below. The child is hemodynamically stable. which will be the next course of treatment?,"a)Emergency laparotomy
b)observation
c)Intravenous hydration
d)wait and watch","The next course of treatment in the given scenario of a stab injury to the abdomen with the image showing evisceration of the omentum is emergency laparotomy.
Emergency laparotomy is performed to explore and repair abdominal injuries in case of
• Hemodynamic instability
• peritonitis
• Evisceration
• Gunshot wounds
The algorithm for management of stab wounds ofthe abdomen is as follows",4996-3122.PNG,A,5014-3142.PNG
Q6,which of the following is most likely to be seen due to rupture of a saccular aneurysm?,"a)subdural hemorrhage
b)subarachnoid hemorrhage
c)Intracerebral hemorrhage
d)Hydrocephalus","subarachnoid hemorrhage is most likely to be seen due to the rupture of a saccular aneurysm.
saccular aneurysms are thin-walled outpouchings measuring 2 or 3 cm in diameter with a bright, red, translucent wall. These are mainly seen at the arterial branching points along the circle of
willis.
The absence of smooth muscle and internal elastic lamina is the main pathogenesis in saccular  aneurysms. Female sex, smoking, cocaine abuse, and family history are some other risk factors.
Genetic conditions predisposing to subarachnoid hemorrhage are:
• Adult polycystic kidney disease
• Fibromuscular dysplasia
• Neurofibromatosis type 1
• Ehler Danlos syndrome and Marfan's syndrome.



Clinically, subarachnoid hemorrhage presents with a sudden and severe headache commonly     referred to as thunderclap headache. It may be associated with seizures, unresponsiveness, and vomiting.
CT scan is the imaging method of choice. It shows blood in basal cisterns and aneurysms appear as round enhancing lesions. Management includes craniotomy and clipping or coiling by
endovascular embolization. Medical management includes fluid replacement with normal saline, oral nimodipine 6o mg every 4 hours, and supportive measures.
Hyponatremia can be a frequent complication in subarachnoid hemorrhage. The below image shows a CT of subarachnoid hemorrhage with blood in basal cisterns.


other options:
option A: subdural hemorrhage or subdural hematoma occurs mainly due to rupture of the cortical bridging veins. symptoms of raised intracranial pressure (ICP)  such as headache,    vomiting, blurring of vision, as well as focal deficits are seen.
option C: Intracerebral hemorrhages may spontaneously occur in patients with hypertension,  amyloid angiopathy, coagulation disorders, or as a complication of ischemic stroke. Headache, raised ICP, and focal neurological deficits can be present.
option D: Hydrocephalus is a condition where the cerebrospinal fluid (CsF) circulation is    obstructed or there is a failure to resorb thereby leading to an increase in CsF volume with enlargement of the ventricles. symptoms of raised ICP are seen.",,B,5015-3143.PNG
Q7,"A patient presents with sudden-onset right leg pain. An investigation was done, and the obtained image is shown below. what is the investigation?","a)Digital subtraction angiography
b)ultrasound Doppler
c)MR angiography
d)plethysmography","The image shows a triphasic pattern of the arterial waveform, which is seen in the ultrasound doppler.
Doppler ultrasound is used in diagnosing peripheral arterial disease. It uses a handheld doppler     ultrasound probe placed at an arterial site. This transmits a continuous wave. A receiver inside the probe picks up the reflected beam. The change in frequency between the reflected beam and the



transmitted beam gets converted to a pulsatile audio signal.
A normal arterial wave has a triphasic signal. A triphasic wave has three waveforms consisting of a sharp systolic wave with a forward uprise and fall, a second wave with reverse flow occurring in
diastole, and the last wave with a forward flow taking place during diastole.
Doppler ultrasound can detect moving blood. However, it does not provide information on whether the blood flow is sufficient for the maintenance of limb viability.
other options:
option A: Digital subtraction percutaneous angiography (DSA) is a procedure wherein a
radiopaque dye is usually injected percutaneously into the femoral artery. Images obtained are digitalized and the background may be removed for a clear image. It provides information on   dynamic arterial flow and can be combined with endovascular intervention if needed.
option C: plethysmography is a semi-quantitative method to measure segmental blood flow and velocity in the carotid and peripheral vascular systems.
option D: Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or MR angiography, is an imaging modality that can be used when duplex ultrasonography cannot be done or if it cannot produce a clear
image. MRA avoids ionizing radiation.",4997-3124.PNG,B,
Q8,A male patient presented with a o.3-cm nodule on the left nasolabial fold. It was excised and a pathological examination was done. The image is given below. what is the diagnosis?,"a)Basal cell carcinoma
b)Melanoma
c)squamous cell carcinoma
d)Nevus","The given clinical scenario of a nodule on the nasolabial fold and the histopathological image showing peripheral palisading is likely to be basal cell carcinoma (BCC).
Basal cell carcinoma is a slow-growing malignant tumor, with locally invasive characteristics. It affects the pilosebaceous skin.
ultraviolet radiation exposure is the strongest predisposing factor. other risk factors include exposure to arsenic, coal tar, aromatic hydrocarbons, and ionizing radiation.
It mainly affects the elderly or middle-aged men who are excessively exposed to sun, common in the age group 4o-8o and white-skinned people.
Macroscopically, it is categorized as localized and generalized. Nodular, nodulocystic (nodular and nodulocystic together account for 9o% of BCC), pigmented, and nevoid are the localized cancers    while superficial multifocal and superficial spreading, infiltrative, and cicatrizing are the
generalized types. Nodular type is described as pearly waxy nodules at the margins. A central depression with umbilication or ulceration and rolled-out edges are characteristic of BCC.
The below gross image shows pearly, rolled-out borders suggestive of basal cell carcinoma.





Histopathologic features show ovoid cells in nests with a single palisading layer. The outer layer of cells is in the active division and thus incomplete excision can lead to being more aggressive. The   below image shows the histopathology of BCC.


sites near the eye, nose, and ear and size &gt;2 cm are considered to be high risk. Direct invasion at these sites can reach the cranium.
Management is by Moh's microscopic surgery. Non-surgical measures such as topical 5-fluorouracil, and imiquimod are useful. Metastasis is extremely rare.
other options:
option B: Melanoma is a malignancy, commonly seen in young adults, arising from melanocytes    and involves the skin, mucosa, retina, and leptomeninges. Microscopically, malignant changes are seen in the basal epidermis with breach and invasion of the dermis as shown below.





option C: squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common malignant tumor, seen more
commonly in men. Microscopically, the proliferation of irregular masses of squamous epithelium is seen. The image is shown below.


option D: Nevus are aggregates of melanocytes at the dermis or dermo-epidermal junction. It can get transformed into malignant melanoma and the features suggestive of malignant
transformation are a change in size, shape, color, thickness, satellite lesions, and tingling/ itching/serosanguinous discharge.",4998-3125.PNG,A,5017-3145.PNG;5017-3144.PNG;5018-3146.PNG;5017-3145-1.png
Q9,A 45-year-old patient complained of pain in one side of the neck. she is afraid of eating food as it worsens the pain. ultrasound imaging of the salivary glands is done and shown below.  what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)sialolithiasis
b)Foreign body
c)osteoma of floor of mouth
d)cervical lymphadenopathy","The given clinical scenario of pain on one side of the neck that worsens with food and the
ultrasound image showing a stone within wharton's duct is suggestive of sialolithiasis (salivary



gland stone).
The submandibular gland has highly viscous secretions and hence forms the most common site for salivary gland stone formation. The two most common sites of stone impaction are near the punctum and the hilum of the gland where the duct bends over the mylohyoid muscle.
The patient usually presents with acute painful swelling in the submandibular region, which
is aggravated with food intake. symptoms resolve 1-2 hours after the meal is completed. on
examination, a tender and enlarged submandibular gland can be noted on bimanual examination. Pus may be seen draining from the sublingual papilla or can be expressed on bimanual palpation   of the gland.
Most submandibular stones are radio-opaque and visible in radiographs. stones of size &lt;4 mm are removed via a dormia basket using endoscopic or ultrasound-guided methods under local
anesthesia. stones of size &gt;4 mm are broken first using intracorporeal or extracorporeal lithotripsy and then removed using a dormia basket.
submandibular gland excision is done only when minimally invasive techniques have failed or there is evidence of a salivary gland tumor.
Nerves at risk during the removal of the submandibular gland:
• the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve
• the lingual nerve
• the hypoglossal nerve",4999-3127.PNG,A,5019-3147.PNG;5019-3147-1.png
Q10,A delayed intravenous urogram of a patient is given below. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)pelviureteric junction obstruction
b)putty kidney
c)staghorn calculus
d)cystic kidney","The delayed intravenous urogram (IVU) of the patient showing hydronephrosis with an absence of contrast in the ureter makes the likely diagnosis a pelviureteric junction obstruction.
Pelviureteric junction obstruction is the commonest type of urinary obstruction in childhood, but can also be seen in young adults. It is usually caused by intrinsic stenosis. It manifests as
abdominal flank or back pain, and hematuria. In newborns, a renal mass is palpable.
Antenatal sonography is the least invasive technique to diagnose PUJ obstruction in utero and reveals fetal hydronephrosis. intravenous urography is useful if the kidney is functioning.
Extrarenal pelvis dilatation, clubbing of the minor calyces, and slow diffusion of contrast down the blockage can be seen. A renal isotope scan using intravenous DTPA or MAG-3 is the best     modality to confirm the obstructive dilatation of the collecting system.
The treatment is surgical if there are bouts of renal pain, increasing hydronephrosis, evidence of parenchymal damage, and infection.
other options:
option B: Putty kidney is an end-stage manifestation of renal tuberculosis where there is
amorphous dystrophic calcification involving the entire kidney. It is shown in the image below.





option C: staghorn calculus is seen following urinary infections with Proteus, Pseudomonas, and staphylococcus. These organisms can break down urea to produce ammonia and carbon dioxide. The urine becomes alkaline and forms struvite calculi which grow into staghorn calculi. A
staghorn calculus in the left kidney is shown in the image below.


option D: Cystic kidney is seen in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) due to mutation in genes PKD1 and PKD2. It is associated with hypertension. Multiple renal bilateral
cysts will be seen, along with cysts in other organs as well such as the liver, pancreas, etc.",4999-3126.PNG,A,5021-3148.PNG;5021-2148-1.png;5021-2148-1.png
Q11,A young male patient with a history of a motor vehicle accident is unable to pass urine. Blood is seen at the meatus. what is the most likely site of urethral injury?,"a)Bulbar urethra
b)spongy urethra
c)Membranous urethra
d)penile urethra","In the given scenario of a young patient with urinary retention, blood at the meatus, and a history of a motor vehicle accident, the most likely site of injury is the membranous urethra. The given



retrograde urethrogram shows contrast leakage at the membranous urethra.
urethral injuries in men usually occur after catheterization or during cystoscopy. Injuries
following external trauma are rare, but mainly affect the bulbar or the membranous urethra.
Membranous urethral rupture usually occurs following a road traffic accident, crush injury, or a fall. It is associated with pelvic fracture and extraperitoneal bladder rupture. Clinical features
include urinary retention, blood at the meatus, and a high riding prostate on digital examination. Bruising is seen over the pubic area, scrotum, and penis.
Management is by inserting a suprapubic catheter. If there is an associated bladder rupture, the bladder will not be seen on the ultrasound, and management in such a case is by exploration,
repair, and placement of a suprapubic catheter.
other options:
option A: Bulbar urethral injury occurs following a blow to the perineum with a fall astride injury during cycling or gymnasium accidents. A typical feature is a butterfly-shaped hematoma in the
perineum. other features such as urinary retention and meatal bleeding can also be
present. Analgesia, antibiotics, and suprapubic catheterization are needed. The patient should be   discouraged from passing urine. Definitive management is delayed urethroplasty after 8-12 weeks.
options B and D: spongy and penile urethral rupture can occur following a penile fracture during coitus. Hematuria and difficulty in voiding can be present in spongy urethral injury. A pop sound  followed by severe penile pain and penile deformity is characteristic of penile urethral injury.
Hematoma, blood at the meatus, and voiding difficulties are also seen.
Retrograde urethrogram shows loss of smooth contour of the urethra with extravasation of the dye in case of a spongy urethral rupture. surgical repair is needed in both.",5000-3128.PNG,C,
Q12,"A male patient presented with a midline neck swelling. He later developed cervical node enlargement. The histopathology of the lesion is shown below. which of the following
statements is false about this condition?","a)Excellent prognosis is associated with this condition
b)It spreads quickly via lymphatics
c)Nuclear characteristics are used for identification
d)Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is not diagnostic","The given scenario of a male patient with a midline swelling, cervical lymph node enlargement,  and the histopathology showing branched papillae with orphan Annie eye nuclei is suggestive of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The false statement regarding the condition is that FNAC is not
diagnostic.
papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common thyroid malignancy. It is more commonly seen in women between the ages of 3o and 5o. Radiation exposure and family history of thyroid
malignancies are the common etiologies. Genetic abnormalities in either the RET gene or the BRAF gene can be seen in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Clinical features include an asymptomatic thyroid swelling with cervical lymph node enlargement. In advanced disease, there may be features like hoarseness, dysphagia, cough, or dyspnea.
An ultrasound scan accurately assesses the size and number of nodules, as well as categorizes the lesions as benign, indeterminate, or malignant. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a
diagnostic test, helpful in investigating an indeterminate or malignant lesion.
Histopathology shows the following features:
• Branching papillae
• orphan Annie eye nuclei: optically clear nuclei with fine nuclear chromatin



• Pseudo inclusions: invaginations ofthe nuclear membrane
• Psammoma bodies: concentric calcifications in the core of the papillae.
Papillary thyroid carcinoma is known to spread via lymphatics, hence lymph node metastasis is commonly seen.
Management is by thyroidectomy with neck dissection (central or local depending upon the site involved) followed by lifelong levothyroxine supplementation. Radioactive iodine is also useful.  The disease has an excellent prognosis, with a high survival rate.",5001-3130.PNG,D,
Q13,A 4o-year-old man who is a known case of hypertension presented with multiple episodes of hematuria and loin pain. His elder brother passed away due to stroke at the age of 4o. The    ultrasound abdomen is shown below. what is the probable diagnosis?,"a)Renal cell carcinoma
b)Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
c)Tuberculosis of the kidney
d)Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease","This clinical scenario with a family history of stroke and USG showing a cystic appearance of the kidney is suggestive of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).
ADPKD is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with mutations in the PKD1(chromosome 16) and PKD2 genes (chromosome 4).
The disease does not usually manifest before 3o years of age, and in some patients, it is never diagnosed. The progression of the disease is faster in males.
Hypertension is the most common presentation. Renal manifestations of ADPKD include:
• Flank/loin pain -  either due to hemorrhage inside cysts or due to renal stones (most commonly uric acid stones)
• Irregular upper quadrant renal mass
• Hematuria
• Uremia
• Renal failure (seen in 1o–15% of the patients who receive hemodialysis)
The most common extrarenal manifestation is hepatic cysts, which are derived from the biliary epithelium. other extra-renal manifestations of ADPKD:
• Pancreatic cysts
• Berry aneurysms (Rupture of cerebral aneurysms is an important cause of morbidity and The prevalence of intracranial aneurysms in patients with PKD is 4o%.)
• colonic diverticula
• Abdominal hernias
• Mitral valve prolapse
Screening cerebral angiography is strongly considered in all patients with PKD and a family history of cerebral aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Intravenous pyelography shows characteristic spider leg sign, as a result of stretched calyces due to multiple cysts. The nephrogram shows a swiss cheese appearance. on prenatal USG, the
presence of either &gt; 3 cysts in unilateral kidneys or &gt; 2 cysts in each kidney is suggestive of PKD.



Treatment includes
• surgical decompression is not a routine procedure performed in these patients. It may be required only in cases of very large cysts causing persistent pain and infected cysts.
• Analgesics
• Increased fluid intake
• prevents renal stone formation
• Reduces growth of cysts by suppressing ADH release
• ACE inhibitors and ARBs
• Blood pressure control
• slowing of cyst growth
• Tolvaptan (v2 receptor antagonist)
• Reduce pain and slow the decline in renal function
• Long-term dialysis
• Renal transplant
• Definitive management
• pre-transplant nephrectomy may be required in patients with very large polycystic kidneys
Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARpKD) occurs secondary to a mutation of
the pKHD1 gene. The severe form manifests in-utero or during infancy; milder cases can manifest
later in childhood. 5o% of affected newborns die in the first few days of life.
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a relatively rare complication of ADpKD. There does not seem to be an increased frequency of RCC in these patients compared to the general population. However,
when it occurs, it tends to be bilateral, multicentric, and of sarcomatoid type.

calcification.",5001-3129.PNG,B,
Q14,"A patient presents with acute-onset, severe abdominal pain. He is hemodynamically stable. A chest x-ray is shown below. what is the next step in management?","a)Gastric lavage
b)Emergency laparotomy
c)ultrasound
d)chest tube insertion","The given clinical scenario and the chest radiograph showing air under the diaphragm are
suggestive of a hollow viscus perforation. The next best step in management among the given options is emergency laparotomy.
perforation of a viscus is a life-threatening condition that occurs following the rupture of the
alimentary tract. This leads to the leakage of the enteric contents, thereby leading to acute
bacterial peritonitis. peritonitis is the generalized or localized inflammation of the peritoneum     either due to the free spillage of fluids into the peritoneal cavity or secondary bacterial infection.
Clinical features of hollow viscous perforation occur due to the developed peritonitis and the features include abdominal pain and distension, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia,
tenderness, rebound tenderness, decreased or absent bowel sounds, and guarding on palpation. Fever may be present. sometimes, features of septic shock can be seen at later stages.



Investigations include estimating the white blood cell count, urea, serum electrolytes, and an erect abdominal radiograph showing free gas under the diaphragm. A supine radiograph may show
dilated gas-filled loops of the bowel, suggestive of paralytic ileus. The below image shows a hollow viscus perforation.


Management of a hollow viscous perforation is mainly resuscitation, analgesics, intravenous
broad-spectrum antibiotics, and emergency laparotomy. peritonitis is managed by nutritional
support, pain relief, correction of fluid loss and circulating volume, urinary catheterization with or without gastrointestinal compression, antibiotics, analgesics, and specific surgical treatment of
the cause.",5002-3131.PNG,B,5025-3149.PNG
Q15,calculate the percentage of burns in a preschool child shown in the image below.,"a)15-2o%
b)25-3o%
c)35-4o%
d)1o-15%","From the given image, the percentage of burns in the child is 25-3o% calculated based on Lund and Browder chart.
In the given image, the right arm, chest, abdomen, and both thighs are involved in burns.
According to Lund and Browder chart, 2% is for the right arm, 13% for chest and abdomen
involvement, and 4% for each thigh. Hence, the total involvement is 2+13+4+4 = 23%. The closest value to 23% among the given options is 25-3o% (option B).
Lund and Browder chart is an accurate method to measure burns if it is used correctly. In this,
different proportions of body surface areas in children are taken into consideration. This chart
compensates for the changes in the shape of the body with age and can accurately assess the burns area in children.
The below image shows the Lund and Browder chart.





Note: wallace's rule of nines is used in estimating medium to large burns in adults. It helps in the quick estimation of the burns. In this, the total burn is calculated by dividing the body into areas   of 9%. It is not accurate in children.",5003-3133.PNG,B,5026-3150.PNG
Q16,A 32-year-old patient who is a chronic alcoholic presents with oral ulcers and a burning sensation. A picture of the oral cavity is given below. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Leukoplakia
b)Erythroplakia
c)submucosal fibrosis
d)Malakoplakia","The most likely diagnosis in the given scenario of a 32-year-old chronic alcoholic with oral ulcers and a burning sensation and the image showing white lesions on the oral cavity is leukoplakia.
Leukoplakia is a premalignant condition of the oral cavity characterized by whitish patches or plaques that cannot be rubbed off.
They appear as small, well-circumscribed lesions and can extensively involve a large area of the oral mucosa.
variants of leukoplakia are
• speckled leukoplakia is whitish lesions on an erythematous base. They have the highest risk of malignant transformation.
• proliferative verrucous leukoplakia is rare and has a high risk for malignant transformation.
Management includes smoking cessation and reduction in alcohol consumption. A biopsy should be done and a photographic record of the lesion is used for follow-up.
other premalignant conditions of the oral cavity are erythroplakia and oral submucosal fibrosis.
Erthroplakia (option B) refers to irregular, reddish velvety plaques on the oral cavity. The surface may be nodular and may bleed. It has a high risk of malignant transformation. Biopsy should be  done followed by surgical ablation.
oral submucosal fibrosis (option C) is characterized by the formation of fibrous bands beneath the oral cavity. The disease is progressive and causes limitation of mouth opening and restricted
tongue movements. Intralesional steroids and surgical excision of fibrous bands are
recommended.



Malakoplakia (option D) is a rare inflammatory condition affecting immunocompromised
individuals. It mainly affects the urinary tract but can involve any organ system. The clinical
presentation includes tender ulcerations, nodules, papules, and plaques or fungating masses with perianal and genital skin involvement. systemic antibiotics and surgical excision are
recommended.",5003-3132.PNG,A,
Q17,A patient presents with a tender pulsatile mass as shown in the image below. what will be done next for this patient?,"a)ultrasound doppler
b)Needle aspiration
c)CT angiogram with percutaneous management
d)Intravenous antibiotics for 7 days","The given scenario of a patient with tender pulsatile mass, and the image showing an
erythematous swelling at the base of the neck on the left side, is likely to be a vascular
anomaly. ultrasound Doppler should be done next in this patient.
The diagnosis of vascular anomalies is done clinically and with imaging like ultrasound Doppler.   MRI plays an important role in diagnosing the type and extent of the lesion. cT angiogram can be used to find out the feeding vessel (option c).
vascular anomalies include malformations and tumors. vascular malformations occur as a result of developmental abnormality of an artery, vein, capillary or lymphatic system. They can be
pulsatile or have a thrill when the underlying component is an artery.
Hemangiomas are the most common vascular tumors. They are seen in infants and present as
bright red lesions. common sites of a hemangioma include the head and neck. It can be of two    types capillary and cavernous hemangioma. compressibility and bluish surface are some clinical features of hemangiomas.
These lesions can be treated by complete resection. Debulking is done when complete resection is not possible. sclerotherapy is mainly useful in venous malformation. Embolization can be done
after surgical resection of the lesion.
Note: cirsoid aneurysm is a slow-growing, tortuous swelling over the scalp or face that develops due to abnormal arteriovenous connections in the scalp and extremities. They are usually
congenital. However, in some cases, they may be traumatic. The superficial temporal artery is commonly involved in cirsoid aneurysms ofthe scalp.",5004-3134.PNG,A,
Q18,"A patient presents with carcinoma of the prostate, which has now spread to the vertebra. what is the route of spread to the lumbar vertebra?","a)prostatic venous plexus
b)Transcoelomic spread
c)Inferior vesical vein
d)Internal iliac vein","The route of the spread of prostate carcinoma to the lumbar vertebra is by prostatic venous plexus or Batson plexus.
Batson venous plexus is a valveless vertebral venous plexus communicating with prostatic venous plexus.
carcinoma of the prostate metastasizes to the bone usually by the bloodstream through this
Batson plexus. Long bones and the lower lumbar vertebrae are usually involved. other routes of spread of prostate carcinoma are local spread to the seminal vesicles, bladder neck, trigone, and lymphatic spread.
carcinoma of the prostate is the most common malignancy in men above 65 years. The clinical features of prostate cancer are bladder outlet obstruction, pelvic pain, hematuria, arthritis,



anemia, pancytopenia, and renal failure. Per rectal examination reveals a hard, nodular,
irregularly indurated gland.
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is useful in assessing the follow-up. PSA &gt;1o ng/mL is
suggestive of cancer and levels &gt;35 ng/mL are diagnostic of advanced prostate cancer. The prostatic biopsy is indicated when there is a raised PSA level or suspicion of prostate cancer.
Localized cancer is treated by radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy, while in advanced cancer palliative and hormone ablation should be carried out.",,A,
Q19,A male patient presents with impotence and bilateral resting pain. The following finding is seen in the legs. At which level has the pathology occurred?,"a)Bilateral popliteal arteries
b)Bilateral internal iliac arteries
c)Aortoiliac bifurcation
d)Bilateral femoral arteries","The given scenario of a male patient with impotence, bilateral resting pain, and the image showing a gangrenous foot with amputated toes is suggestive of Leriche's syndrome and it indicates that the level of occlusion is at the aortoiliac bifurcation.
Peripheral arterial diseases occur mainly due to atherosclerosis or thromboembolism. Lerich's   syndrome is a rare condition in which aortoiliac obstruction causes impotence and claudication (crampy pain) in the thigh or buttocks. other features of aortoiliac arterial occlusion include
absent femoral and distal pulses and a bruit over the aortoiliac region.
In general, features of chronic lower limb arterial occlusion are intermittent claudication, rest
pain, ulcers, gangrene, absence of arterial pulses, bruit, and delayed capillary refilling. Rest pain   occurs when limb perfusion is so severely compromised that anaerobic respiration occurs even at rest. This causes pain that increases on lying down or elevation of the foot. It reduces when the     foot hangs below.
Investigations that are useful include Doppler ultrasound, duplex scanning, ankle-brachial
pressure index, and digital subtraction percutaneous angiography (DSA). Through a DSA,
endovascular intervention can be performed along with obtaining information on the dynamic arterial flow.
Management is by exercise, smoking cessation, control of diabetes, and weight loss if obese. Drugs such as HMG CoA reductase inhibitors and 75 mg of clopidogrel or aspirin should be given.
Transluminal angioplasty and stenting are useful.
other options:
options A and D: Femoropopliteal occlusion can lead to claudication in the calf with a palpable femoral pulse but absent distal pulses.
option B: Iliac obstruction causes thigh and calf claudication with a bruit over the aortoiliac region. The femoral and distal pulses are absent.",5005-3135.PNG,C,
Q20,"An elderly male patient presented with a sudden onset of scrotal pain and discharge. Based on the image below, what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Torsion of testis
b)Acute epididymo-orchitis
c)scrotal carcinoma
d)Fournierls gangrene","The given scenario of an elderly male patient with sudden-onset scrotal pain and discharge, with the image showing a blackish discoloration of the scrotum, is likely to be Fournier's gangrene.



Fournier's gangrene is an uncommon polymicrobial infection involving the perineal soft tissue,
external genitalia, and perianal region. There is subcutaneous tissue inflammation leading to
obliterative arteritis and gangrene. It typically follows minor injuries or procedures in the perineal area, urethral dilatation, and injection for hemorrhoids are some of the etiological factors.
clinically, sudden scrotal pain with associated prostration, pallor, and pyrexia can be seen. other features such as crepitus and foul-smelling exudate can be present.
Emergency surgical debridement is needed after initial measures like fluid resuscitation and
broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics are undertaken. urinary diversion and other supportive measures are useful in the management of the condition.
other options:
option A: Torsion of testis is a surgical emergency typically seen in the age group of 1o-25 years.    It is characterized by sudden groin and lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Examination findings reveal a swollen, tender scrotum and testis with a twisted tender cord above it and loss of cremasteric reflex.
option B: Acute epididymo-orchitis is an infection of the epididymis and testis. It is seen in
sexually-active young men. In older men, it is seen following a urinary tract infection, secondary to an indwelling catheter. The features include groin ache, fever, swollen and painful epididymis and testis.
option c: scrotal carcinoma is a rare carcinoma that is seen in workers exposed to oil, coal
products, and aromatic hydrocarbons. It starts as a wart or ulcer in the scrotum and can extend to the testis.",5006-3137.PNG,D,
Q21,Identify the fluid shown below.,"a)Haemaccel
b)Ringer lactate
c)Isolyte P
d)Isolyte M","The fluid shown in the image is ringer lactate or Hartmann's solution.
Ringer lactate, or Hartmann's solution, is a crystalloid made up of sodium 131 mEq, chloride 112 mEq, potassium 5 mEq, bicarbonate (as lactate) 29 mEq, and 2 mEq of calcium. It is devoid of    glucose.
It is useful in the following conditions:
• correction of severe hypovolemia
• Metabolic acidosis
• postoperative period, burns, diarrhea
• correction of hypokalemia
• Diabetic ketoacidosis.
It should be avoided in severe shock, liver diseases, vomiting, nasogastric aspiration, and
metabolic alkalosis. It cannot be used along with blood transfusion since calcium in the ringer lactate can bind with citrate in the transfused blood leading to clot formation.
other options:



option A: Haemaccel is a colloid and contains 145 mmol of sodium, 6.25 mmol of calcium, and 5.1 mmol of potassium. It is mainly used for rapid volume replacement in circulatory shock, burns,
and trauma. These release histamine and hence, H2 blocker has to be supplemented. It is also used in heart-lung machines.
options C and D: Isolyte p and Isolyte M are crystalloids. Isolyte p is commonly used in fluid therapy for pediatrics. one liter contains 5o grams of glucose, 25 mEq of sodium, 22 mEq of  potassium, 3 mEq of magnesium, and 23 mEq of acetate. Hyponatremia, renal failure,
hyperkalemia, and hypovolemic shock are some of the contraindications.
Isolyte M is used for maintenance. It mainly contains 5o grams of glucose, 4o mEq sodium, 38
mEq chloride, 35 mEq potassium, 15 mEq phosphate, and 2o mEq acetate. It is useful in
correcting hypokalemia in patients with good renal function, and acidosis. It is contraindicated in hyponatremia.",5006-3136.PNG,B,
Q22,The image below shows a pressure sore. which stage does this belong to ?,"a)stage 1
b)stage 2
c)stage 3
d)stage 4","The given image shows a pressure sore with extensive tissue destruction, including damage to the muscle layer and thus it belongs to stage 4.
pressure sores also referred known as bed sores, pressure ulcers and decubitus ulcers are ulcers that occur due to prolonged pressure on certain sites thereby leading to tissue necrosis. The
commonest sites involved are ischium, greater trochanter, sacrum, heel, malleolus (lateral
&gt;medial), and occiput. paraplegic patients, elderly patients, and severely ill patients are at a higher risk of developing pressure sores.
They are staged as:
• stage 1 - Erythema with no blanching and no breach in the epidermis.
• stage 2- partial-thickness skin loss with epidermal and dermal involvement.
• stage 3- Full-thickness skin loss with intact fascia but the involvement of the subcutaneous tissue.
• stage 4- Full-thickness skin loss extending to the fascia with massive tissue destruction and involvement of muscle, bone, tendon, or joint.
Management is primarily proper skin care with pressure dispersion cushions, air-fluidized beds,   and urinary or fecal diversion if required. patients who are bed-bound should be turned once in 2 hours. Those in a wheelchair should lift themselves off the seat for 1o seconds every 1o minutes.
surgery is the last resort and is done after a proper initial debridement and vacuum-assisted closure. vacuum-assisted closure is a wound closure technique in which negative pressure is applied to the wound which leads to a decrease in edema. This hastens the debridement and formation of granulation tissue. skin flaps with a muscle are also used for closure.",5007-3138.PNG,D,
Q23,Identify the most common site of an intra-abdominal abscess.,"a)1
b)2
c)3
d)4","Among the marked parts, 4 represents the right subhepatic space. It is the most common site of an intra-abdominal abscess.
The right subhepatic space is a deep space situated in Rutherford Morison's pouch. It is
located between the liver above and the transverse colon and the hepatic flexure below. The relations of the right subhepatic space are:
• the right lobe of the liver and diaphragm on the right side
• foramen of winslow on the left
• duodenum below
• liver and the gall bladder in the front
• right kidney and the diaphragm behind.
Abscesses here usually arise from appendicitis, cholecystitis, perforated duodenal ulcer, or as sequelae of an upper abdominal surgery.
Intraperitoneal abscesses may develop following intraperitoneal sepsis in specific sites in the
abdomen (intra-abdominal abscess) or pelvis (pelvic abscess). The intra-abdominal abscess may occur in subphrenic spaces, or the subhepatic spaces, on either the right or left side.


An intra-abdominal abscess is a localized collection of infected fluid within the abdominal cavity due to failure of the host's intra-abdominal defense mechanisms. patients usually present with
acute abdominal pain, fever, rigors, tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis. other features such as nausea, anorexia, emesis, constipation, and diarrhea can occur.
CT scan with IV contrast is the imaging method of choice for an intra-abdominal abscess.
ultrasonography can also be useful.
Initial management is by early intravenous antibiotic therapy, drainage of the abscess, and fluid    resuscitation with crystalloids. Vasopressors, inotropes, and packed red blood cell transfusion are given when needed.
other measures include ultrasound or CT-guided percutaneous drainage (non-surgical) and operative drainage. Resection and debridement can also be done. It can be done through a



minimally invasive technique or laparotomy.",5008-3140.PNG,D,5031-3151.PNG
Q24,A man came with complaints of recurrent discharge and pain due to lesions around the anus for 3 years. what is the diagnosis?,"a)pilonidal sinus
b)carbuncle
c)Boil
d)Fistula in ano","The given clinical scenario of recurrent pain and discharge due to lesions around the anus, shown in the image is likely to be a fistula-in-ano.
A fistula-in-ano is an abnormal connection between the anal canal and the perianal skin, lined with granulation tissue. It may follow the drainage of a perianal abscess or may be seen in
association with diseases like tuberculosis or crohn's disease.
clinical features are perianal pain, swelling, and intermittent purulent discharge, which might be blood-stained. on examination, one or more external openings may be visible.
Goodsall’s rule can be used as a guide in determining the location of the internal opening of the fistula. Fistulas with an external opening anteriorly connect to the internal opening by a short,   radial tract. Fistulas with an external opening posteriorly track in a curvilinear fashion to the
posterior midline.
However, exceptions to this rule often occur. Fistulas with an anterior external opening greater than 3 cm from the anal margin usually track to the posterior midline.


The investigations done for fistula-in-ano can include a fistulogram, endoanal ultrasound with hydrogen peroxide, MRI, and computed tomography (cT) scan. An MRI is the gold standard    investigation for fistula imaging. It helps us to identify the secondary extensions of the track,   which when missed may cause persistence of the fistula.
surgical management includes fistulotomy, fistulectomy, ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT), setons, or advancement flaps.",5008-3139.PNG,D,5032-3152.PNG
Q25,"According to triage, which of the following categories of patients comes under green?","a)Ambulatory patients
b)Medium risk patients
c)High risk patients
d)Dead patients","Ambulatory patients that are stable are likely to survive even if treatment is delayed. Their medical need is not urgent and they come under green according to triage.
Triage is a method employed to identify the patients in whom treatment at the earliest produces the maximum benefit to the patient. It is used in the management of mass casualties.
Triage categories are based on the vital signs, patient's ability to walk, mental status, and presence or absence of ventilation/capillary perfusion. It is as follows:
