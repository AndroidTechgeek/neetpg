Q1,"A patient underwent a hysterectomy and was given morphine in the post-operative period
and in the ward for pain. she now presents with respiratory depression and pin point pupils. what is the drug used to treat this condition?","a)Naloxone
b)pethidine
c)Atropine
d)Buprenorphine","The drug of choice for the reversal of respiratory depression is naloxone. Naloxone is a
competitive antagonist at μ-opioid receptors and rapidly reverses the effects of opioid toxicity when administered.
opioid overdose symptoms:
• Triad of coma, respiratory depression, and pinpoint pupils (miosis).
• Hypotension, bradycardia
• shallow breathing
• Hypothermia
Naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist which reverses all effects, except sedation. Naloxone is also used for reversing neonatal asphyxia due to opioid usage in labor.
other options
option B - Meperidine (pethidine) is a mu-opioid receptor (MoR) agonist. It has a strong
analgesic effect on the central nervous system. It is mainly used as an analgesic but can also be

used in post-anesthetic shivering. It has a greater ability to enter the CNS and produce analgesia at lower systemic concentrations compared to morphine. Therefore, constipation, urinary
retention, and nausea are less frequent compared to morphine.
Meperidine can cross the placenta and cause significant respiratory depression in the fetus. In
patients or addicts who are tolerant to the depressant effects of meperidine, large doses repeated at short intervals may produce an excitatory syndrome that includes hallucinations, tremors,
muscle twitches, etc.
option C -Atropine is an anticholinergic drug. It acts through reversible, competitive inhibition of the postsynaptic muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. It is indicated in the treatment of
organophosphate/muscarinic poisoning, in bradycardia, and to reduce salivary secretions.
The adverse effects of atropine are due to the antimuscarinic effects, including xerostomia,
blurring of vision, photophobia, tachycardia, flushing, warm, dry skin, constipation, urinary
retention, anhidrosis, delirium, and coma. Intoxication with atropine results in all the above
symptoms along with convulsions, and circulatory collapse due to respiratory failure. Death may occur secondary to respiratory paralysis.
option D - Buprenorphine is a partial μ agonist and an antagonist at δ and κ receptors. It is used as an analgesic and in the management of opioid dependence.",,A,
Q2,Drug used for trastuzumab-resistant her 2 positive breast cancer is:,"a)vismodegib
b)Lapatinib
c)vemurafenib
d)Erlotinib","Lapatinib is used for trastuzumab-resistant HER-2 neu-positive breast carcinoma.
Lapatinib is an orally bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor of the EGFR and HER2 tyrosine kinases. Lapatinib is metabolized by Cyp3A4.
Lapatinib in combination with capecitabine is approved for the treatment of patients with
metastatic HER2-positive trastuzumab-refractory breast cancer. Lapatinib is also used in
combination with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole to treat postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.
Frequent adverse effects include acneiform rash, diarrhea, cramping, and exacerbation of
gastroesophageal reflux. Cardiac toxicity appears less pronounced than with trastuzumab,
although lapatinib should be used with caution in combination with cardiotoxic drugs. A
dose-dependent prolongation of the QT interval has been reported; thus, careful monitoring of patients with heart disease is recommended. Hepatotoxicity that may be severe has been
observed.
Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the HER2 receptor. It is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.
other options:
option A: vismodegib is a hedgehog pathway inhibitor used to treat metastatic and locally advanced BCCs.
option C: vemurafenib is a BRAF inhibitors used in metastatic melanoma and thyroid cancers with BRAF v6OOE mutation.

option D: Erlotinib is a protein kinase antagonists which is the first line treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma with EGFR deletion of exon 19 or L858R mutation",,B,
Q3,Nomogram used for vancomycin dosing is?,"a)salazar
b)Halsted
c)Rummack-mathew
d)Matzke","The nomogram used for vancomycin dosing is the Matzke nomogram.
The Matzke nomogram includes dosing intervals ranging from o.5 to 12 days on a continuum of     CLcr(Creatinine clearance) values from o to 12o mL/min. It is designed to guide the determination of the initial empiric dose and interval of intravenous (IV) vancomycin in hospitalized adults who   are not receiving hemodialysis. The nomogram does not apply to patients who exhibit highly
variable vancomycin pharmacokinetics. These patients include the critically ill, those with burn
injuries affecting more than 2o percent of their body surface, patients with rapidly changing renal function, pregnant women, those with liver failure/ascites, individuals at the extremes of weight,   patients who are acutely post-transplant, and those with cystic fibrosis
The Rumack-Matthew nomogram uses the serum acetaminophen concentration, in relation to the time after ingestion, to assess potential hepatotoxicity after a single, acute ingestion of
acetaminophen.",,D,
Q4,which of the following is true statement regarding lithium?,"a)It is not absorbed from the stomach
b)It can cause fine tremors in the therapeutic range
c)Approved for the treatment of absent seizures
d)It is not teratogenic","The true statement about lithium is it can cause fine tremors in the therapeutic range.
Lithium has a very narrow therapeutic index of o.8-1.2 mEq/L. The severity of lithium toxicity is often divided into the following three grades:
A fine tremor is common in patients taking lithium at therapeutic doses. Therapeutic lithium
tremor is generally symmetric, limited to the arms, and nonprogressive. The tremor from lithium   toxicity is coarser and more disabling, may also affect the legs, and occurs with other symptoms of toxicity. other adverse effects include mental confusion, hypothyroidism, nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus, and edema. Lithium use in early pregnancy causes Ebstein anomaly in the fetus(option D). Fetal lithium exposure is associated with neonatal goiter, CNS depression, hypotonia (floppy    baby syndrome), and cardiac murmur.
As lithium is readily dialyzed, lithium overdose or toxicity is treated with hemodialysis.
Lithium is a mood stabilizer with a very narrow therapeutic index. Lithium is administered orally. Lithium is almost completely absorbed from the GI tract(option A). It is the first line of
management in bipolar disorder.
Lithium is also used in the management of mania and has anti-suicidal properties. (option C) It     has a narrow therapeutic index, and blood levels in excess of this may cause symptoms of toxicity. Therapeutic drug monitoring is done by measuring lithium levels 12 hours after the last dose.

Grade	sr. lithium concentration(in mEq/L)	symptoms
Mild symptoms	1.5-2.5	Nausea, vomiting,tremor, an d fatigue
Moderate intoxicatio n	2.5-3.5	Confusion, agitation, deliriu   m, tachycardia, and hyperton ia
severe intoxication	>3.5	Coma,seizures, hyperthermia, and hypotension",,B,
Q5,Match the following,"a)A-2, B-3, C-4, D-1
b)A-3, B-4, C-1, D-2
c)A-4, B-2, C-3, D-1
d)A-1, B-2, C-3, D-4","Mirabegron is a β3-adrenergic receptor agonist which is used for bladder incontinence. Activation of this receptor in the bladder leads to detrusor muscle relaxation and increased bladder capacity. This action prevents voiding and provides relief for those with an overactive bladder and urinary   incontinence.
Indacaterol is a very long acting beta 2 agonists (v-LABA) and can be used once daily in COPD maintenance.
Betaxolol is a β1 selective third-generation β-blocker with additional calcium entry blockade activity and a slight membrane-stabilizing property. It does not have agonist activity.
Isoproterenol is a non-selective beta agonist (β1=β2) with no α action. The direct action on
cardiac β1 receptors causes an increased risk of tachycardia and arrhythmias. The decrease in peripheral vascular resistance is due to β2 action causing a fall in diastolic blood
pressure. Isoproterenol currently may be used as a cardiac stimulant in patients with bradycardia or heart block, particularly in anticipation of inserting an artificial cardiac pacemaker.

A. Mirabegron	3. Beta 3
B. Indacaterol	4. Beta 2
C. Betaxolol	1. Beta 1
D. Isoproteren ol	2. Beta",,B,
Q6,True about therapeutic index of a drug is:,"a)Denotes safety and efficacy after experiments on humans
b)Denotes safety and efficacy in the population
c)Denotes safety and efficacy in an individual
d)Ratio of median lethal dose in 5O% of population to median effective dose in 5O% of population","The therapeutic index of a drug denotes the safety and efficacy of the drug in the population (option B), not the individual (option C).
The therapeutic index is calculated with the following equations:

LD5o/ED5o or TD5o/ED5o
where LD5o is the median lethal dose, TD5o is the mean toxic dose, and ED5o is the median effective dose
The therapeutic index (TI) describes a relationship between the doses of a drug that causes lethal or toxic effects with the dose that causes therapeutic effects. It is also called the therapeutic ratio. The therapeutic index is used to assess the safety of the drug administered.
Median lethal dose (LD5o) and median toxic dose (TD5o)
• LD5o is the dose of the drug at which 5o% of the experimental animals die
• In human trials, TD5o can be considered. It is the dose of the drug that causes adverse effects in 5o% of the population (option D)
• The larger the LD5o or TD5o, the safer the drug
Median effective dose (ED5o) is the quantity of a drug that can produce the desired therapeutic effects in 5o% of the population.
Therapeutic window refers to a range of concentrations at which the likelihood of efficacy is high and the probability of adverse effects is low.
Note: option D is incorrect as it does not make the necessary distinction that the therapeutic
index is the ratio of the median lethal dose in 5o% of animals (as the human population cannot be used for lethal studies) to the median effective dose in 5o% of the population. LD5o is measured    in animals, not in humans. option B is a better choice.",,B,
Q7,osimertinib is used in NSCLC with which of the following mutation?,"a)T79OM mutation
b)L858R mutation
c)T89OM mutation
d)M79OT mutation","The T79oM mutation in the EGFR gene is known to cause resistance to first and
second-generation EGFR inhibitors. osimertinib, as a third-generation EGFR inhibitor, is
effective against this resistance, hence it is often used for patients with the T79oM mutation after they've progressed on first or second-generation EGFR inhibitors.
The question seems to be asking specifically for the mutation that osimertinib is particularly known for being used against, and that would be the T79oM mutation.
osimertinib is a kinase inhibitor that is approved for
• patients with metastatic non small cell lung carcinoma(NSCLC) that has progressed after prior EGFR TKI treatment and is positive for the EGFR T79oM mutation.
• First-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC and adjuvant therapy after resection of NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations
So, osimertinib is used both for the L858R mutation and T79oM mutation in different settings. But T79oM mutation is often highlighted because of its association with resistance to first and   second-generation EGFR inhibitors, and because osimertinib can overcome this resistance.
osimertinib is administered orally and is a substrate of Cyp3A. The drug is primarily eliminated in the feces and to a lesser extent in the urine. Concurrent administration of inducers of Cyp3A4 may necessitate an increase in the dose.

The adverse effects after osimertinib treatment are leukopenia, diarrhea, skin rash, interstitial lung disease, QTc prolongation, and left ventricular dysfunction.",,A,
Q8,A patient was started on a drug for mood disorder and he developed priapism. The causative drug is:,"a)Trazodone
b)venlafaxine
c)Bupropion
d)Mirtazapine","Trazodone causes priapism.
Trazodone is an atypical antidepressant drug. It is a serotonin receptor antagonist. other drugs
which belong to this include nefazodone, mirtazapine, and mianserin. Low doses oftrazodone
(5o–2oo mg) have been used widely, both alone and concurrently with SSRIs or SNRIs, to treat      insomnia. Trazodone use is associated with priapism in rare instances. Intracavernous injection of phenylephrine can be used to treat priapism.
other options:
option B: venlafaxine is a second-line drug used in generalized anxiety disorder. It belongs to the class of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). venlafaxine can induce sustained   diastolic hypertension (diastolic blood pressure &gt;9o mmHg at consecutive weekly visits).
venlafaxine also is associated with an increased risk of perinatal complications.
option c: Bupropion is a first-line drug used for nicotine cessation and has the added benefit of causing weight loss. weight gain is commonly seen after stopping nicotine use. Hence this drug  can be used in this patient as it treats both of these.
option D: Mirtazapine is used in major depressive disorder. It increases appetite and causes significant weight gain.",,A,
Q9,cyclosporine-induced cholestasis is due to which receptor?,"a)MDR 1
b)BRcA
c)MRP 1
d)OAT1B1","cyclosporine induced cholestasis is due to MDR1 transporter.
ABc transporters such as MRP2, MDR1, BcRP, BSEP, and MDR3 in the bile canalicular
membrane of hepatocytes mediate the efflux (excretion) of drugs and their metabolites, bile salts, and phospholipids against a steep concentration gradient from liver to bile. This primary active    transport is driven by ATP hydrolysis.
cyclosporine, an MDR1 substrate can cause cholestatic liver injury through the following mechanisms:
• competitive inhibition of ATP dependent transporters.
• Inhibition of intrahepatic vesicle transport and targeting of ATP dependent transporters to the canalicular membrane.
• Impairment of bile secretion partly by increasing canalicular membrane fluidity without affecting the expression of canalicular transporters.
cyclosporine is an immunomodulatory drug that inhibits calcineurin activity by forming a
complex with cyclophilin, a cytoplasmic-receptor protein present in target cells, to form a
cyclosporine-cyclophilin complex.calcineurin is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase required for the induction of T cell lymphokine production and proliferation.

This drug-receptor complex specifically and competitively binds to and inhibits calcineurin, a
calcium and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase. This, in turn, inhibits the translocation of a
family of transcription factors (NF-AT), leading to reduced transcriptional activation of cytokine genes for interleukin (IL)-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-3, IL-4, cD4oL,
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interferon-gamma. ultimately, the proliferation of T lymphocytes is reduced, resulting in immunomodulation.
Its uses are as follows:
• In solid organ transplantation, to prevent organ rejection in kidney, liver, and heart allogeneic transplants
• In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, when the disease has not adequately responded to methotrexate
• cyclosporine reportedly is effective in Behc■et’s disease, acute ocular syndrome, endogenous uveitis, atopic dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and nephrotic syndrome.
Adverse effects of cyclosporine include a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and
metabolic disturbances like hypomagnesemia, hyperkalemia, dyslipidemia, gynecomastia,
hypertrichosis; neurotoxicity in the form of convulsions. There is an increased risk of developing skin and lymphoproliferative malignancies in cyclosporine-treated psoriasis patients.",,A,
Q10,"A diabetic patient was started on a drug that decreased her HbA1c from 7.6 to 6.7. she
started complaining of itching around vulvovaginal area . what was the most likely drug she was started on?","a)Acarbose
b)canagliflozin
c)Linagliptin
d)Liraglutide","In the above clinical scenario, the most likely cause of itching around the vulvovaginal area
is canagliflozin. The side effects associated with canagliflozin are urinary tract infections, genital mycotic infections due to the high glucose content of the urine, increased risk of fractures, and    lower extremity amputations.
canagliflozin is a sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor. other SGLT-2 inhibitors
include dapagliflozin and empagliflozin. They act by inhibiting the SGLT-2 transporter which is
present on the proximal segment of the renal tubule. It is responsible for the reabsorption of
8o-9o% of filtered glucose. It inhibits glucose reabsorption resulting in glycosuria and a change in the renal threshold.
SGLT2 inhibitors can cause mild weight loss and reduction in blood pressure. Drugs
like empagliflozin and canagliflozin are found to reduce major cardiovascular events.
The common side effects include urinary tract infections and genital mycotic infections due to the high glucose content of the urine. There is a risk of the development of diabetic ketoacidosis. It
increases the risk of fractures and lower limb amputations due to the creation of an imbalance
with the minerals and circulating parathormone and vitamin D. Since SGLT2 inhibitors depend
on the rate of glucose filtration to be effective, potency decreases if given in stage 3 kidney disease (GFR 6o–3o mL/min).
other options:
option A: Acarbose is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. It reduces the intestinal absorption of    glucose by inhibiting the intestinal brush border enzyme, alpha-glucosidase. These drugs also increase GLP-1 levels in circulation. They reduce post-prandial glucose levels.

option C: Linagliptin is a dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. It is used in type 2 diabetes as monotherapy or in combination therapy when metformin is not tolerated or contraindicated.
It binds extensively to plasma proteins and is cleared primarily by the hepatobiliary
system. Hence, no dosage adjustment is needed in renal failure. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4
inhibitors enhance the release of insulin postprandially, decrease glucagon, and thereby lower mealtime as well as fasting glucose. They are weight neutral.
option D: Liraglutide is also a GLP-1 receptor agonist and is given only in the subcutaneous injectable form. It was recently approved in the treatment of obesity.",,B,
Q11,"An anti-diabetic drug causes a decrease in HbA1c by causing an increase in GIP and GLP-1
levels and a decrease in glucagon levels. It is an oral drug causing a reduction in both pre and post-prandial glucose. The drug is:","a)Pramlinitide
b)Alogliptin
c)Liraglutide
d)Metformin","Alogliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP) inhibitor. Glucagon-like peptide (GLP) and
glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are both incretins that promote the exocytosis of insulin into circulation. Both these incretins are rapidly inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase. So, inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase enhances the action of incretins and facilitates insulin
release. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors enhance the release of insulin postprandially, decrease glucagon, and thereby lower mealtime as well as fasting glucose.
other DPP-4 inhibitors include saxagliptin, linagliptin, alogliptin, and vildagliptin. They are weight neutral.
DPP-4 inhibitors are associated with severe joint pain which reduces on discontinuation of the drug. Linagliptin is cleared primarily by hepatobiliary system, with little renal clearance. only  saxagliptin is metabolized by the liver and must be used in lower doses if used along with a
cytochrome p45o enzyme inhibitor drug. other drugs are renally excreted and hence must be used with caution in renal insufficiency.
other options:
option A - Pramlintide is an amylin agonist. It reduces postprandial glycemia and leads to weight loss.
option C - Liraglutide is also a GLP-1 receptor agonist and is given only in the subcutaneous injectable form. It was recently approved for the treatment of obesity.
option D - Metformin belongs to the biguanides class of oral hypoglycemic agents. It acts by
activation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK). This results in reduced hepatic glucose
production. Side effects of metformin are lactic acidosis, gastrointestinal disturbance, and vitamin B12 deficiency.",,B,
Q12,what is true about keynote 189 trial?,"a)pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy used in NSCLC
b)pembrolizumab used in NSCLC
c)Nivolumab plus chemotherapy used in NSCLC
d)Nivolumab is used in NSCLC","Keynote 189 trial is a efficacy and safety study of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in metastatic non-small cell carcinoma of lung.
Keynote 189 trial is an efficacy and safety study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) combined with
pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy versus pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy alone in
participants with advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who

have not previously received systemic therapy for advanced disease. participants will be randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab combined with pemetrexed/platinum.
Methods
In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, patients were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio). 616 patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR or ALK mutations who had
received no previous treatment for metastatic disease to receive pemetrexed and a platinum-based drug plus either 2oo mg of pembrolizumab or placebo every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by
pembrolizumab or placebo for up to a total of 35 cycles plus pemetrexed maintenance therapy.
Crossover to pembrolizumab monotherapy was permitted among the patients in the
placebo-combination group who had verified disease progression. The primary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival, as assessed by a blinded, independent central
radiologic review.
Conclusions
In patients with previously untreated metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC
without EGFR or ALK mutations, the addition of pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy of pemetrexed and a platinum-based drug resulted in significantly longer overall survival and
progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone.",,A,
Q13,which of the following is not a mechanism for thalidomide teratogenicity?,"a)Release of reactive oxygen species and free radicles
b)Supression of angiogenesis
c)Cereblon binding
d)Inhibition of IL2, IL4, IL5","Thalidomide does not cause teratogenicity by inhibition of IL2, IL4, and IL5.
The mechanism of thalidomide teratogenicity include oxidative stress, anti-angiogenesis, and
thalidomide-binding protein, cereblon which has a role in the development of cerebral tissues and because its expression in the hippocampus among other areas is associated with memory and
learning processes (CRBN). Fetal thalidomide exposure causes phocomelia. This disorder is
associated with underdeveloped limbs and absent pelvic bones. Both upper and lower limbs are     affected, and a part of the limbs may be missing. Fused fingers and missing thumbs are also seen. Thalidomide was originally used for the treatment of pregnancy-associated morning sickness but   was withdrawn due to this adverse effect. It is now used for the treatment of erythema nodosum    leprosum.
Thalidomide is an immunomodulator. Thalidomide absorption from the GI tract is slow and
highly variable. It distributes throughout most tissues and organs, without significant binding to plasma proteins. Thalidomide and its metabolites are excreted in the urine, while the
nonabsorbed portion of the drug is excreted unchanged in feces.
Common adverse effects of thalidomide include sedation and constipation. However, one of the most serious adverse effects is peripheral sensory neuropathy, characterized by asymmetrical,
painful, peripheral paresthesia with sensory loss. Symptoms often present as numbness of the
toes and feet, muscle cramps, weakness, signs of pyramidal tract involvement, and carpal tunnel syndrome.",,D,
Q14,which is a rare but very severe side effect of clozapine that requires regular monitoring?,"a)Suicidal tendency
b)Agranulocytosis
c)Myocarditis
d)Cerebral bleeding","Agranulocytosis is a rare but very severe side effect of clozapine that requires regular monitoring.
A patient who is on clozapine should undergo regular hematological monitoring due to the risk of agranulocytosis. Avoid combining clozapine with other agranulocytosis-causing drugs like
carbamazepine, phenytoin, propylthiouracil, and sulfonamides.
Adverse effects of clozapine are:
• Sedation and weight gain- H1 antagonism
• Syncope, tachycardia, hypotension- α1 antagonism
• Hypersalivation/sialorrhea- M4 agonism
• Seizures- dose-dependant
• Agranulocytosis- dose-independent
clozapine reduces the seizure threshold thus increasing the risk of seizures. clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, is an antagonist of 5HT2A, D1, D3, D4, and α-receptors. clozapine is used in
treatment-resistant schizophrenia, suicidal patients with schizophrenia, severe psychotic depression, and Huntington's disease.",,B,
Q15,which of the following newly approved anti-diabetic drugs can be given for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and impaired renal function?,"a)Empaglifozin
b)Degludec
c)Linagliptin
d)Rosiglitazone","Empaglifozin, which is a sodium-glucose transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor has been recently
approved for use in patients with Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction, and can be
initiated in patients with impaired renal function with estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt; 2o mL/min/1.73 m2.
Empagliflozin works by inhibiting the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) in the proximal renal tubules resulting in reduced reabsorption and increased urinary excretion of glucose. The    glucose-lowering effect is independent of insulin. Empagliflozin acts as a diuretic and natriuretic by reducing sodium and volume load, causing intravascular contraction. Empagliflozin is also
associated with weight loss, with reductions in blood pressure without increasing heart rate.
Empagliflozin has been found to decrease the risk of mortality from cardiovascular causes in diabetic patients.
SGLT-2 inhibitors have a cardioprotective effect resulting from improved cardiac cell metabolism, improvement of ventricular loading mechanism, reduction of cardiac cell necrosis and fibrosis. It  also has a renoprotective property.
Except for empaglifozin which can be used in chronic kidney disease, use of other SGLT-2
inhibitors might lead to acute kidney injury and should be avoided in patients with renal failure. Side effects of empaglifozin includes dehydration, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, urinary tract infections, genital mycotic infections, hypoglycemia and necrotizing fasciitis.
Side effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors include dehydration, hyperkalemia, worsening of diabetic
ketoacidosis, increased risk of fractures, leg and foot amputation with canagliflozin, and a possible increased risk of bladder cancer with dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin has also been recently approved
by the FDA for treatment of Heart failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, it has been associated with increased risk of bladder cancer and breast   cancer.

other options :
option B : Degludec is a form of long acting insulin, and is not indicated for the treatment of heart failure.
option C : Linagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which enhances the action of incretins that promote the release of insulin into circulation. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors
enhance the release of insulin postprandially, decrease glucagon, and thereby lower mealtime as     well as fasting glucose. Linagliptin is safe to use in chronic kidney disease as it is cleared primarily by hepatobiliary system, but is not approved for heart failure.
option D : Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione, which activates PPAR-γ receptors in adipose tissue and skeletal muscles. These are insulin sensitizers and increase insulin-mediated glucose uptake     in patients with type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone is currently banned in India as it has shown an
increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, and death.",,A,
Q16,A patient diagnosed with ulcerative colitis presents with 2-3 episodes of bloody stools per day. what should be given to manage this patient ?,"a)Budesonide
b)Azathioprine
c)6-mercaptopurine
d)5-aminosalicylic acid","5-aminosalicylic acid is is effective in inducing and maintaining remission and is considered to be the first line agents for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, seen in this patient with 2-3 bloody
stools per day.
Treatment of ulcerative colitis differs based on the severity of the disease and involves medical and surgical management. Patients with mild to moderate disease are treated with topical or
systemic 5-aminosalicylate drugs such as salazopyrine/sulfasalazine and Mesalamine (5 AsA)     which are first-line therapy. Glucocorticoids (option A), immunosuppressants, and biologics are effective in patients with moderate to severe disease.
Azathioprine and cyclosporin are used as steroid-sparing agents. Anti-TNF alpha inhibitors (infliximab, adalimumab) can be used as anti-inflammatories.
surgery is recommended for patients who do not improve after medical treatment or with toxic megacolon, and perforation. Indications for elective surgery include failure of medical therapy,  growth retardation, extraintestinal disease, and malignant change.
ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease resulting in superficial erosions confined to the mucosa and submucosa of the colon. It starts from the rectum and extends proximally in a
continuous manner. The clinical features include abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding,
tenesmus, and passage of mucus. other symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, and weight loss.
ulcerative colitis is graded based on the frequency of bowel movements and systemic
involvement.
- Mild disease - ≤4 stools per day with/without rectal bleeding;
- Moderate disease - ≥4 stools per day with few systemic signs of illness;
- severe disease - ≥6 blood stools per day with fever, tachycardia (≥9o beats/min), anemia  (hemoglobin &lt;1o.5 g/dL), and elevated levels of inflammatory markers (EsR ≥3o mm/h)
- Fulminant disease - &gt;1o stools per day with severe anemia requiring blood transfusion and progressive colonic dilation (toxic megacolon)

Investigations show elevated C-reactive protein, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin. A colonoscopy reveals loss of typical vascular pattern,   erythema, friability, regenerative mucosal nodules, pseudopolyps, and ulcerations.
Extraintestinal manifestations associated with IBD include ocular features (episcleritis, and uveitis), dermatological manifestations (erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum),
rheumatological (arthropathies, sacroiliitis, ankylosing spondylitis) and primary sclerosing
cholangitis. Complications include toxic megacolon, hemorrhage, strictures, and perforations. These patients are also at increased risk of colon cancer.

option B &amp; C : Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are not first line agents for ulcerative colitis.",,D,
Q17,A 25 year old male patient presents with several purpuric skin lesions and is diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. which of the following tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be used in his condition?,"a)Eltrombopag
b)Romiplostim
c)Bosutinib
d)Fostamatinib","Fostamatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of chronic immune
thrombocytopenia (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura).
Fostamatinib has activity against spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). The major metabolite of
fostamatinib, R406, inhibits signal transduction of Fc-activating receptors and B-cell receptors. The fostamatinib metabolite R406 reduces antibody-mediated destruction of platelets.
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an acquired disorder characterized by the
immune-mediated destruction of platelets and possibly inhibition of platelet release from the megakaryocyte. It is an autoimmune disorder caused by antibodies directed against platelet    membrane glycoproteins IIb-IIIa or Ib-IX. Secondary causes of ITP include systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE), HIV-AIDS, and Hepatitis C.
ITP usually presents with mucocutaneous bleeding, very low platelet count, and normal peripheral blood cells. Patients typically exhibit ecchymoses and petechiae or they may  incidentally discover thrombocytopenia during a routine complete blood count. Rarely,
life-threatening bleeding may occur. The presence of wet purpura (blood blisters in the mouth) and retinal hemorrhages can serve as warning signs of potentially life-threatening bleeding.
The treatment of ITP is as follows:
other options :
option A and B: Eltrombopag and Romiplostim are thrombopoietin (TPo) receptor agonists used in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia which have failed to respond to conventional
treatments. Both drugs act via the Mpl receptor to increase platelet counts and not via tyrosine kinase inhibition.

Q18,"A 4o-year-old woman with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis presents with fatigue,
constipation, weight gain, and neck swelling. which of the following drugs is implicated in this case?","a)pyrazinamide
b)Ethionamide
c)cycloserine
d)streptomycin","The given clinical features are suggestive of hypothyroidism with goiter, which is a known adverse effect of ethionamide.
Mutidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is treated with 2nd line agents that include  ethionamide (ETH). ETH is not a first-line agent due to its gastrointestinal side effects.
Ethionamide inhibits activity of the InhA gene product, resulting in inhibition of mycolic acid
synthesis. It is structurally related to thionamides (propylthiouracil and methimazole) and
therefore causes hypothyroidism by preventing organification of iodine in thyroid hormone
synthesis. Another antitubercular drug that can cause hypothyroidism is para-amino salicylic acid (pAs).
ETH/pAs-induced hypothyroidism should be treated with thyroxine replacement therapy, instead of changing the regimen. Thyroid function usually optimizes within 2 months after completing
MDR therapy.
Ethionamide also causes hepatotoxicity and neurological adverse effects and may require pyridoxine supplementation.
MDR-TB is when there is resistance to atleast isoniazid and rifampicin which are the most potent first-line drugs. The treatment of MDR-TB is curated with drugs grouped into different classes by the world health organization (WHO).
Group A: Levofloxacin, bedaquiline, linezolid
Group B: clofazimine, cycloserine
Group c: Ethambutol, pyrazinamide, delamanid, ethionamide
In patients treated previously or with additional drug resistance, a longer MDR-TB regimen of
18-2o months is recommended. Drugs belonging to group A are preferred along with one drug
from group B whenever possible. A shorter regimen of 6 months including bedaquiline with other

drugs can be used in patients not treated before and without extensive disease. In pregnant women with MRD-TB, drugs such as bedaquiline and delamanid should be avoided.
other options :
option A : pyrazinamide inhibits fatty acid synthase-I leading to inhibition of cell membrane synthesis. pyrazinamide causes hyperuricemia and hepatotoxicity.
option C : Adverse effects of cycloserine are mainly neurological. Half of the patients on cycloserine (1g/day) experience neuropsychiatric symptoms. It ranges from headaches to psychosis, seizures, and suicidal ideas.
option D : streptomycin is an aminoglycoside which binds to the 3os ribosomal subunit and
interferes with the initiation of protein synthesis.  It is a second-line agent for the treatment of
active tuberculosis. streptomycin produces ototoxicity, vestibulotoxicity, optic nerve dysfunction, including scotomas, and peripheral neuritis.",,B,
Q19,A patient on amitriptyline was found in an unconscious state. which of the following does not suggest amitriptyline toxicity?,"a)Arrhythmias
b)confusion
c)Hypothermia
d)Mydriasis","Hypothermia is not associated with amitriptyline use or tricyclic antidepressant toxicity.
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) such as amitriptyline are used in the treatment of psychotic
depression, insomnia, and several pain conditions. Their mechanism of action is inhibition of
norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake. They have a quinidine-like sodium channel blockade
effect on cardiac conduction. Hence, they cause QT prolongation. other cardiotoxic effects include atrioventricular (AV) block and hypotension. Rightward-axis deviation is also an associated
finding.
TCA toxicity can result in ventricular tachyarrhythmias (option A), status epilepticus,
hyperthermia, and coma. It can also result in anticholinergic syndrome due to muscarinic
receptor antagonism. symptoms include dilated pupils (option D), high temperature, confusion (option B), dry mouth, urinary retention, tachycardia, and myoclonic movements. It is managed with intravenous sodium bicarbonate bolus (5o-1oo mEq). This helps in the reversal of sodium   channel blockade. Gastric lavage and administration of activated charcoal can be carried out in   cases of recent ingestion.
other side effects of TCAs include postural hypotension from anti-alpha 1 adrenergic action and sedation from anti-histaminic action. ECG changes such as T wave inversion or suppression are  also common.
In some cases, it can result in polymorphic ventricular tachycardias with QT prolongation known as torsades de pointes. Recurrent episodes can be treated with intravenous magnesium sulfate.",,C,
Q20,which of the following is beneficial in reducing the painful crisis of sickle cell anemia?,"a)Hydroxyurea
b)Methotrexate + leukovorin
c)Methionine
d)Eltrombopag","Hydroxyurea is beneficial in reducing the painful vasoocclusive crisis of sickle cell anemia.
Hydroxyurea is a myelosuppressive agent that is effective in reducing the frequency of painful episodes like dactylitis and acute chest syndrome, decreasing the rate of hospitalization, and    requirement for blood transfusion. It is safe and well-tolerated in children and infants.

Hydroxyurea is approved for long-term maintenance of sickle cell disease, and is recommended for patients of all ages regardless of symptoms.
Hydroxyurea increases fetal hemoglobin levels by an unknown mechanism and interferes with the polymerization of abnormal Hbs.
Newer drugs for management of acute painful crisis of sickle cell anemia include L-glutamine and crizanlizumab. For individuals &gt;5 years of age with sickle cell disease who have pain despite
hydroxyurea (or who cannot tolerate hydroxyurea), L-glutamine is recommended, regardless of
whether they are receiving hydroxyurea. The mechanism of action of this drug, is that it reduces     oxidative stress in sickle erythrocytes. crizanlizumab is a P-selectin-blocking monoclonal antibody which is given intravenously every month to reduce acute painful episodes.
sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder that occurs due to the point mutation in the   β-globin gene which results in the replacement of glutamate residue with valine. This causes the     production of sickle-shaped red blood cells due to the polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hbs). Factors that predispose to sickling are infection, dehydration, and acidosis. sickle cell
disease causes hemolytic anemia due to increased erythrocyte destruction. The anemia is
generally well compensated. complications occur due to abnormal erythrocyte configurations that increase hemoglobin polymerization leading to a painful vaso-occlusive state.
clinical features of sickle cell anemia :
- Moderately severe hemolytic anemia with jaundice.
- Painful bone crisis : hand-foot syndrome or dactylitis of the bones of hands and feet.
- Acute chest syndrome typically presents with fever, cough, chest pain, and pulmonary infiltrates.
- Hyposthenuria : inability to concentrate urine.
- Aplastic crisis stems from the infection of red cell progenitors by parvovirus B19, which causes a transient cessation of erythropoiesis and a sudden worsening of the anemia.
- spleen : In children, splenic sequestration crises occur which results in splenomegaly due to red pulp congestion. In adolescence or early adulthood, autosplenectomy occurs due to splenic
infarction, fibrosis, and progressive shrinkage.
- Increased susceptibility to infection with encapsulated organisms like pneumococcal,
meningococcal, and Haemophilus influenza septicemia, but can be reduced by vaccination and prophylactic antibiotics.
- other clinical features include priapism, leg ulcers, stroke, retinopathy, pigment gallstones, and growth retardation.
other options :
option B : Methotrexate interferes with folate metabolism by acting as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. This starves cells for tetrahydrofolate and makes them
unable to synthesize purines and thymidine monophosphate. It does not treat painful crisis of sickle cell anemia.
option c : Methionine is an essential amino acid involved in the synthesis of folate and vitamin B12. It is not used in the management of sickle cell anemia.
option D : Eltrombopag is a thrombopoetin analog used to treat immune thrombocytopenia. It is not used in the treatment of painful sickle cell crisis.",,A,
Q21,what is the most useful drug to treat doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity?,"a)Dexrazoxane
b)Dexamethasone
c)Aprepitant
d)Amifostine","Dexrazoxane is the drug of choice to treat doxorubicin induced cardiomyopathy.
Doxorubicin is an anthracycline group of anticancer antibiotics that acts by inhibiting
topoisomerase II, and is known to cause cardiotoxicity. Dexrazoxane is a cardioprotective iron-chelating agent that is indicated for use along with high dose doxorubicin to avoid
cardiotoxicity.
Dexrazoxane is currently approved to prevent or reduce anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in
women with metastatic breast cancer who have received a total cumulative dose of doxorubicin of 3oo mg/m2 .
Doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy takes two forms:
- Acute: pericarditis-myocarditis syndrome, arrhythmias, ST and T wave changes in ECG. occurs within the first 2–3 days, is transient and in most cases asymptomatic.
- Chronic: Dose dependendent dilated cardiomyopathy associated with heart failure.
Doxorubicin, daunorubicin and epirubicin share similar cardiotoxicity profile. Idarubicin has least cardiotoxicity when compared to other anthracyclines.
Endomyocardial biopsy showing vacuolar degeneration and myofibrillar loss is seen in
cardiotoxicity due to anthracyclines.
Difference between cardiotoxicity due to anthracyclins and trastuzumab:
Anthracyclines like doxorubicin can result in a radiation recall reaction, where erythema and
desquamation of skin are observed at sites of previous radiation injury. The risk of cardiotoxicity also increases with previous irradiation. Therefore, careful monitoring and dosage adjustments    are required for doxorubicin.
other options :
option B, C and D : Dexamethasone, aprepitant and amifostine are not used in the management of anthracycline induced cardiotoxicity.

Q22,An elderly patient with dementia is not compliant with oral medications. which of the following will be beneficial in this case?,"a)Donepezil
b)Rivastigmine
c)Galantamine
d)Memantine","Rivastigmine transdermal patch can be prescribed to patients with dementia who are non compliant on oral medications.

Rivastigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that is available as a transdermal patch for use in  alzheimer's disease and dementia. It can be applied for over 24 hours. Transdermal delivery reduces the fluctuation and avoids direct gastric irritation effects associated with oral
formulations.
Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. The characteristic  feature of Alzheimer's is the degeneration of cholinergic neurons leading to reduced levels of acetylcholine.
Treatment includes cholinesterase inhibitors like Donepezil, Rivastigmine and Galantamine and NMDA receptor antagonist like memantine. The cholinesterase inhibitors cause significant side
effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and peripheral cholinergic effects, which can be avoided by using a transdermal formulation.

Q23,sodium valproate has an inhibitory action at which of the following sites?,"a)A
b)B
c)C
d)D","sodium valproate has an inhibitory action on the metabolism and degradation of GABA, and also increases its synthesis.
valproate is an anti-epileptic medication and also used as a mood stabilizer in bipolar disorder.    valproate acts via multiple mechanisms. It blocks both sodium and calcium channels. It prolongs sodium channel inactivation and attenuates calcium-mediated 'T' current. It inhibits metabolism   and degradation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and increases its synthesis from
glutamic acid (option A). It also inhibits excitatory NMDA glutamate receptors. The repetitive firing caused by the depolarization of cortical or spinal cord neurons is inhibited by valproate.
valproate is a broad spectrum antiseizure drug used in partial seizures, generalised tonic-clonic
seziures (GTcs), absence seizures, myoclonic seziures and atonic seziures. It can be used in
absence seizures, but it is preferred when the child also suffers from GTcs. It is the drug of choice for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

The side effects of valproate (mnemonic: vALPRoATE)
vomiting
Alopecia
Liver toxicity
Pancreatitis

It causes congenital anomalies like neural tube defects (spina Bifida), clefts, and cardiac
anomalies. The intelligence quotient score of school-going children who were exposed in utero to valproate is found reduced. It also contributes to poor cognitive development in children. Folate  supplementation reduces the chances of neural tube defects.
other options :
option C : Drugs such as vigabatrine and tiagabine inhibit GABA reuptake by inhibiting the GABA reuptake transporter. vigabatrine is the drug of choice for infantile spasms (west syndrome) seen  in tuberous sclerosis.
option D : Flumazenil acts as an antagonist at the GABA receptor and is used as an antidote for benzodiazepine overdose. Benzodiazepines act by promoting GABA inhibition by binding to the  GABA receptor itself and inhibiting nerve transmission.",1253-789.PNG,B,
Q24,which of the following drugs acts via the ATP-binding cassette transporter?,"a)verapamil
b)Diltiazem
c)Nifedipine
d)Amlodipine","verapamil is a potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein drug transporter which belongs to the family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.
A group of primary active transporters, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family, hydrolyze ATP to export substrates across membranes. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporter, which acts as an efflux membrane transporter. It is responsible for limiting cellular
uptake and the distribution of xenobiotics and toxic substances. P-glycoprotein is also called
ABCB1 or MDR1, and it exports bulky neutral or cationic compounds from cells. MDR1 exports
many drugs as well. It is associated with multidrug resistance (MDR) to cancer chemotherapeutics through the multidrug resistance protein 1 or MDR1.
verapamil can cause interactions with drugs whose disposition is dependent upon P-glycoprotein. Drugs that inhibit P-glycoprotein are -
• Clarithromycin
• Erythromycin
• Amiodarone

• Quinidine
• verapamil
• Diltiazem
• Cyclosporine
• Itraconazole
• Propafenone
• Flecainide.
P-glycoprotein pumps play a major role in the elimination of certain drugs such as digoxin. Drugs that inhibit P-glycoprotein can thereby decrease their elimination and lead to toxicity. For eg,
digoxin is metabolized by P-glycoprotein, and drugs that inhibit it increase the plasma levels of digoxin and may result in toxicity.
Increased P-gp expression: Reduces the absorption of drugs that are substrates for P-gp.
Decreased P-gp expression: Leads to supratherapeutic plasma concentrations and drug toxicity. other options :
option B, C, and D: Although diltiazem, nifedipine, and amlodipine have been reported in the  literature to act as p-glycoprotein inhibitors, verapamil is more potent and commonly used for p-glycoprotein inhibition in trials, and would be the best answer.",,A,
Q25,A 12 year old boy presents with complaints of profuse watery stools and an elevated wBC  count of 16ooo cells/mm3. He has been on treatment with amoxicillin for the past 1 week. what is the treatment of choice for his condition?,"a)Fidaxomycin
b)Clindamycin
c)zanamivir
d)Cilastatin","oral Fidaxomicin is the antibiotic indicated for this patient's condition which is suggestive of Clostridium difficile infection, characterized by profuse watery diarrhea
and leukocytosis following long term antibiotic use such as ampicillin.
C difficle infection is most commonly associated with prolonged antimicrobial use which
interferes with the commensal colonic microflora. The most commonly implicated antibiotics are cephalosporins, ampicillin, clindamycin, and fluoroquinolones. spores of toxigenic C.
difficile when ingested, survive gastric acidity and colonize the lower intestinal tract. Here they produce two toxins: toxin A (an enterotoxin) and toxin B (a cytotoxin). These toxins initiate
processes that disrupt the epithelial-cell barrier function, diarrhea, and pseudomembrane formation. The patient presents with non bloody diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, and
leukocytosis.
Clinical features can range from asymptomatic carriage to fulminant colitis.
• Nonsevere disease - watery diarrhea (≥3 loose stools in 24 hours) is the cardinal
symptom. other manifestations include lower abdominal pain and cramping, low-grade fever, nausea, anorexia, mucus, or occult blood in the stool. Physical examination may demonstrate  lower abdominal tenderness. unexplained leukocytosis in hospitalized patients (even in the      absence of diarrhea) may reflect underlying CDI
• severe colitis - Clinical manifestations of severe colitis include diarrhea, lower quadrant or diffuse abdominal pain, abdominal distention, fever, hypovolemia, lactic acidosis,
hypoalbuminemia, elevated creatinine, and marked leukocytosis.

• Fulminant colitis - Characterized by hypotension or shock, ileus, or megacolon.
• Recurrent disease - resolution of CDI followed by recurrence of symptoms within two to eight weeks after treatment has been stopped
Nucleic acid amplification tests including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, for C.
difficile toxin A or B gene in stool, are widely used diagnostically. Glutamate dehydrogenase is an enzyme immunoassay to detect C. difficile in stool. Confirmation of the presence of toxin in the     stool in addition to PCR or glutamate dehydrogenase positivity is recommended.
oral vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and metronidazole are used in the management of this
condition. Fidaxomicin acts by inhibiting protein synthesis through the blockade of RNA polymerase.
Management of nonsevere to severe initial disease:
Management of recurrent disease:
Management offulminant disease - other options:
option B : Clindamycin is implicated as a risk factor for development of clostridium difficile colitis and is not used to treat it.

b)valproate
c)carbamazepine
d)Topiramate","valproate is a mood stabilizer with the side effect of hepatotoxicity and hyperammonemia.

valproate is an anti-epileptic medication and also used as a mood stabilizer in manic episodes as well as in bipolar disorder. The repetitive firing caused by the depolarization of cortical or spinal cord neurons is inhibited by valproate. It also prolongs the sodium channel inactivation.
valproate can cause an idiosyncratic hepatic toxicity and interfere with conversion of ammonia to urea leading to hyperammonemia. valproate is contraindicated in patients with genetic defects in urea metabolism.
valproate therapy reduces carnitine levels in tissues, potentially impacting mitochondrial function and leading to hyperammonemia and microvesicular steatosis. Genetic factors also play a role, as   individuals who are heterozygous for mutations in the gamma polymerase gene, which is
primarily present in mitochondria, are more susceptible to valproate-induced liver damage. Intravenous administration of carnitine can be used to manage this condition.

Q27,which of the following pathogens is correctly matched with its intrinsic drug resistance?,"a)Aspergillus niger - voriconazole
b)candida krusei - Fluconazole
c)candida Glabrata - Amphotericin B
d)sporothrix - Itraconazole","Among the given options, Candida krusei shows an intrinsic resistance to fluconazole.
The primary or intrinsic resistance of C. krusei to azoles (fluconazole and itraconazole) is
mediated through reduced susceptibility of the target enzyme (lanosterol 14α-demethylase) to
inhibition by these drugs. However, improved susceptibility is seen with newer generation azoles such as voriconazole.
Life-threatening systemic infections caused by Candida and Aspergillus species are usually seen in severely ill and immunocompromised patients such as HIV, chemotherapy-induced neutropenia,   and transplant recipients on immunosuppressants. C. albicans and C. dubliniensis are most
susceptible to currently available azoles, C. glabrata is less susceptible, whereas C. krusei is
intrinsically resistant to fluconazole. Resistance occurs due to overexpression or point mutation in the gene encoding the target enzyme lanosterol 14α-demethylase. Voriconazole is the preferred
therapy for multi-drug resistant infection with C. krusei.
C. albicans and C. glabrata (option C) showing resistance to Amphotericin B has been increasingly reported over the past several years. But this is a secondary resistance due to alteration or a
decrease in the amount of ergosterol in the cell membrane. Amphotericin B is indicated to treat C. glabrata that has developed resistance to azoles.
Aspergillus fumigatus, the most common species to cause Aspergillus infection worldwide, also shows an intrinsic resistance to fluconazole. It is susceptible to echinocandins like micafungin,  which acts by inhibiting beta-(1,3)-D-glucan synthase, an enzyme necessary for the synthesis of the cell wall.
other options
option A : Aspergillus niger is a common cause of otomycosis and is susceptible to azoles like voriconazole, amphotericin B, and echinocandins.
option D : The drug of choice for treatment of sporotrichosis is itraconazole.",,B,
Q28,A child was receiving a blood transfusion. At what serum iron level will desferrioxamine be administered to him?,"a)35o mcg/dL
b)4oo mcg/dL
c)45o mcg/dL
d)5oo mcg/dL","IV desferrioxamine (also known as deferoxamine) is indicated when serum iron levels are greater than 5oo mcg/dL in cases of iron toxicity.
Desferrioxamine is selectively used as a chelating agent to manage cases of acute iron poisoning, hemochromatosis, and patients with iron overload from repetitive blood transfusions.
Desferrioxamine can be administered intramuscularly, intravenously, or subcutaneously but not orally.
Deferiprone and deferasirox are both oral drugs and can be given in transfusion related siderosis   but are less effective than desferrioxamine. Although, they can be preferred because of the ease of administration through oral route and multiple transfusions required for beta thalassemia
patients.
Iron exhibits toxic effects by hydration of the ferric (F3+) ion which generates H+. Non transferrin bound iron catalyses free radical formation which causes mitochondrial injury, lipid peroxidation, increased capillary permeability, vasodilation, and organ toxicity.

Clinical features of iron toxicity include initial nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. In severe cases there is high anion gap metabolic acidosis, cardiovascular and CNS depression,
hepatitis, coagulopathy, and seizures.
In the case of toxic iron ingestion, radiopaque iron tablets may be seen on abdominal x-ray.
Management of iron toxicity includes the following :
• whole-bowel irrigation for large ingestions, endoscopy and gastrostomy if clinical toxicity and large number of tablets are still visible on x-ray.
• IV hydration.
• Sodium bicarbonate for acidemia.
• IV desferrioxamine for systemic toxicity, iron level &gt;9o μmol/L (5oo μg/dL).",,D,
Q29,"A patient on fluoxetine was started on a pain control drug for neuropathic pain. He developed an episode of syncope after 2 weeks. EcG reveals QT interval of 477 ms. which of the
following is the causative drug?","a)Methadone
b)Morphine
c)Meperidine
d)propoxyphene","Methadone is the causative drug for this patient's presentation of syncope and prolonged QT interval after coadministration other QT prolonging drugs such as fluoxetine.
Unlike other opioids, QT prolongation is primarily a side effect of methadone, which is additive
with other agents known to cause QT prolongation such as fluoxetine. Serious cardiac arrhythmias including torsades de pointes have been noted with methadone use. Normal QTc is about 44o ms. Values of more than 44o ms in males and 46o ms in females are considered to be prolonged. QT    prolongation can present as syncope or cardiac arrest.
Methadone is a synthetic opioid that is chemically different but has similar pharmacological
action to that of morphine (option B). It is a long-acting mu-opioid receptor agonist. Although an effective analgesic, the primary use of methadone hydrochloride is detoxification and
maintenance therapy treatment for opioid use disorder. Methadone is also used for the
management of chronic pain.
Side effects of methadone are similar to that of morphine such as lethargy, constipation,
respiratory depression, and hypotension. Like other opioids, methadone will produce tolerance
and dependence. Development of physical dependence during the long-term administration of
methadone can be demonstrated following abrupt drug withdrawal or administration of an opioid antagonist.
other options :
option B : Morphine is not associated with QT prolongation.
option C : Meperidine, also known as pethidine, though chemically unrelated to morphine
interacts with µ opioid receptors and its actions are blocked by naloxone. Apart from usual opioid side effects, pethidine produces some atropinic effects like dry mouth, blurred vision, tachycardia. pethidine injected in patients receiving a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) may
produce serotonin syndrome. It is occasionally used to control shivering during recovery from anaesthesia.
option D : propoxyphene is a methadone analogue that was used to treat mild-tomoderate pain. Due to reports of cardiotoxicity, it was withdrawn in Uk, Europe, and USA and it was banned in India in 2o13.",,A,
Q30,All of the following side effects are more commonly seen with carbamazepine than oxcarbazepine except,"a)Rashes
b)Hyponatremia
c)Blood dyscrasia
d)Hepatitis","Hyponatremia occurs more frequently in the case of oxcarbazepine than carbamazepine.
Both carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are sodium-channel blockers that stabilize neuronal
membranes. oxcarbazepine is the 1o-keto analog of carbamazepine and and cannot form an
epoxide metabolite. carbamazepine potentiates the action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). It can result in water retention with decreased osmolarity and hyponatremia, especially in elderly
patients with cardiac disease. Although hyponatremia may occur more commonly with
oxcarbazepine than with carbamazepine, most adverse effects of oxcarbazepine are similar to those of carbamazepine.
carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine can cause leukopenia, aplastic anemia, hepato-toxicity in the elderly.
oxcarbazepine shows lesser hypersensitivity reaction. Hence, rashes (option A) are more commonly seen with carbamazepine than with oxcarbazepine.
studies have shown that carbamazepine elevates enzyme gamma-glutamyl transpeptidases (GGT) more frequently than oxcarbazepine because of enzyme P45o induction. Hepatotoxicity from
oxcarbazepine occurs less commonly compared to carbamazepine (option D).
side effects of carbamazepine therapy include: mnemonic: HEADs
Hypersensitivity reactions
Eosinophilia
Agranulocytosis: report symptoms like sore throat/fever
Aplastic anemia
Ataxia
Dilutional hyponatremia
Diplopia, blurred vision
splenomegaly
stevens-Johnson syndrome
carbamazepine is most effective in complex partial seizures. It is also used in GTcs and simple partial seizures, trigeminal and related neuralgias, and manic depressive psychosis.
oxcarbazepine has been used to treat intractable trigeminal neuralgia refractory to other anticonvulsants.

Q31,"A patient with hemophilia on antiretroviral therapy is brought in altered mental status
following complaints of nausea, vomiting and headache. which of the following medications was he taking?","a)Lopinavir
b)Tipranavir
c)Darunavir
d)Ritonavir","This patient was most likely taking tipranavir, as it is known to be associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage and hepatotoxicity which is the likely cause of altered mental     status in this patient with hemophilia following complaints of nausea, vomiting and headache.
Tipranavir is a protease inhibitor (pI) used in patients who are resistant to other pIs. It is often     combined with ritonavir, to achieve better therapeutic outcomes. It should be avoided in patients with head trauma or bleeding diathesis, such as hemophilia as it is associated with an increased   risk of intracranial hemorrhage. other common adverse effects of tipranavir include nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, urticarial or maculopapular rash, and liver toxicity.
other options :
option A, c and D : Lopinavir, Darunavir and Ritonavir are protease inhibitors that can cause  nausea and vomiting, although they are not contraindicated in patients with bleeding diathesis and not associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage.
The illustration below shows the mechanism of action of various antiretroviral drugs.

Q32,"A 6o-year-old patient with chronic kidney disease suddenly develops chest pain and
palpitations. He had previously complained about feeling weak for the past week. Serum potassium was found to be 6.5mEq/L. which of the following is likely to be found in this patients ECG?","a)Tall peaked T waves
b)Flat T waves
c)Tall QRS complexes
d)prolonged pR intervals","A chronic kidney disease (CKD) patient with chest pain, palpitations, muscle weakness, and serum potassium of 6.4mEq/L indicates hyperkalemia.
Hyperkalemia can be defined as potassium levels &gt;5.5 mM. In normal patients, hyperkalemia is prevented by aldosterone-dependent secretion and potassium excretion via the gastrointestinal
tract. But in patients with CKD, certain situations overcome these preventive mechanisms and
cause hyperkalemia. These include high potassium intake, hemolysis, red blood cell transfusion,   metabolic acidosis, and drugs that inhibit potassium excretion. The most common drugs that can precipitate hyperkalemia in CKD patients are renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors,
spironolactone, and other potassium-sparing diuretics like triamterene, eplerenone, and amiloride.

ECG shows tall and peaked T waves, widening of QRS complexes, loss of p waves, and sine wave pattern.


Management of hyperkalemia involves an immediate reversal of cardiac effects by administration of 1omL of 1o% calcium gluconate intravenously. This leads to the reversal of the depolarization   blockade due to hyperkalemia. Redistributing the excess potassium by administering 1oU of
intravenous insulin followed by 5omL of 5o% dextrose can also be given, as insulin facilitates the intracellular shift of potassium. Beta-2-agonists can also be used in the management of
hyperkalemia. But patients with end-stage renal disease are resistant to beta-2-agonists and hence must be used with caution. Removal of potassium can be done using cation exchange resins like     patiromer and sodium polystyrene sulfonate, diuretics, and dialysis.",,A,1284-791.PNG
Q33,"which of the following drugs can be used in diabetic neuropathy, post herpetic neuralgia and spinal cord injury?","a)Amitriptyline
b)phenytoin
c)carbamazepine
d)pregabalin","pregabalin can be used for diabetic neuropathy, post herpetic neuralgia and spinal cord injury. Although amitriptyline can also be used for these conditions, pregabalin is found to be
recommended over amitriptyline considering safety and efficacy and hence is the best option.
pregabalin is an anti-epileptic drug. Its analgesic effect is mediated by binding to α2δ , a protein  that is a subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels and causes a decrease in glutamate release at excitatory synapses. Decreased neurotransmitter release is associated with reduced neuronal
hyperexcitability. It is used in the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, spinal cord injury or postherpetic neuralgia.
Currently, only duloxetine and pregabalin are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration and the European Medicines Agency to treat painful diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic Neuropathy is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy in developed countries. Risk
factors include long-standing, poorly controlled DM and the presence of retinopathy and nephropathy.
Side effects of pregabalin include sedation and peripheral edema.

other options :
option A : Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) such as amitriptyline are used in the treatment of
several pain conditions such as diabetic neuropathy, post herpetic neuralgia and following spinal cord injury. Their mechanism of action is inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake.
Although both pregabalin and amitriptyline are among the first line drugs for neuropathic pain, amitriptyline would be the next best option in this question, owing to its side effect profile and
good yet controversial efficacy in pain control. It is a non FDA approved drug for diabetic
neuropathy (off label indication). Side effects associated with amitriptyline include anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, tachycardia, hyperthermia), cardiac effects (arrhythmias) and sedation.
option B : Phenytoin is an antiepileptic drug that is not used in the treatment of pain.
option C : Carbamazepine is an iminostilbine derivative. It blocks voltage-activated sodium
channels, slowing their rate of recovery and limiting the repetitive firing of action potentials. It is used in the treatment of generalized, focal-to-bilateral and idiopathic tonic-clonic seizures, focal   seizures, neuropathic pain associated with trigeminal and glossopharyngeal neuralgias.",,D,
Q34,which of the following antibiotics acts by inhibiting the 5os ribosome?,"a)Aztreonam
b)Daptomycin
c)Linezolid
d)Rifampicin","Linezolid is a protein synthesis inhibitor that acts by inhibiting the 5os ribosomal subunit.
Linezolid binds to the P site of the 5os ribosomal subunit and inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. It is an oxazolidinone that is active against various resistant organisms including MRSA. It has
excellent oral bioavailability. Linezolid is used to treat infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, particularly vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.    Linezolid is also approved for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia due to S.
pneumoniae and nosocomial pneumonia due to S. aureus.
The intrinsic resistance of gram-negative bacteria to linezolid is mediated by endogenous efflux pumps.
Linezolid is associated with the side effect of myelosuppression (anemia, leukopenia,
pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia). Thrombocytopenia is the most common side effect.
Linezolid has MAoI (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) activity and therefore can precipitate serotonin syndrome with concomitant use of SSRI (paroxetine) or with other serotonergic medications.
other adverse effects include peripheral neuropathy, optic neuropathy, lactic acidosis.
other options :
option A : Aztreonam is a monobactam, and acts similar to penicillin by inhibiting peptiglycan crosslinking and inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis.
option B : Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic. It acts by depolarising bacterial
membranes resulting in loss of membrane potential and cell death.
option D : Rifampicin is an anti tubercular antibiotic that acts by inhibiting bacterial
DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.",,C,1286-792.PNG
