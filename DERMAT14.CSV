Q1,which of the following is not associated with annular lesions?,"a)Tinea corporis
b)pityriasis rosea
c)urticaria
d)porokeratosis","urticaria is not associated with annular lesions. It is characterized by wheals.
urticaria is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by itchy wheals, which develop due to evanescent edema of dermis.
A weal is a descriptive term for transient, well■demarcated, superficial pink or pale swellings of the dermis due to reversible exudation of plasma in the skin that fade, usually within hours,
without leaving a mark . weals are usually very itchy and associated with a surrounding red flare when they arise. Lesions begin as erythematous macules, which rapidly evolve into pale pink
edematous wheals with a surrounding flare.
option A: Tinea corporis/ ringworm infection is caused by the
dermatophyte Trichophyton rubrum. It results from invasion and proliferation of the causal fungi



in the stratum corneum with lesions on the trunk and limbs. characteristic lesions are circular, usually sharply marginated with a raised edge with central resolution.
option B: pityriasis Rosea (pR) is an unknown etiology, self-limiting condition that typically lasts between 2 to 1o weeks. It is characterized by a herald patch, followed by a secondary eruption
with typical lesions that are oval, annular, erythematous, and plaque-like with a collarette of
scales. These lesions commonly appear on the trunk in a ""fir tree"" pattern along lines of cleavage. Differential diagnoses include guttate psoriasis, secondary syphilis, and drug rash. There is no
specific treatment for pR; symptomatic treatment is usually sufficient.
option D: porokeratosis is a clonal expansion of keratinocytes which differentiate abnormally. But they are not hyperproliferative. It may present as single or multiple lesions and may be localized    or disseminated. porokeratoses present with single or multiple papules or plaques which develop   into annular lesions with a thin raised border.",,C,
Q2,Match the following,"a)a-3, b-4, c-2, d-1
b)a-1, b-4, c-2, d-3
c)a-3, b-2, c-4, d-1
d)a-2, b-4, c-3, d-1","The correctly matched option is a-3, b-4, c-2, d-1.
Lupus vulgaris is one of the prevalent forms of cutaneous tuberculosis that occurs in previously sensitized individuals with high immunity. It is characterized by reddish-brown papules and
slow-growing plaques with elevated borders and central atrophy. Diagnosis is made by biopsy.
caseating granulomas are pathognomonic of tuberculosis.
Tinea corporis/ ringworm infection is caused by the dermatophyte Trichophyton rubrum. It
results from invasion and proliferation of the causal fungi in the stratum corneum with lesions on the trunk and limbs. characteristic lesions are circular, usually sharply marginated with a raised    edge with central resolution.
KoH mount is used for the diagnosis. Branching hyphae are seen in Tinea corporis.
Leprosy is a chronic granulomatous condition caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It affects the skin, cutaneous and peripheral nerves, and mucous membranes.
cardinal signs for the diagnosis of leprosy:
• characteristic skin lesions- hypopigmented or erythematous lesions with definite impairment of sensation.
• peripheral nerve involvement- thickening of the nerve with sensory impairment. Nerve tenderness can also be seen.
• Detection of acid-fast bacilli in slit-skin smear, skin biopsy, or positive biopsy pcR.
Allergic contact dermatitis is an eczematous reaction that occurs as an immunological response
that occurs due to exposure to a substance towards which the immune system has previously been sensitized.
The patch test is used to detect delayed (type IV) hypersensitivity to antigens that come in contact with the skin, by applying the suspected antigen under occlusive patches to the skin. patches
are removed after 48 hours (or sooner if there is itching and burning).
• 48 hours: patch removal for initial reading to detect delayed hypersensitivity reaction.



• 72-96 hours: Final reading done for confirmation. An image showing the patch test:

Q3,A hypopigmented patch which grows initially and stops progressing after sometime is seen in which type of vitiligo?,"a)Focal
b)segmental
c)Mixed
d)Acrofacial","In segmental vitiligo, lesions increase initially (6–12 months) and then remain static.
vitiligo is a localized depigmentation that occurs due to a progressive loss in the melanocytes in the basal layer of skin. It is classified as
• segmental vitiligo- which appears as unilateral maculae in a segmented or band-shaped pattern
• Non-segmental vitiligo- which appears as bilateral maculae distributed in an acrofacial pattern or scattered symmetrically over the entire body. Non-segmental can either be focal vitiligo or
undetermined/unclassified vitiligo.
Acrofacial vitiligo is a type of generalized vitiligo, predominantly seen periorificially (around eyes  and on lips on the face) and acral parts (periungual area, palms, and soles). This type of vitiligo is more resistant to therapy due to absence of hair in the affected parts.
Mixed vitiligo: the coexistence of non■segmental and segmental vitiligo in one patient is called
mixed vitiligo
According to a recent vitiligo Global Issue consensus conference, the term ‘vitiligo’ can be used     as an umbrella term for all non■segmental forms of vitiligo (including several variants: acrofacial,



mucosal, generalized, universal, mixed, and rare variants of vitiligo). The classification is shown below.
clinical features:
The lesions become apparent between 2o-3o years of age.
Hypopigmented macules in vitiligo are commonly found in the hips, dorsum of the hands/fingers, feet, elbows, knees, and ankle areas. These are the areas of repeated friction. koebner
phenomenon is seen, which is the development of lesions at the site of trauma on the uninvolved skin.
vitiligo universalis, which is complete vitiligo, or trichrome vitiligo where there are areas of depigmentation, hyperpigmentation, as well as areas of normal skin may be seen rarely.
several autoimmune conditions can be associated with vitiligo. They are:
• Thyroid disease (hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism)
• pernicious anemia
• Addison disease
• Diabetes
• Hypoparathyroidism Examination:
under the wood's lamp examination the depigmented areas emit a bright blue-white fluorescence and appear sharply demarcated.
Treatment:
Treatment involves cosmetic camouflage and the use of sunscreen. The topical application of
corticosteroids is the first line of treatment. Topical calcineurin inhibitors like pimecrolimus,
tacrolimus have also shown to be successful. psoralen photochemotherapy, khellin, selective
ultraviolet B therapy are used as second-line treatment. In patients who do not respond to this
treatment, surgical grafting techniques can be used, where the melanocytes from a normal
pigmented area are transferred to a non pigmented area. In patients with extensive vitiligo where only a few pigmented areas are left, depigmentation can be done.

Q4,what is the mechanism responsible for the release of secretions from the gland seen in the image below?,"a)Apocrine
b)Merocrine
c)Eccrine
d)Holocrine","The gland depicted in the image is a sebaceous gland, which releases its secretions through the holocrine mechanism.
Identification features of sebaceous gland:
• Lobular structure with clusters of cells.
• Foamy cytoplasm due to lipid content.
• Holocrine secretion with disintegrated cells.
• Found near hair follicles in the dermis.
sebaceous gland cells synthesize and accumulate lipid-rich sebum within their cytoplasm.
Holocrine secretions are produced in the cytoplasm of the cell and released by the rupture of the plasma membrane, which destroys the cell and results in the secretion of the product into the
lumen.
Examples of holocrine glands are
• sebaceous glands of the skin and
• Meibomian glands of the eyelid
other options:
option A: Apocrine: involves partial loss of the apical portion of the cell (e.g., mammary glands).
option B: Merocrine: involves secretion via exocytosis (e.g. sweat glands).
option c: Eccrine glands are a type of sweat gland responsible for thermoregulation through the secretion of sweat. They use the merocrine mechanism for secretion.",3725-2392.PNG,D,
Q5,"All are a part of NAME syndrome, a subset of carneyls complex, except?","a)Atrial myxoma
b)Nevi
c)Ebstein anamoly
d)Myxoid neurofibroma","Ebstein anomaly is not a part of NAME syndrome.
carney complex is a rare, autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by multiple
neoplasms and lentigines. It includes features like cardiac myxomas, endocrine tumors, spotty
skin pigmentation, and other benign or malignant tumors, caused by mutations in the PRKAR1A gene. It includes:
• Myxomas - cardiac, skin, and/or breast
• Lentigines and/or pigmented nevi
• Endocrine overactivity - primary nodular adrenal cortical disease, testicular tumors, and/or pituitary adenomas with gigantism or acromegaly
NAME syndrome and LAMB syndrome are synonymous with the carney complex:
• LAMB - Lentigines, Atrial Myxoma, and Blue nevi.
• NAME syndrome is a subset of carney’s complex, which is a rare autosomal dominant disorder    characterized by multiple neoplasms and pigmentation abnormalities. The acronym NAME stands for:
• Nevi



• Atrial myxomas
• Myxoid neurofibromas
• Ephelides (freckle-like pigmented lesions)",,C,3731-2394.PNG
Q6,"A 6o-year-old woman presented with a great toe infection. she had significant discoloration of the toenail with a subungual hyperkeratosis that caused color alteration and a rough
surface area. she was suspected to have onychomycosis. which topical drug is given for toenail onychomycosis?","a)caspofungin
b)Itraconazole
c)Griseofulvin
d)Tavaborole","Tavaborole is the topical drug given in toenail onychomycosis.
Tavaborole is a topical antifungal. It is an oxaborole antifungal that inhibits fungal protein synthesis by targeting leucyl-tRNA synthetase.
onychomycosis is defined as the infection of the nail plate by fungus.
Most common cause is Trichophyton rubrum, but many fungi may be causative.
The clinical scenario of Tinea unguium presents with yellowish discolouration, which spreads proximally as a streak in the nail. Later, subungual hyperkeratosis becomes prominent and
spreads until the entire nail is affected. Gradually, the entire nail becomes brittle and separated from its bed.





Diagnosis is made by KoH mount examination of dystrophic subungual debris.
Management of onychomycosis involves oral terbinafine as the treatment of choice for Tinea
unguium or onychomycosis. It acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of squalene epoxidase, which is essential in the synthesis of fungal ergosterol. oral terbinafine at 25o mg/day is given for 6 weeks  for fingernail infection and 3 months (12 weeks) for toenail infection. An oral Griseofulvin dose of 1 g/day for 4–8 months (longer for toenails) is used as a second-line treatment.
other options:
option A: caspofungin: caspofungin is an echinocandin antifungal that works by inhibiting fungal cell wall synthesis. It is used in intravenous form for systemic fungal infections like candidiasis
and aspergillosis.
option B: Itraconazole: Itraconazole is an oral antifungal from the triazole class, used for onychomycosis due to its penetration into keratinised tissues.
option c: Griseofulvin: Griseofulvin is an oral antifungal used for dermatophyte infections, including onychomycosis.",,D,3732-2395.PNG
Q7,A male patient presents with urethritis. It can be caused by all except?,"a)Neisseria Gonorrhea
b)Gardenella vaginalis
c)Trichomonas vaginalis
d)Mycoplasma","Gardenella vaginalis does not cause urethritis in male patients.
urethritis is classified into two types:
• Gonococcal urethritis - caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae(option A)
• Non-gonococcal urethritis - caused by:
• chlamydia trachomatis (most common)
• ureaplasma urealyticum
• Trichomonas vaginalis (rare) (option c)



• Herpes simplex virus (rare)
• Mycoplasma genitalium (option D)
The most likely causative organism for acute urethritis in males is Neisseria gonorrhoeae.",,B,
