Q7,The single most important long-term limitation of cardiac transplantation is ________,"a)Allograft rejection
b)Allograft arteriopathy
c)Infection
d)Malignancy","The single most important long-term limitation of cardiac transplantation is allograft
arteriopathy.
Complications following cardiac transplantation:



Allograft rejection: It is the primary concern that requires close surveillance. Both classic cellular rejection and antibody-mediated rejection is recognized. cellular rejection is characterized by
interstitial lymphocytic inflammation, with associated myocyte damage.
Allograft arteriopathy: It is the single most important long-term limitation for cardiac
transplantation. It is a late, progressive, diffusely stenosing intimal proliferation in the coronary arteries, leading to ischemic injury. It can lead to silent myocardial infarction since transplant     patients have denervated hearts and do not experience angina. Progressive congestive heart
failure and sudden cardiac death can also occur.
other postoperative problems include infection and malignancies, especially Epstein–Barr virus-associated B-cell lymphomas.
The image given below shows allograft arteriopathy. There is severe diffuse concentric intimal thickening producing critical stenosis. The internal elastic lamina and media are intact (Movat pentachrome stain, elastin black)",,B,1939-1215.PNG

b)carcinoma of body of pancreas often present with jaundice
c)They elicit intense desmoplastic response
d)perineural invasion is common","patients with carcinoma of the head of the pancreas develop jaundice due to obstruction of the biliary tract.
cigarette smoking doubles the risk of pancreatic cancer and is the leading preventable cause. The clinical features depend on the location of the tumor.
• Head - painless, palpable gallbladder with mild jaundice is suggestive of malignancy (according to courvoisier's law)
• Body and tail - may remain asymptomatic until later stages as they do not impinge on the biliary tract and do not cause jaundice
other common pathological features of this condition are:
• Desmoplastic reaction - growth of fibrous or connective tissue
• perineural invasion, as well as lymphatic and large vessel invasion",,B,
Q12,stellate granuloma is seen in :,"a)sarcoidosis
b)cat-scratch disease
c)cryptococcosis
d)Histoplasmosis","stellate granuloma is seen in cat-scratch disease. It is also known as subacute regional

Regional lymph nodes demonstrate:
• Follicular hyperplasia with circumscribed central stellate necrosis with neutrophils
• surrounded by palisading histiocytes (suppurative granulomas)
• sinuses packed with monocytoid B cells
• usually, there are no perifollicular and intrafollicular epithelioid cells",,B,1942-1217.PNG;1942-1216.PNG

Q14,The most consistent and persistent feature of bladder carcinoma is:,"a)painless hematuria
b)painful hematuria
c)Dysuria
d)suprapubic mass","The most consistent and persistent feature of carcinoma bladder is painless hematuria.
Bladder tumors produce a wide range of clinical features including:
• painless hematuria - classical feature and may be the only clinical manifestation
• Irritative urinary symptoms (frequency, urgency, dysuria) - diffuse tumors or tumors at the bladder neck
• pyelonephritis or hydronephrosis - when the ureteral orifice is involved
• obstructive symptoms, palpable suprapubic mass, or lower extremity edema - late presentation with a large tumor mass
• weight loss and/or localized bone pain - metastatic disease",,A,
Q15,Fever occurs during inflammation due to all except:,"a)IL 1
b)prostaglandins
c)TNF
d)Histamine","Histamine is involved in the mediation of vascular events of inflammation, not fever.
Fever is characterized by an elevation of body temperature, usually by 1° to 4°c. It is one of the most prominent manifestations of the acute-phase response, especially if associated with
infection.
Substances that induce fever are called pyrogens. They may be exogenous or endogenous.
• Endogenous pyrogens - IL-1, TNF, prostaglandins
• Exogenous pyrogens -
• Lipopolysaccharides of bacterial walls
• They stimulate leukocytes to release endogenous pyrogens (IL-1 and TNF)
cytokines result in an increase in cyclooxygenases that convert arachidonic acid into
prostaglandins. These prostaglandins are produced in the vascular and perivascular cells of the



hypothalamus. In the hypothalamus, they stimulate the production of neurotransmitters that reset the temperature setpoint to a higher level. This is especially by PGE2.",,D,
Q16,Anaplasia refers to:,"a)Lack of differentiation
b)variation in cell size and shape
c)Replacement of one type of cell by other
d)Disordered arrangement of tumor cells","Anaplasia refers to a lack of differentiation.
The term anaplasia means to form backward implying a reversal of differentiation to a more
primitive level. The extent to which neoplastic cells resemble normal cells, both morphologically and functionally, is called differentiation.
Anaplasia is an important morphological feature of malignant transformation.
The morphological features of malignancy include:
• Anaplasia
• Pleomorphism - variation in the size and shape of cells
• Increased N: C ratio (nucleus: cytoplasmic ratio) - around 1:4 in normal cells, increases to 1:1 in malignant cells
• Hyperchromasia - coarsely clumped and darkly stained chromatin within irregular nuclei
• Increased mitosis - atypical, bizarre mitotic figures
• Loss of polarity - sheets or large masses of tumor cells grow in an anarchic, disorganized fashion",,A,
Q17,which of the following is an opsonin?,"a)C3a
b)C3b
c)C5a
d)C6","C3b functions as an opsonin.
opsonization is the process of coating a foreign particle and preparing it for phagocytosis. The substances involved in this process are called opsonins and include:
• Mannose-binding lectin
• C3b, C4b, C5b
• IgM and Fc receptor of IgG
• CRP
• Fibrinogen
Elie Metchnikoff was the first person to describe the process of phagocytosis, and is hence known as the Father of Innate Immunity.",,B,
Q18,CD-59 is involved in ____________.,"a)paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
b)chediak-Higashi syndrome
c)Essential thrombocythemia
d)primary myelofibrosis","CD-59 is involved in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).



Factors regulating complementary pathways:
• DAF or CD-55 inhibits C3 activation
• MIRL or CD-59 inhibits the membrane-activating complex
In PNH, DAF and MIRL are absent. Hence, there will be unregulated complement activation.
Clinical features of PNH include:
• Intravascular hemoglobinuria - cola-colored urine
• Pancytopenia + hypercellular bone marrow
• Thrombosis (if hepatic vein involved → Budd–Chiari syndrome)
Diagnosis of PNH is by the following methods:
• HAM’s test - acidified serum lysis
• sucrose lysis test
• Flow cytometry - absence of CD 55 and CD 59 on RBC
Eculizumab is used to alleviate the hemolysis associated with PNH and its sequelae. Eculizumab does not alter the underlying defect of the disease.
Note: FDA has recently approved Pegcetacoplan for adults with PNH which acts by binding to complement protein C3 and increasing hemoglobin concentration.",,A,
Q19,Leiden mutation is of factor:,"a)V
b)VIII
c)I
d)X","Leiden mutation is a single nucleotide mutation that occurs in factor V. This is named after the city in The Netherlands where it was discovered.
of the inherited causes of hypercoagulability, point mutations in the factor V gene and
prothrombin gene are the most common.",,A,
Q20,which of the following is the most important determinant of malignant potential in the papillary type of renal tumor?,"a)Immnunohistology
b)size
c)cytogenetics
d)part of kidney involved","The most important determinant of malignant potential in the papillary type of renal tumor is the size of the tumor.
The papillary type of renal tumors includes:
• Renal papillary adenoma (≤ 1.5 cm)
• Papillary type of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) - &gt; 1.5 cm
small renal papillary growths are fairly common and incidentally found. Ruling out of malignancy is one of the processes carried out during the evaluation of donor transplant kidneys.





papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the second most common type of renal cell carcinoma and it arises from proximal tubules. It can be multifocal or bilateral. It is typically hemorrhagic and
cystic, especially when large.
It is often a circumscribed tumor composed of papillae formed by delicate fibrovascular cores that often contain foamy macrophages and psammoma bodies.
It has two histological types:
• Type 1 papillary RCC - single layer of cells on the basement membrane and low-grade nuclear features
• Type 2 papillary RCC - pseudostratification of cells and usually has high-grade nuclear features",,B,1946-1218.PNG
