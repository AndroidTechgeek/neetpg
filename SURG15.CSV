Q1,A male presented with discharge as shown in the image. what is the diagnosis?,"a)Fistula in ano
b)Fissure in ano
c)External Haemorrhoids
d)pilonidal sinus","The diagnosis, considering the purulent discharge shown in the image, is a fistula in ano.
A fistula-in-ano is an abnormal hollow tract or cavity that is lined with granulation tissue and that connects a primary opening inside the anal canal to a secondary opening in the perianal skin. The most common cause is a perianal abscess. other causes include tuberculosis or crohn's disease.
symptoms:
• perianal pain
• Discharge- intermittent purulent discharge (which may be bloody)
Goodsall’s rule can be used as a guide in determining the location of the internal opening of the fistula.
• Fistulas with an external opening anteriorly connect to the internal opening by a short, radial tract.
• Fistulas with an external opening posteriorly track in a curvilinear fashion to the posterior midline.





Exceptions to Goodsall’s Rule
However, exceptions to this rule often occur: Fistulas with an anterior external opening greater than 3 cm from the anal margin usually track to the posterior midline.
Investigations:
The investigations done for fistula-in-ano are as follows:
• Fistulogram
• Endoanal ultrasound
• MRI
• computed tomography (cT) scan
• Endocoil MRI
• Hydrogen peroxide–enhanced 3-D endoanal ultrasonography
MRI is the gold standard investigation for fistula imaging. It helps us to identify the secondary extensions of the track, which when missed may cause persistence of the fistula.
Treatment:
• control of constipation
• sitz bath
• Fistulotomy
• Fistulectomy
• Ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT)
• setons
• Advancement flaps other options:



option B: A fissure in ano is a linear ulcer usually found in the midline, distal to the dentate line. It is one of the most common causes of anal pain and bleeding. They typically start with a tear in the anoderm within the distal half of the anal canal which then triggers cycles of recurring anal     pain and bleeding, which lead to the development of a chronic anal fissure. The exposed internal  sphincter muscle within the bed of the fissure frequently spasms, which not only contributes to    severe pain but also can restrict blood flow to the fissure, preventing its healing.
option C: Hemorrhoids are cushions of submucosal tissue containing venules, arterioles, and
smooth muscle fibers located in the anal canal. External hemorrhoids are distal to the dentate line and are covered with anoderm; these may engorge, causing pain. Thrombosis of these external
hemorrhoids causes severe pain.
option D: Pilonidal sinus disease is commonly seen in the natal cleft, more in men, usually after puberty. Drivers and hairdressers are more commonly affected. The pilonidal sinus opening is
usually seen in the midline between the sacrococcygeal joint's level and the coccyx's tip. The other sites that can be affected include the interdigital cleft and axilla.",5146-3204.PNG,A,5172-3238.PNG
Q2,A man presented to the emergency department after RTA with complaints of chest pain and   breathing difficulty. An X-ray was done and is given below. what type of breathing pattern is observed in this patient?,"a)cheyne stokes
b)paradoxical
c)Biot
d)kussmaul","The type of breathing pattern observed in this patient with the X-ray showing contiguous rib fractures on the right side suggestive of a flail chest is paradoxical respiration.
A flail chest usually results from blunt trauma associated with 3 or more rib fractures in 2 or more places. It arises when these injuries cause a part of the chest wall to move independently of the
rest of the chest wall. It is diagnosed clinically by observing paradoxical respiration. on
inspiration, the loose segment of the chest wall gets displaced inwards, and on expiration, it
moves outwards. They are at higher risk of developing pneumothorax/hemothorax. CT scan is the gold standard investigation.
Management includes oxygen administration, adequate analgesia (including opiates) or epidural analgesia, and physiotherapy. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) is reserved for      patients developing respiratory failure despite adequate analgesia and oxygen

Q3,"A mother brought her 3-month-old male child to the hospital, who is currently unable to pass urine. A similar issue was reported 15 days ago. The catheter could be passed without
difficulty. The image of the micturating cystourethrogram is given below. what is the most appropriate management for this condition?","a)partial resection of verumontanum
b)Endoscopic dilation of bladder neck
c)Indwelling catheter
d)Destruction of valves","The given image of a micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) shows dilated prostatic urethra and transverse filling defects corresponding with the posterior urethral valves and the most
appropriate management for this condition is destruction of valves.
posterior urethral valves are the most common cause of severe obstructive uropathy in
children. The pathological valves are membranes that have a small posterior slit within them,
which typically lie just distal to the verumontanum. They act as flap valves and are obstructive to antegrade urinary flow.



Diagnosis is most commonly made antenatally with ultrasound, which demonstrates bilateral    hydronephrosis above a distended bladder in fetus along with oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia.
If the diagnosis is not made antenatally, then babies typically present with urinary infections in the neonatal period or with uremia and renal failure. Clinically a poor urinary stream,
dribbling, and palpable bladder (due to diverticula) can be present. The investigation of choice is micturating cystourethrography.
The initial step in treatment is to insert a urinary catheter to drain the urine and decompress the bladder and upper urinary tracts. A small polyethene feeding tube (No. 5 or No. 8 French) is
inserted into the bladder, which can be difficult because the tube's tip can coil in the prostatic urethra. A Foley catheter should not be used because the balloon can cause severe bladder
spasms, which can result in severe ureteral obstruction.
Endoscopic valve ablation and symptomatic management of urinary tract infections are the definitive treatments.
The below image shows the micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) with dilated prostatic urethra and transverse filling defects (constriction) corresponding with the posterior urethral valves.


The ultrasound shows the typical 'key-hole' sign in which the bladder and the proximal urethra are dilated.",5147-3205.PNG,D,5175-3241.PNG;5176-3242.PNG
Q4,what is the condition seen here?,"a)Gastric ulcers
b)oesophageal varices
c)candidiasis
d)Barret's esophagus","The given endoscopic image of a patient suggests esophageal varices.
Esophageal varices are tortuous dilated veins within the mucosa and submucosa of the distal esophagus and proximal stomach. variceal hemorrhage is an emergency that can be treated
medically by inducing splanchnic vasoconstriction or endoscopically by sclerotherapy, balloon tamponade, or variceal ligation.
other options:
option A: Gastric ulcers are often found near the lesser curvature of the stomach, especially in the antral area. Although duodenal ulcers are more common overall, gastric ulcers are frequently
located near the lesser curvature, within a few centimetres of the pylorus. A significant cause of these ulcers is infection with Helicobacter pylori.
The following is an endoscopic image of Gastric ulcer:





option C: Esophageal candidiasis is a fungal infection of the esophagus caused by the overgrowth of yeast, commonly Candida albicans. This condition is often seen in individuals with weakened    immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, diabetes, or those undergoing
immunosuppressive treatments.
The following is an endoscopic image of esophageal candidiasis:


option D: Barrett's esophagus is a type of metaplasia at the gastro-esophagal junction due to
chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The squamous esophageal mucosa is converted to a columnal/intestinal type that is better suited to handle acid reflux. It is associated with an     increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
The following shows an endoscopic image of Barrett's esophagus:",5148-3207.PNG,B,5177-3244.PNG;5177-3243.PNG;5178-3245.PNG
Q5,The baby was born with this deformity. what is the earliest age to correct this defect?,"a)3 months
b)1 year
c)6 months
d)18 months","The earliest age to correct this defect in a child with bilateral cleft lip and palate is 6 months.
cleft lip repair is done between 3-6 months of age and palate repair is done between 6-12 months of age. As this child's deformity needs to be corrected by palatal repair, the best answer in this
scenario is 6 months.
A cleft lip is due to the failure of the fusion of maxillary prominence with medial nasal
prominence. It can be unilateral or bilateral. It can vary in severity from a small notch in the
upper lip to a double cleft extending into both nostrils. There is also associated underdevelopment of the part of the maxilla that bears the incisors. Millard cleft lip repair is done by rotating the
local nasolabial flaps. cleft lip repair is preferably done between 3-6 months of age.
A cleft palate can occur in the primary palate (anterior cleft) or the secondary palate (posterior  palate). A complete cleft palate involves both the primary and secondary palate. An incomplete cleft palate involves only the secondary palate.
In the bilateral complete cleft palate, a Y-shaped cleft is seen with gaps between the primary and secondary palate and between the two halves of the secondary palate. In addition, there is a
bilateral cleft upper lip.
The different types of facial clefts are shown below:





• unilateral cleft lip with alveolar involvement
• Bilateral cleft lip with alveolar involvement
• unilateral cleft lip associated with cleft palate
• Bilateral cleft lip and palate
• cleft palate only
Note: palate repair is done between 6-12 months of age. The palatal repair is done maintaining the balance between speech outcomes and mid-facial growth. The generally agreed timeline is before   speech development. However, the exact timeline is still debated and no uniform consensus is
available.",5149-3209.PNG,C,5179-3246.PNG
Q6,"A patient with a history of tuberculosis presents with dysuria and sterile pyuria. The
cystoscopy image of the patient is provided below. Based on the patient’s history and the cystoscopic findings, which of the following conditions is most likely associated?","a)Linear ulcer of the bladder
b)Golf hole ureter
c)ureterocele
d)urethral stricture","The cystoscopic findings are suggestive of  a ""golf hole ureter"", which is most likely associated with genitourinary tuberculosis(TB).
Genitourinary TB is caused by the dissemination of the organism through the bloodstream and is thus always a secondary TB. There is either reinfection or reactivation of old TB. It can affect the  kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymis, and vas deferens.
Lesions caused by tuberculosis in the kidney include:
• Golf hole ureteric orifice - This is due to fibrosis causing the rigid withdrawn dilated ureteric orifice to look like a golf hole (cystoscopic finding).
• papillary ulcer - earliest lesion
• pyonephrosis - caused by multiple scattered papillary ulcers undergoing caseous necrosis, which later become filled with pus
• perinephric abscess -  by extension of pyonephrosis or tuberculous renal abscess



• pseudocalculi - occurs when calcium gets deposited in a papillary ulcer healed with fibrosis
• Ghost calyces - caused by the destruction of the calyces
• Thimble bladder -the entire urinary bladder gets fibrosed, stiff, and unable to dilate and accommodate urine (IV urogram finding).
• putty/cement kidney - amorphous dystrophic calcification eventually involves the entire kidney (seen in X-ray and CT)
The following X-ray KUB shows a thimble bladder:


Ureteric lesions can also be seen in genitourinary tuberculosis. They include:
• Kerr’s kink - kinking of the ureteropelvic junction (UpJ)
• Ureteral stricture
• Beaded ureter
• shortening of the ureter
• Golf hole ureter - Longitudinal fibrosis leads to the shortening of the ureter and pulling up the orifice as a gaping hole. Reimplantation of ureter is done.",5149-3208.PNG,B,5180-3247.PNG;5181-3248.PNG
Q7,what instrument is required for the following procedure?,"a)ureteroscope
b)cystourethroscope
c)Nephroscope
d)ultrasound guided scope","The instrument required for placing the Double J stent (DJ stent), as shown in the radiograph is a cystourethroscope.
Cystourethroscopy allows for the examination and access of the bladder and urethra, which is
crucial for guiding the DJ stent from the bladder into the ureter. This procedure involves inserting a flexible or rigid endoscope through the urethra and into the bladder, where the stent can be
manoeuvred into the ureter.
while ureteroscopy is typically used to visualize and treat issues directly within the ureter,
cystourethroscopy provides the necessary access and visualization to position the DJ stent
correctly. This approach is effective for ensuring the stent is placed accurately, particularly in cases where access to the bladder is essential.
other options:
option A: A ureteroscope is used to examine and treat the ureters (the tubes connecting the
kidneys to the bladder). It is commonly used for removing kidney stones or evaluating issues in the ureter.
option C: A nephroscope is a type of scope used to examine the kidneys directly. It is often used in procedures like percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) to remove large kidney stones.
option D: An ultrasound-guided scope refers to an endoscope or medical device used in
conjunction with ultrasound imaging to guide procedures. It’s often used in various parts of the body, including the gallbladder, liver, or kidney to help visualize structures during minimally
invasive surgeries or biopsies.",5150-3210.PNG,B,
Q8,"A patient with a history of umbilical swelling, initially asymptomatic for many years, now complains of pain over the swelling. The swelling was reducible initially but is now
non-reducible. what is the appropriate management?","a)umbilectomy with herniorrhaphy
b)umbilectomy
c)conservative management with antibiotics
d)Incision and drainage","The appropriate management for this patient with a diagnosis of umbilical hernia with painful, non-reducible swelling is umbilectomy with umbilical herniorrhaphy.
An umbilical hernia occurs when a defect in the umbilical or median raphe area allows abdominal
contents to protrude. In adults, these hernias often present as a swelling near the umbilicus that
can become painful and non-reducible over time. conditions that cause stretching and thinning of the midline raphe, such as obesity, pregnancy, or liver cirrhosis with ascites, increase the risk of     such complications.
The management of painful, non-reducible umbilical hernia typically involves surgical
intervention due to the risk of strangulation and bowel obstruction. Umbilical herniorrhaphy with umbilectomy is the standard approach, addressing both the hernia and the associated defect.
In children, the umbilical defect is usually present at birth and typically closes as the umbilical cord stump heals within the first week. If this closure process is delayed, it can result in
herniation during the neonatal period. Additionally, in adults, the umbilical ring can stretch and reopen, leading to similar herniation.",5151-3212.PNG,A,
Q9,A baby was brought in with complaints of intermittent feculent discharge from the umbilicus. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)umbilical polyp
b)Ileal diverticulum
c)urachus
d)urachal cyst","The presence of feculent discharge at the umbilicus with the persistence of the vitellointestinal duct is suggestive of vitelline fistula which occurs due to an ileal diverticulum.
The given clinical image is that of a congenital umbilical anomaly such as patent urachus, urachal cyst, and vitelline cyst (resulting from the persistence of omphalomesenteric duct). The next best   step is the USG abdomen to diagnose if the anomaly is cystic, fibrous or fistula and its
connections.
vitello intestinal duct or omphalomesenteric duct is the connection between the yolk sac and the midgut during embryonic life, which eventually gets obliterated. The persistence of the
vitellointestinal duct leads to various abnormalities depending on which part of the duct remains patent.
• persistence of the proximal intestinal end of the duct leads to the Ileal diverticula/Meckel’s diverticula.
• persistence of the distal end near the umbilicus leads to the umbilical polyp or sinus.
• persistence of the distal end with mucus retention leads to the cyst, which may be associated with the intestine or the umbilicus by a fibrous band.
• A fully patent vitellointestinal duct can lead to an enterocutaneous fistula.





patent urachus occurs due to the failure of urachus to obliterate, resulting in a connection between the bladder and the umbilicus.
urachal cyst occurs when the urachus fails to obliterate but there is no connection between the bladder and the umbilicus.
The image below shows a urachal cyst (uc) attached to Meckel’s diverticulum (MD) on one side and a urinary bladder (uB) on the other side with a patent tract- urachus (u).",5151-3211.PNG,B,5185-3249-1.png;5185-3249-2.png
Q10,"A patient presents with renal colic and recurrent urinary tract infections. A CT scan reveals     no significant findings. The patient undergoes a percutaneous nephrolithotomy and his urine analysis is as shown. Based on the clinical presentation and the urine analysis findings, what  are these crystals made up of?","a)struvite
b)oxalate
c)uric acid
d)Cystine","The image shows a hexagonal crystal, suggesting cystine stones. These stones are a recurrent feature in patients with cystinuria.



Cystinuria is the most common inborn error of amino acid transport. It occurs due to defective    basic amino acid transporter in the proximal tubules of the kidney. This leads to the excretion of cystine(dimer of cysteine), ornithine, lysine and arginine, abbreviated as CoLA.
The disease manifests as precipitation of cystine stones in the urine leading to renal colic. oral hydration is the mainstay of treatment.
Crystals in urine are usually associated with kidney stones. Crystals form in the urine depending upon a variety of factors including:
• The degree of concentration of constituent molecules
• The urine pH
• The presence of inhibitors of crystallisation
Calcium oxalate and uric acid crystals can sometimes be found in normal urine that has been left to stand, due to crystal formation ex vivo.",5152-3213.PNG,D,
Q11,what is the treatment plan for this condition?,"a)Full thickness skin grafting
b)split thickness skin grafting
c)vaccum-assisted closure
d)Flap","The given clinical image is suggestive of partial thickness burns and the treatment plan for this condition is split thickness skin grafting.
split-thickness skin graft (Thiersch graft ): partial-thickness skin grafts consisting of the epidermis and a portion of the dermis are called split-thickness skin grafts. Less dermis in the split-thickness skin graft translates into less primary contraction (the degree to which a graft shrinks in surface     area after harvesting and before grafting) and more secondary contraction (the degree to which a   graft shrinks during healing). Humby knife is used to harvest split-thickness skin grafts.
Advantages of split skin graft over full-thickness skin graft:
• Large grafts can be harvested.
• In the case of thinner split-thickness grafts, the donor site heals more rapidly and can be reused in severe cases such
as burns.
• uptake is good.
• Meshing can be done, i.e., small splits are made in graft and any exudates collected can come out through this, improving graft takeup. It also allows the graft to expand.
other options
option A: Full-thickness skin grafts (wolfe graft) include the epidermis and entire dermis, with portions of the sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and hair follicles. More dermis in the
full-thickness skin graft translates into more primary contraction and less secondary contraction.
option C: VAC is a negative pressure dressing. An occlusive dressing is placed over the sore and it is connected to VAC that generates -125mmHg of pressure. It is used in chronic non-healing
ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, burn wounds, and bed sores.
Venous ulcers are due to chronic venous insufficiency and are particularly seen in the lower ■ of the leg above the ankle on the medial aspect, known as the gaiter zone. Ambulatory venous



hypertension is the most acceptable theory in the pathophysiology of venous ulcers. Venous ulcers have a sloping edge and the floor contains granulation tissue covered by slough and exudate.
Marjolin’s ulcer is a type of squamous cell carcinoma seen in chronic long-standing venous ulcers.


option D: Flaps are tissues with a blood supply, providing vascularity to a new area. Types include:
• Random Flaps: Rectangular, with no specific blood supply, length-to-breadth ratio ≤ 1.5:1.
• Axial Flaps: Long flaps based on known blood vessels, suitable for large distances.
• Pedicled/Isolated Flaps: Axial supply allows them to be moved on a stalk or fully isolated.
• Free Flaps: Blood supply disconnected and reconnected via microsurgery.
• composite Flaps: combine tissues like skin with bone or muscle.
• Perforator Flaps: use small vessels from major blood vessels to supply the surface.",5153-3215.PNG,B,5185-3249.PNG
Q12,"A patient with oral cancer underwent radical surgery and PMMC flap reconstruction as
shown. what is the most important indicator for considering adjuvant radiotherapy in this patient?","a)Close margin &lt; 5 mm
b)Extra nodal extension
c)Multiple lymph nodes
d)perineural invasion","The most important indicator for considering adjuvant radiotherapy in this patient is extranodal extension (ENE).
For patients with oral cavity cancer, ENE is a key indicator for adjuvant radiotherapy. Adjuvant  therapy, typically involving external beam radiotherapy, is recommended based on pathological  features such as ENE, close margins (1–4.9 mm), or involved margins (≤ 1 mm), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and perineural invasion (PNI).
The presence of one major criterion - ENE or margins ≤1 mm or two minor criteria - close margins (1–4.9 mm), multiple involved nodes, largest node &gt;3cm, LVI/PNI or T3/4, guides the decision   for additional treatment.
Major criteria
• Extranodal invasion



• Lymphovascular invasion
• perineural invasion
• T3/T4
Minor criteria
• Close margins (1–4.9 mm)
• Multiple involved nodes
• Largest node &gt;3cm
Landmark trials have demonstrated that high-dose cisplatin added to radiotherapy enhances outcomes in high-risk patients, particularly those with ENE and positive margins.
Note: The pMMC flap is the most commonly used flap for soft tissue reconstruction in head and    neck surgery. The pectoralis flap can be harvested as a musculocutaneous flap or muscle-only flap and is based on the pectoral branch of the thoracoacromial artery. Following flap harvest, a
subcutaneous tunnel is created from the donor site, over the clavicles, to the defect. Division of the pectoral nerve branches ensures atrophy of the muscle to reduce the bulge over the clavicle over time.",5153-3214.PNG,B,
Q13,Identify the stage of bed sore in the sacral region.,"a)stage 1
b)stage 2
c)stage 3
d)stage 4","The given image shows a pressure sore with extensive tissue destruction, including damage to the muscle layer and thus it belongs to stage 4.
pressure sores also known as bed sores, pressure ulcers and decubitus ulcers are ulcers that occur  due to prolonged pressure on certain sites thereby leading to tissue necrosis. The commonest sites involved are ischium, greater trochanter, sacrum, heel, malleolus (lateral &gt;medial), and occiput.
paraplegic patients, elderly patients, and severely ill patients are at a higher risk of developing pressure sores.
Management is primarily proper skin care with pressure dispersion cushions, air-fluidized beds,   and urinary or fecal diversion if required. patients who are bed-bound should be turned once in 2 hours. Those in a wheelchair should lift themselves off the seat for 1o seconds every 1o minutes.
surgery is the last resort and is done after a proper initial debridement and vacuum-assisted closure. vacuum-assisted closure is a wound closure technique in which negative pressure is applied to the wound which leads to a decrease in edema. This hastens the debridement and formation of granulation tissue. skin flaps with a muscle are also used for closure.",5154-3216.PNG,D,
Q14,"Based on the constituents, identify the fluid given to post-operative patients.","a)Haemaccel
b)Ringer lactate
c)Isolyte P
d)Isolyte M","The fluid shown in the image is ringer lactate or Hartmann's solution.
Ringer lactate, or Hartmann's solution, is a crystalloid made up of sodium 131 mEq, chloride 112 mEq, potassium 5 mEq, bicarbonate (as lactate) 29 mEq, and 2 mEq of calcium. It is devoid of    glucose.



It is useful in the following conditions:
• Correction of severe hypovolemia
• Metabolic acidosis
• postoperative period, burns, diarrhoea
• Correction of hypokalemia
• Diabetic ketoacidosis.
It should be avoided in severe shock, liver diseases, vomiting, nasogastric aspiration, and
metabolic alkalosis. It cannot be used along with blood transfusion since calcium in the ringer lactate can bind with citrate in the transfused blood leading to clot formation.
other options:
option A: Haemaccel is a colloid and contains 145 mmol of sodium, 6.25 mmol of calcium, and 5.1 mmol of potassium. It is mainly used for rapid volume replacement in circulatory shock, burns,
and trauma. These release histamine and hence, an H2 blocker has to be supplemented. It is also used in heart-lung machines.
options C: Isolyte p is a crystalloid. Isolyte p is commonly used in fluid therapy for paediatrics. one litre contains 5o grams of glucose, 25 mEq of sodium, 22 mEq of potassium, 3 mEq of
magnesium, and 23 mEq of acetate. Hyponatremia, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and hypovolemic shock are some of the contraindications.
option D: Isolyte M is a crystalloid. Isolyte M is used as a maintenance fluid. It mainly contains 5o grams of glucose, 4o mEq sodium, 38 mEq chloride, 35 mEq potassium, 15 mEq phosphate, and 2o mEq acetate. It is useful in correcting hypokalemia in patients with good renal function, and acidosis. It is contraindicated in hyponatremia.",5155-3218.PNG,B,
Q15,"A female patient presented with a breast mass, as shown in the image below, with
concomitant liver metastasis. what is the recommended management plan for this patient?","a)simple mastectomy
b)Neo adjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery
c)Modified radical mastectomy
d)Radical mastectomy","The image of a large breast mass with an unevenly bosselated surface, overlying skin ulceration, and concomitant liver metastasis is indicative of a malignant phyllodes tumor which is managed by simple mastectomy.
phyllodes tumors spread primarily through the bloodstream (hematogenous). Lymph node
metastases are uncommon. Large or malignant phyllodes tumors may require a simple
mastectomy, but axillary dissection is not recommended (option C and D) due to the rare
involvement of axillary lymph nodes. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy (option B) in malignant phyllodes tumors remains uncertain and is generally not recommended as a standard treatment.
phyllodes tumor also known as a sero-cystic disease of Brodie or cystosarcoma phyllodes,
originates from hormonally responsive stromal cells of the breast. It is usually a benign condition and affects women &gt; 4o years of age, but can be seen in younger women. sometimes, may
develop malignant transformation.
The clinical features include large, sometimes massive, with an unevenly bosselated surface,  ulceration of overlying skin occurs because of pressure necrosis and it remains mobile on the chest wall.



There is no role of FNAC in phyllodes tumor. Histopathology of the lump biopsy shows increased stromal cellularity, overgrowth, and typical leaflike architecture. Tumors are treated by excision    with margins of at least 2 cm to prevent local recurrence.",5155-3217.PNG,A,
Q16,"An elderly male who presented with the following lesion as shown, is diagnosed with stage T3 carcinoma with no clinically palpable inguinal lymph nodes. what is the management
strategy for this patient?","a)penectomy alone
b)penectomy + orchidectomy
c)penectomy + Inguinal lymph node dissection
d)penectomy + superficial inguinal lymph node dissection","The most appropriate management for this patient with stage T3 carcinoma of the penis with no clinically palpable inguinal lymph nodes is penectomy with superficial inguinal lymph node
dissection.
In penile carcinoma, total amputation of the penis is done if the stump is &lt; 2cm after resection of the tumour and partial penectomy is done if the stump is &gt;2cm. Carcinoma of the penis is    commonly a squamous cell carcinoma. It arises from the skin of the glans penis or the prepuce.    The lesion can be flat or warty in appearance.
• T1- confined to the skin
• T2- invades the corpus spongiosum or cavernosum.
• T3- invades the urethra
• T4- invades adjacent structures.
The first lymph node to be involved is the superficial inguinal lymph node and thus, superficial   inguinal lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) helps evaluate the spread of penile cancer.
Tumours oflow-grade and low-stage are managed by Mohs’ surgery. Tumors involving the glans penis require glansectomy, and in advanced cases require partial penectomy.",5034-3153.PNG,D,5047-3163.PNG
Q17,The most commonly occurring complication ofTpN in a sepsis patient in ICU:,"a)Hyperlipidemia
b)Hypertriglyceridemia
c)Reactive Hypoglycemia
d)Hyperglycemia","The most commonly occurring complication ofTPN in a sepsis patient in the ICU is
hyperglycemia.
To monitor or prevent complications in patients on TPN, the following steps may be taken:
• Infections
• Monitor the development of glucose intolerance as it is the earliest sign of systemic sepsis. (Note: glucose intolerance- glucose not processed effectively, leading to hyperglycemia)
• Use subclavian vein preferably
• Metabolic complications
• BUN and LFTs weekly
• serum electrolytes every 2-3 days
• Intestinal atrophy
• Provide at least some nutrients enterally if feasible
TPN also referred to as central parenteral nutrition is used for patients who can't absorb nutrients through their digestive tract, often due to conditions like short bowel syndrome from extensive
intestinal resection or fistulas. It can also be temporary until other feeding methods, like a nasojejunal tube, are established.
TPN typically comes in a 3-liter bag with a lipid emulsion, amino acids, glucose, electrolytes, and vitamins. The energy provided is about 15o–25o kcal per gram of protein nitrogen, with 3o–5o% from fat. Folic acid is added weekly, with other vitamins given daily, and long-term TPN may
require vitamin B12 supplementation.",,D,
Q18,A CT scan of a patient with a hydatid cyst is shown below. what is the type of hydatid cyst as per the Gharbi classification?,"a)Type 4
b)Type 3
c)Type 2
d)Type 1","The given CT scan showing the hydatid cyst with detached membranes(Water Lily sign)
is classified as CE-3 according to the WHO classification and Type 2 according to the Gharbi classification.






Hydatid Cyst is a zoonotic infection caused by the Echinococcus species(dog tapeworm ). Dogs are the definitive hosts of E. granulosus. sheep are the usual intermediate hosts, but humans are
accidental intermediate hosts. Humans are end-stage hosts of the parasite since there is no human-to-human transmission.
The clinical presentation of a hydatid cyst is largely asymptomatic until complications occur. The most common presenting symptoms are abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and vomiting. The most
frequent sign is hepatomegaly.
Approximately 75% of hydatid cysts are located in the right lobe of the liver and are solitary.
CT scan is the best imaging modality for hydatid cysts. It shows the presence of a space-occupying lesion with a smooth outline with septa. Diagnosis is suggested by the finding of a multiloculated   cyst on ultrasound and is further supported by the finding of a floating membrane within the cysts on a CT scan. Active cysts contain a large number of smaller daughter cysts (multi-vesicular
rosette-like cystic lesions with daughter cysts) which is characteristic of hydatid cysts of the liver.


If there is a disruption of the inner layers of the cyst, the following signs may be noted:
• water lily sign/ camalote sign - air-fluid level with a floating membrane (as shown below)
• Rising sun sign/ serpent sign - a double-wall, dry cyst with crumpled membranes lying at its bottom
• Empty cyst sign - when all the contents are removed





The ultrasound of an active hydatid cyst shows multiple septations and a rosette or honeycomb appearance (as shown below)


The serpent sign is seen as wavy membranes within the cyst, on CT imaging.

Q19,Identify the image:,"a)Ileal diverticulum
b)Bladder exstrophy
c)omphalocele
d)Gastroschisis","The given image showing a midline defect situated in the lower abdominal region below the umbilicus with an exposed bladder is suggestive of ectopia vesicae/ bladder exstrophy.
Ectopia vesicae/ bladder exstrophy is a congenital abdominal wall defect wherein the bladder
protrudes from the lower abdominal wall and its mucosa is exposed. This results in the separation of the pubic rami and the rectus muscles.
The condition can be associated with complete epispadias with dorsal chordee, undescended
testes, and inguinal hernias in males. Females may also have epispadias and separation of the two halves of the clitoris (bifid clitoris). The condition can be associated with rectal prolapse and short stature in both sexes.
untreated exstrophy can cause urinary incontinence and is associated with an increased incidence of bladder cancer. Management involves a staged surgical reconstruction of the bladder and
genitalia.
other options:
option A: The primitive gut is connected to the definitive yolk sac through a narrow stalk-like
communication known as the vitellointestinal duct. In about 2% of the population, a small section of the vitellointestinal duct persists to form an outpouching of the ileum called the Meckel
diverticulum or ileal diverticulum.
option C: Gastroschisis is a condition where the intestinal loops herniate through the defect in the abdominal wall. The defect usually lies on one side of the umbilicus (Right side commonly). The     loops of the bowel are not covered by amnion. It is associated with elevated alpha-fetoprotein
levels.
option D: omphalocele is another congenital midline abdominal wall defect at the umbilicus
causing herniation of the abdominal contents into the base of the umbilical cord. The herniated viscera is covered with peritoneum without any overlying skin. This condition can be associated



with Beckwith-wiedemann syndrome which is associated with embryonal tumors such as wilms tumor.",5158-3221.PNG,B,
Q20,Identify the following:,"a)Fluoroscopy
b)X-ray of alkali ingestion
c)Barium swallow
d)X-ray of acid ingestion","The given image shows a barium swallow. It is a type of imaging where the patient ingests barium, a contrast agent, to visualize the esophagus and detect abnormalities. The described indentations   in the esophageal lumen caused by anterior osteophytes (bony outgrowths) are characteristic
findings that can be seen with a barium swallow.
Fluoroscopy (option A) is a technique that provides real-time X-ray images and is often used
during procedures like a barium swallow, but the term is more general. X-ray of alkali ingestion    (option B) and X-ray of acid ingestion (option D) might show damage to the esophagus in barium swallow which is not seen in the image.",5158-3220.PNG,C,
Q21,Identify pseudomembranous colitis from the given image.,"a)3
b)4
c)1
d)2","The image 3 given above shows yellow plaques and nodules on the mucosa are suggestive of pseudomembranous colitis. It is usually caused by clostridium difficile. The pathogenesis is  mediated by the enterotoxins - toxin A and toxin B.
clostridium difficile is a gram-positive anaerobic bacillus that causes clostridioides
(formerly clostridium) difficile infection after ingestion of spores of the organism. The more
severe form of the condition is known as pseudomembranous colitis (PMc). Enzyme
immunoassay to detect glutamate dehydrogenase is less specific compared to toxin detection for diagnosis. So a combination of the two can be used for diagnostic confirmation.
The condition is most commonly associated with prolonged antimicrobial use, which interferes with the commensal colonic microflora. The most commonly implicated antibiotics
are cephalosporins, ampicillin, and clindamycin. The spores are spread by contact with
the feces of affected individuals or asymptomatic carriers. It can persist on surfaces for months. Risk factors include poor hand hygiene, old age, and gastrointestinal surgery.
The spores germinate in the small intestine and produce two toxins—toxin A (enterotoxin)
and toxin B (cytotoxin). These interfere with the epithelial-cell barrier function and result in
diarrhea and pseudomembrane formation. The pseudomembranes appear as small whitish-yellow plaques initially which later coalesce to involve the entire colon wall. It contains necrotic
leukocytes, fibrin, and cellular debris. The anamnestic IgG response determines which patients develop the disease or remain asymptomatic.
Symptoms include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical criteria and detection of toxin or the organism in stool samples. This can be done
by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PcR) or by culture.
Discontinuation of any ongoing antimicrobials and adequate hydration are general measures that  are recommended. oral fidaxomicin or vancomycin is the first-line treatment. oral metronidazole can be used when these are not available.



other options:
option c: Familial Adenomatosis Polyposis (image 1)is caused due to a germline loss of function     mutation of the tumor suppressor gene, APc(adenomatous polyposis coli) on the 5th chromosome leading to multiple adenomas in the GI tract with 1oo% risk of malignant conversion associated     with congenital retinal pigment epithelium hypertrophy. variants of FAP are Gardner and Turcot   syndromes. Its features are described in the pearl attached.
option B: Esophageal varices (image 4) are tortuous dilated veins within the mucosa and
submucosa of the distal esophagus and proximal stomach. variceal hemorrhage is an emergency that can be treated medically by inducing splanchnic vasoconstriction or endoscopically by
sclerotherapy, balloon tamponade, or variceal ligation. It commonly occurs due to portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis.
option D: ulcerative colitis (uc) (image 2) which is characterized by continuous inflammation of the colon, pseudopolyps, biopsy findings of crypt distortion, ulceration, and infiltration of
inflammatory cells until the submucosal layer of the intestinal wall. Diagnosis can be made by colonoscopy followed by a biopsy.
uc is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that primarily affects the rectum and extends
proximally to involve the colon. Patients typically present with diarrhea, rectal bleeding,
tenesmus, crampy abdominal pain, and mucus discharge. They may also present with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, and weight loss.
The presentation of uc differs from that of crohn's disease, which is characterized by transmural inflammation of the intestine. Differences are mentioned in the pearl.",5159-3222.PNG,A,
Q22,what is the structure marked with the yellow arrow in the intraoperative image of spermatic cord of a patient with a congenital inguinal hernia?,"a)obturator vein
b)Femoral vein
c)Inferior epigastric vein
d)Testicular vein","The given clinical image is an open inguinal hernia repair of a child with a structure marked as the spermatic cord whose content includes the testicular vein.
Normally the funicular process of the peritoneum becomes obliterated after the testis has reached the scrotum. The scrotal part of the process remains patent and acquires the name 'tunica
vaginalis'. In case of congenital hernia, the whole process remains patent. with the increase in
abdominal pressure, abdominal contents come out through the patent peritoneal process. So it
reaches the bottom of the scrotum very quickly. It may so happen that the funicular process
remains patent up to the top of the testis. So the hernia stops at the top of the testis and is known as a congenital funicular hernia.
Indirect hernia comprises more than 8o% of inguinal hernias which are common in women and children. It occurs earlier than a direct hernia and is often complete. The two forms often seen    under indirect are congenital and acquired. unlike congenital, acquired hernias do not become   complete at once. They progress gradually. clinically a congenital hernia may present at a later   period.
The pearls attached below describe the inguinal canal and the differences between direct and indirect inguinal hernia.

Q23,"A chronic tobacco chewer presented with an ulcerative-nodular lesion of 4x5 cm over the lip, as shown below. which investigation would most likely confirm his diagnosis?","a)superficial incisional biopsy along with normal tissue
b)Deep incisional biopsy of Ulcer along with normal tissue
c)Excisional biopsy along with normal tissue
d)Brush biopsy","The given clinical scenario along with the image showing ulcero-proliferative mass is suggestive of lip cancer which is a type of oral carcinoma. Histopathological diagnosis in the form of a deep
incisional biopsy of an ulcer along with normal tissue is the gold standard for diagnosis.
Incisional biopsy is taken from the edge of the ulcer along with normal tissue as the centre of the ulcer is usually necrotic. A narrow deep biopsy is better than a shallow broad biopsy. (option A)
Excisional biopsy is done for smaller benign lesions. It is not done in oral cancers as they are
usually bigger in size. An excisional biopsy may increase the spread of cancer or cause functional impairment. (option c)
Techniques like brush biopsy and exfoliative biopsy are less sensitive. Hence, they are not used for diagnosis. (option D)",5160-3223.PNG,B,
Q24,A patient presented with recurrent swelling in his lower lip for the past 6 months as shown in the image. what is the diagnosis and treatment option for the patient?,"a)plunging ranula ; Incision and drainage
b)Mucous retention cyst ; Excision
c)Ranula ; Incision and Drainage
d)Mucocele ; Aspiration","The given scenario of recurrent swelling on the lip for 6 months and the image showing soft, and transparent cystic swelling points to a diagnosis of a mucous retention cyst. It has to be managed by an excision.
Mucous retention cysts result from duct obstruction by periductal scars or sialolithiasis (salivary gland stone formation) These cysts are mainly found in the ductal system of a minor salivary
gland. The cyst cavity may contain fragments of a sialolith or mucous material. Some may regress spontaneously but best management is done by an excision.
other options:
option A: cervical or plunging ranula- is a rare type of retention cyst arising from the sublingual gland. The mucous passes through the mylohyoid muscle diaphragm to enter the neck. clinically present as intraoral and cervical swelling. USG or MRI makes the diagnosis. Management
includes excision of the sublingual gland + aspiration of saliva out of the sac.





option C: oral ranula - It is a benign cystic lesion formed by extravasation of mucus, involving the sublingual gland. Clinically present as cystic swelling in the floor of the mouth. on examination
fluctuation test and transillumination test is positive. It is conservatively managed by   marsupialisation. Definitive management is the excision of the cyst. some may resolve spontaneously.


option D: Mucocele occurs when an obstruction in the ducts of minor salivary glands, such as
those in the labial or buccal areas, leads to swelling and aspiration is not a definitive treatment as it only provides temporary relief and does not prevent recurrence.",5161-3225.PNG,B,5197-3255.PNG;5197-3254.PNG
Q25,"A male child experienced acute scrotal pain while playing. He was taken to the emergency     department and a USG doppler was performed, followed by immediate surgical exploration. The following finding was seen. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)Testicular hematoma
b)strangulated inguinal hernia
c)Torsion of testicular appendage with Gangrene
d)Testicular torsion with Gangrene","The given clinical scenario along with the intraoperative specimen is suggestive of testicular torsion with gangrene.
Testicular torsion is the twisting of the spermatic cord and its contents such that the testicular   blood supply becomes compromised. It is a surgical emergency and if left untreated, the testes   may become gangrenous. Early surgery undertaken to untwist the testis gives a better outcome.
The following are anatomical predispositions to testicular torsion:
• High investment in the tunica vaginalis causes the testis to hang within the tunica like a clapper in a bell. This is the most common cause in adolescents and is typically a bilateral abnormality
• Inversion of the testis. The testis is rotated so that it lies transversely or upside down.
• separation of the epididymis from the body of the testis. This allows torsion of the testis on the pedicle that connects the testis with the epididymis.
Males in the age group of 1o-25 years present with acute scrotal or groin pain with associated nausea and vomiting. on examination, the scrotum appears swollen and tender.
Torsion Testis has to be differentiated from Acute epididymo-orchitis. This is done by prehn's    sign. In the case of acute epididymo-orchitis, the pain gets relieved on the elevation of the testis but not in the torsion of the testes.
other signs seen in torsion of the testis are:
• Deming’s sign: spasm of the cremaster muscle and the twisting of the cord cause the affected testis to be positioned higher
• Angell’s sign: The testis on the opposite side lies horizontally because of the bilaterality of the mesorchium between the testis and epididymis.
• cremastric reflex- absent on the side of the affected testis
The morphologic changes range from intense congestion to widespread hemorrhage to testicular infarction depending on the duration of torsion. In advanced stages, the testis is markedly
enlarged and consists entirely of soft, necrotic, hemorrhagic tissue.
A Doppler ultrasound may be taken to assess the blood supply but surgical exploration is still
indicated as a clinical decision. If the testis is infarcted after the cord is untwisted, an
orchidectomy must be undertaken and the opposite testis must be fixed to the scrotum to preserve
fertility and prevent torsion. If the affected testis is viable after the cord is untwisted, both the affected and the contralateral testes are fixed to the scrotum (bilateral orchiopexy) using
non-absorbable sutures.
other options :
option A: Testicular hematoma will usually be associated with trauma to the testis.





option B: strangulated hernia will have a history of inguinal swelling and the presence of cough   impulse over the swelling. the following image shows ischemic and necrotic bowel herniated into the sack.


option C: Testicular appendage torsion is torsion of vestigial appendage present along the testis. It has no function but torsion of appendage can be painful. It presents with a blue dot sign on
clinical examination. It is a self-limiting condition and conservative management is done.",5162-3227.PNG,D,5199-3257.PNG;5199-3256.PNG;5200-3258.PNG
Q26,Identify the procedure done in the given image.,"a)Bilateral orchidectomy with bilateral inguinal node dissection
b)Hernia repair
c)sentinel Lymph node biopsy
d)Total penectomy with inguinal node dissection","The given post-operative image suggests that this patient underwent Total penectomy
with inguinal lymph node dissection.
Total penectomy is done in cases of penile carcinoma if the stump is &lt; 2cm after resection of the tumour and partial penectomy is done if the stump is &gt;2cm. carcinoma of the penis is
commonly a squamous cell carcinoma. It arises from the skin of the glans penis or the prepuce. The lesion can be flat or warty in appearance.
The first lymph node to be involved is the superficial inguinal lymph node and thus, superficial   inguinal lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) helps evaluate the spread of penile cancer.
Tumours oflow-grade and low-stage are managed by Mohs’ surgery. Tumors involving the glans penis require glansectomy, and in advanced cases require partial penectomy.





other options:
option A: Testis is visible in the given image, therefore it is unlikely to be a specimen of Bilateral orchidectomy with bilateral inguinal node dissection.
option B: Hernia repair would be done higher up at the inguinal region.
option C: SLNB will be done through a smaller incision.",5162-3226.PNG,D,

c)It is most commonly malignant
d)It is more commonly seen in children","The given clinical features along with elevated urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid, and her CT scan showing a retroperitoneal tumor in the right lumbar region is suggestive of
pheochromocytoma whose familial forms are associated with MEN2A syndrome.
patients commonly present with a classical triad of palpitation, headache, and profuse sweating. pheochromocytoma is associated with:
• MEN-2: caused by germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene
• Familial paraganglioma syndrome: caused by germline mutations within the succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit B (SDHB), SDHD, and SDHC genes.
• Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome: caused by a germline mutation in the VHL gene.

Q29,A patient is diagnosed with stanford type B aortic dissection. what is the most appropriate initial management of this patient?,"a)Administer beta blocker and intensive blood pressure monitoring
b)Bypass graft
c)percutaneous endovascular stent
d)Balloon dilation","The initial management of patients with all types of aortic dissection is beta blocker medication to control hypertension along with intense blood pressure monitoring and pain management.
Aortic dissection occurs when a defect or flap occurs in the intima of the aorta. predisposing
factors include mainly age, hypertension, Marfan syndrome, and pregnancy. The most typical
presentation of aortic dissection is a tearing interscapular pain. The dissection may also result in  aortic wall rupture into the pericardium (cardiac tamponade) or mediastinum (left haemothorax).
Contrast-enhanced CT is currently the most preferred imaging modality for aortic dissection.
Double-lumen aorta is seen on CECT. Transesophageal echocardiography is preferred for patients



who are unstable for transportation.
Acute aortic dissection can be classified by the original DeBakey system, based on the location of the proximal tear and distal extent of the dissection flap, or the stanford system which uses the    location of the proximal tear alone.

Management of aortic dissection:
The initial management of patients with all types of aortic dissection is beta-blocker along with pain management. The preferred drug is esmolol. Hemodynamic stability is an important
consideration.
• stanford Type A (DeBakey Types I and II) requires surgical intervention once the patient's blood pressure is stabilized.
• stanford Type B (DeBakey type III) is best managed by antihypertensive drugs. For patients     with complicated type B dissection, percutaneously placed endovascular stents( option C )are      currently preferred. surgery ( options B and D ) is reserved for the rare patients not suitable for stenting.",5164-3229.PNG,A,5059-3166-2.png;5059-3166-3.png

below. Identify the calculi shown.","a)cystine
b)calcium phosphate
c)xanthine
d)calcium oxalate","The given clinical scenario and X-ray KUB showing a homogenous huge density with the smooth edge seen in the bladder is suggestive of struvite calculi, which is formed due to the precipitation of calcium, magnesium, and ammonium phosphate.
struvite stones (triple phosphate stones)  are usually seen in a setting of infection with
urease-producing bacteria like proteus, pseudomonas, and staphylococcus. They can grow very large and form a cast of the renal pelvis and calyces resulting in staghorn calculi. production
of urease enzyme by proteus, which hydrolyses urea to ammonia causes alkalinization of urine. Alkalinization of urine leads to precipitation of organic and inorganic compounds which
contributes to the formation of struvite stones.
Almost 9o% of the renal stones are radio-opaque and the remaining 1o% are radiolucent. The investigation of choice for renal stones is NCCT.
struvite stones are usually managed with percutaneous nephrolithotomy (pCNL) as it is usually larger in size and associated with Urinary tract infections.
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (EsWL) is a non-invasive method that generates
shockwaves outside the body, which are focused on the stones. It is the most common method of treating urinary tract stones nowadays. stones up to approximately 1.5 cm in size are suitable for this form of treatment.
pCNL is indicated in:
• staghorn calculi - stone &gt;2 cm
• Multiple stones - &gt;1 cm
• proximal ureteral stone - &gt;1 cm

Q31,Identify the given drain.,"a)underwater seal drain
b)closed suction drain
c)penrose drain
d)Nelaton drain","The Romo vac drain, depicted in the image, is a closed suction drain commonly used after mastectomy.
Drains are placed at surgical sites to freely collect the air or fluids that may accumulate. This enhances wound healing by preventing the formation of unnecessary cavities. Drains are
prophylactic in elective surgeries and therapeutic in emergency surgeries. Drains can be -
• open - They are based on the principle of gravity
• semi-open - Their action is based on capillary effect
• closed - They carry out their actions through suction
suction drains are commonly used in chest, breast, abdominal, thyroid, and plastic surgeries.
They remove intraperitoneal secretions, anastomotic leaks, and blood from hemorrhage at the  surgical site. Romo vac drain is a negative suction drain closed drain kept in the subcutaneous tissue. Romo vac drain is indicated in modified radical mastectomy, subcutaneous swelling
excision, and amputations.
special types of drains:
• chest drains (option A) are connected to an underwater seal to aid the exit of air from the pleural cavity. They are used in pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and hemothorax.
• After surgical exploration of the bile duct, the sphincter of oddi goes into spasm. To facilitate drainage of bile, a T tube may be used.
Drain insertion site care: The site of insertion of the drain is kept clean by drying and patting the drain insertion site with a clean towel after bath. The dressing is changed daily with folded gauze pieces placed below and above the drain site.
Removal of drains: The catheter at the site is milked for residual collections. It is then clamped
and the suture holding the catheter is cut. The tube is then gently pulled out and any clots at the   perforation end are removed. The time of removal of drains for various conditions is given below.
• Drains used in surgeries like thyroidectomy are usually removed within 24 hours. Their main purpose is to cover postoperative bleeding.



• In a mastectomy, a drain is placed for 5 days to collect serous collections.
• Drains used to cover the colorectal anastomoses are placed for 5-7 days.
• Common bile duct T-tube drains are usually placed for 1o days.
• Drains for infections are removed when the infection subsides or when the content of the drain is minimal.
After the drain is removed, a folded gauze is placed over the drain insertion area. The dressing can be removed after 24 hours. The patient may be given an antibiotic ointment to apply over the area for a week.

c)callous ulcer
d)Neuropathic ulcer","The image of a healing ulcer with a sloping edge in the Gaiter's area indicates a venous ulcer.
venous ulcers due to chronic venous insufficiency are most commonly seen in the lower ■ of the leg and foot. They usually lie just proximal to the medial or lateral malleolus.
Ambulatory venous hypertension is the most acceptable theory in the pathophysiology. They have  a sloping edge and the floor contains granulation tissue covered by slough and exudate. Marjolin’s ulcer is a type of squamous cell carcinoma seen in chronic long-standing venous ulcers. These are  accompanied by lipodermatosclerosis and hemosiderosis.
Management of venous ulcers:
1) Bisgaard's regimen (4Es)
• Education of the patient
• Elevation of the affected limb to reduce the edema
• Elastic compression stockings - The ideal interface pressure in venous ulceration is 35-4o mmHg.
• Evaluation
2) 4-layer bandaging system comprising of:
• orthopaedic wool
• cotton crepe
• Elastic bandage - first compressive layer



• Cohesive bandage - second compressive layer
3) Antibiotics are given only if the wound is infected.
4) Regular dressing.
5) Medical management by oral pentoxifylline is considered which helps in reducing the viscosity and improving circulation.
6) surgical management by ulcer excision with pinch mesh grafting has a good outcome and helps in preventing recurrence.
Note: vacuum-assisted closure (vAC) is a negative pressure dressing. An occlusive dressing is
placed over the sore and it is connected to vAC that generates -125mmHg of pressure. It is used in chronic non-healing ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, burn wounds, and bed sores.

Q33,A patient underwent surgery for a leg ulcer due to burns. what is the mechanism by which a graft receives its nutritional supply on postoperative day 3?,"a)Inosculation
b)Imbibition
c)Diffusion
d)Neovascularisation","The phase of skin graft uptake in which the graft receives its nutritional supply on postoperative day 3 is known as inosculation. It is the period during which the graft is most at risk for failure.
split skin graft survives the transplantation surgery by the following process:
• The graft survives the first 48 hours because of the imbibition (option B) of plasma from the wound bed.



• After 48 hours, fine anastomotic connections are made, which leads to the inosculation of blood.
• Neovascularization (option D ) is the process by which new blood vessels form, directly invading the graft and restoring the pink color of the skin. There is no step of diffusion (option C) in the
process of graft transplantation.
skin grafts can be broadly divided into two categories:
split-thickness skin graft (Thiersch graft ): partial-thickness skin grafts consisting of the epidermis and a portion of the dermis are called split-thickness skin grafts. Less dermis in the split-thickness skin graft translates into less primary contraction (the degree to which a graft shrinks in surface     area after harvesting and before grafting) and more secondary contraction (the degree to which a   graft shrinks during healing).
Full-thickness skin grafts (wolfe graft) include the epidermis and entire dermis, with portions of   the sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and hair follicles. More dermis in the full-thickness skin graft translates into more primary contraction and less secondary contraction.
Advantages of split skin graft over full-thickness skin graft:
• Large grafts can be harvested.
• In the case of thinner split-thickness grafts, the donor site heals more rapidly and can be reused in severe cases such
• as burns.
• uptake is good.
• Meshing can be done, i.e., small splits are made in graft and any exudates collected can come out through this, improving graft takeup. It also allows the graft to expand.
Advantages of full-thickness skin graft over split skin graft:
• It has a lesser degree of post-graft contraction
• Best cosmetic appearance as they include the highest number of skin appendage elements.",5167-3234.PNG,A,

Thyroid Nodule. Assessing the biochemical function of the thyroid, i.e. thyroid function test (TFT) which includes serum TsH, T3, and T4 is the first investigation done on any thyroid condition.





Investigations in a patient with Solitary thyroid nodule
• Thyroid function tests- Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are the first step in evaluating suspected thyroid disease. Based on TSH levels, further investigations is decided.
• ultrasonography is a non-invasive and inexpensive way to stratify the risk of the nodule into benign or malignant tissue.
• FNAC: Although other investigations can assist in evaluating a nodule, FNA cytology provides a definitive diagnosis.
• Radioiodine Thyroid scan: It helps to differentiate between a hot nodule and a cold nodule.
Thyroid nodules that absorb radioiodine are called hot nodules. These nodules produce excess
thyroid hormones and are functional nodules. whereas, the thyroid nodules that do not absorb
radioiodine are called cold nodules and they indicate non-functional nodules. It is mostly done by I-123 radioisotope. (option C)
other options:
option A: I-131 radioisotope is more commonly used to radio-ablate the thyroid tissue.
option B: PET scan has no role in the evaluation of Solitary thyroid nodules.",5167-3233.PNG,D,5211-3264.PNG
Q35,"A 76 year old elderly man presents with confusion. He is on antihypertensive medication, and on aspirin after a recent MI. He recalls a trivial fall from chair 3 weeks ago. other
neurological examination was normal. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Epidural hemorrhage
b)subarachnoid hemorrhage
c)subdural hemorrhage
d)Normal","The given clinical vignette along with the CT image showing a crescent-shaped hyperdense lesion that crosses the suture lines is indicative of chronic subdural hematoma/hemorrhage.
Subdural hemorrhage (SDH) is a collection of blood between the dura and the arachnoid layers of the meninges. Most commonly, it results from the rupture of cortical bridging veins. Non-contrast CT is the investigation of choice.
Radiographic features of subdural hemorrhages:
• Typically unilateral (85%)



• Crescent-like distribution (concavo-convex) around the periphery of the brain.
• They are not limited by sutures and can fill dural reflection
• Crescent-shaped hypodense lesion on axial CT: Chronic subdural hemorrhage
• Hyperdense collections on CT: Acute subdural hemorrhage.

other options:
option A: Epidural haemorrhage will be usually lens-shaped and is limited by sutures.
option B: subarachnoid haemorrhage will show Hyperdensity in the subarachnoid space.",5168-3235.PNG,C,5212-3266.PNG;5212-3265.PNG
Q36,"A 45-year-old male presents with acute retention of urine which is drained via the suprapubic route. A retrograde urethrogram was done and is as shown below. what is the most
appropriate management?","a)serial dilatation
b)urethral repair with graft from buccal mucosa
c)Metallic catheter placement
d)Endoscopic urethrotomy","The given clinical scenario with a long-segment urethral stricture which will be best managed by urethral repair with a graft from buccal mucosa.
The management of a urethral stricture depends on the site, the length, and the cause of the stricture. They include:
• Endoscopic urethrotomy - The stricture is released using a knife passed through a rigid urethroscope. This is done for a short and incomplete stricture. (option D)
• urethroplasty - Excision of the stenosed length of the urethra and re-anastomosis is done.
End-end anastomoses are done for strictures that are short and complete, while for a long
complete stricture, a buccal mucosa graft can be used to bridge the gap. It is considered when a stricture is due to trauma or recurred following endoscopic treatment.
• urethral dilation - The urethra is stretched using urethral dilators. This is a blind procedure and it can cause injury. Hence, it is not done frequently. (option A)
• Intermittent self-dilatation - In patients with recurrent strictures who cannot undergo urethroplasty, intermittent self-dilatation with soft hydrophilic catheters is done daily.
• Metallic catheter placement - This is usually done for palliative care in end stage malignant diseases and recurrent cases. (option C)",5169-3237.PNG,B,
Q37,A patient diagnosed with GERD has no improvement after long-term medical therapy. He underwent surgical treatment for GERD. Identify the procedure.,"a)Toupet's fundoplication
b)Dor's fundoplication
c)watson's fundoplication
d)Nissen's fundoplication","The procedure in the given image shows a 36o-degree wrap, which is known as Nissen's fundoplication; this procedure is done for GERD. Nissen's fundoplication is a complete
fundoplication procedure.
Fundoplication is the procedure in which the fundus of the stomach is wrapped
around the lower end of the esophagus. In the Nissen's fundoplication procedure, the fundus is wrapped the entire 36o degrees around the esophagus.




The most common complication of Nissen’s fundoplication is the gas-bloat syndrome. In this   condition, patients are unable to belch gas from the stomach into the oesophagus. This causes increased gas in the stomach, resulting in a bloating sensation, abdominal discomfort, and
flatulence.
other options:
option A: The toupet procedure is the re-creation of a sphincter around the EGJ done by wrapping the fundus around the oesophagus. A posterior 18o-27o-degree wrap is used.
option B: The Dor procedure is fundoplication, most commonly used in the setting of the esophagal myotomy. It consists of an anterior 18o-degree wrap.
option C: watson's fundoplication is a 9o-degree anterior fundoplication. It is reported to achieve good reflux control while permitting burping and active vomiting and reducing gas bloat.",5169-3236.PNG,D,5213-3267.PNG;5214-3268.PNG
