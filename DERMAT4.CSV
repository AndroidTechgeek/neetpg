Q1,"A female patient presents with active genital warts with a history of recurrence, but her husband doesn't have it. what advice will you give to prevent transmission?","a)Give continuous prophylaxis to the patient
b)Give prophylactic anti-virals to the husband
c)Give anti-virals whenever active lesions are present
d)Don't involve in intercourse when active lesions are present","The advice to prevent transmission is to not involve in intercourse when active genital warts are present.
Genital warts are caused by HPV and transmitted through the sexual route. Antivirals are not very effective against anogenital warts. Biological treatment options like podophyllin, imiquimod,
5-fluorouracil are given. The best way to prevent transmission of infection is by avoiding sexual intercourse when active lesions are present.",,D,
Q2,"A male baby born to a non-consanguineous couple develops blisters on areas of friction. Their previous baby also had similar complaints and died at the age of 2 weeks. what is the
diagnosis?","a)Epidermolysis bullosa
b)chronic bullous disorder of childhood
c)congenital syphilis
d)Neonatal pemphigus","The clinical history given in the question points to a diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa congenita.
Epidermolysis bullosa is a mechanobullous disease characterized by blistering in areas of
mechanical trauma. Blisters are commonly seen in trauma-prone areas like hands, feet, elbows, and knees. There are three types of epidermolysis bullosa:
• Epidermolysis bullosa simplex - defective K5/K14 protein
• Junctional epidermolysis bullosa - defective Laminin
• Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa - defective collagen-7
The image below shows epidermolysis bullosa lesions on the foot:





other options:
option B: chronic bullous disorder of childhood - It typically presents with bullous lesions having a string of pearls/cluster of jewel appearance (image below). It is an IgA-mediated immunobullous disorder. It manifests in early childhood and is not a congenital condition.


option c: congenital syphilis - syphilitic pemphigus presents as a vesiculobullous disorder. The investigation of choice is VDRL.
option D: Neonatal pemphigus - It is an autoimmune blistering disease caused by the transfer of maternal IgG autoantibodies to desmoglein 3 to the neonate through the placenta when the
mother is affected with pemphigus. It is clinically characterized by transient flaccid blisters and erosions on the skin and, rarely, the mucous membranes.",,A,3570-2244.PNG;3570-2243.PNG
Q3,A rose gardener with a history of thorn prick presents with the following lesions. what is the possible causative agent?,"a)streptococcus pyogenes
b)sporothrix schenkii
c)strongyloides stercoralis
d)staphylococcus aureus","The given image shows the distribution of lesions along lymphatics. This distribution along with the history of thorn pick is suggestive of the causative agent sporothrix schenkii.
sporothrix schenkii causes rose gardener's disease. It is a saprophyte that lives on grass and plants. Hence a history of thorn prick in farmers or gardeners is an important clue.
other causes of skin lesion distributed along lymphatics is fish tankgranuloma caused by Mycobacterium marinum.",3564-2238.PNG,B,
Q4,A school-going child who had applied henna comes to dermatology OPD with the following lesions. what is the diagnosis?,"a)contact dermatitis due to henna
b)Dermatitis artefacta
c)polymorphous light eruption
d)vitiligo","The likely diagnosis in this case is dermatitis artefacta (factitious dermatitis).
Dermatitis artefacta is a psychodermatological excoriation disorder with a female preponderance, commonly affecting adolescents and young adults, where elaborate techniques (using sharp
objects, cigarettes, lighters, chemicals etc.) are used to self induce skin lesions.
The morphology of the lesions are varied, with oddly linear, clear-cut and angular edges,
surrounded by normal looking skin. These lesions appear with no prodromal stage or associated  symptoms as they are self inflicted. They are distributed over easy to reach areas of the body and have a varied appearance based on the mode of injury.
• option A: contact dermatitis is due to contact with allergic agents such as
paraphenylenediamine (PPD). Presentation can vary from erythema, swelling, papules, vesicles   and in severe cases, blisters on the areas of contact with the allergen (henna, in this case). There exists a sequence of inflammatory changes here, unlike the lesions in dermatitis artefacta.
• option B: Polymorphic light eruptions as the name suggests are seen over sunlight-exposed areas of the body. The lesions are polymorphic and are symmetrically distributed.
• option c: vitiligo is characterized by patchy involvement of skin with hypopigmentation.",3564-2237.PNG,B,
Q5,A 4o-year-old woman who presented with complaints offever and joint pain develops the following lesion on her nose after a few days of taking NSAIDs. what is your diagnosis?,"a)Dengue
b)chikungunya
c)Melasma
d)Fixed drug eruption","The given history of fever and joint pain along with centrofacial hyperpigmentation shown in the image point towards a diagnosis of chikungunya. Hyperpigmentation associated with
chikungunya fever is macular and most commonly affects the nose and cheeks.
Nose pigmentation is striking in cases of chikungunya fever and is termed as chik sign. It appears as the fever subsides and persists for about 3-6 months.
Hyperpigmentation of the centrofacial face (nose and cheeks) mimics melasma and may be misdiagnosed if proper history is not taken.
Another close differential is fixed drug eruptions (FDE). FDE is a type of delayed hypersensitivity reaction. It is characterized by well-defined brown, hyperpigmented plaques that may follow
vesiculobullous lesions. They occur on lips, hands, legs, face, genitalia, and oral mucosa, and can cause a burning sensation. They usually present 3o min to 8 h after drug exposure and recur at



the same location on re-exposure. NSAIDs, paracetamol and Co■trimoxazole are the most common drugs causing FDE.
The image below shows FDE on upper lip area:",3533-2211.PNG,B,3545-2222.PNG
Q6,Methylisothiazolinone (MI) in cosmetics is used as?,"a)Surfactant
b)Humectant
c)Emulsifier
d)preservative","Methylisothiazolinone (MI) in cosmetics is used as a preservative to inhibit bacterial growth. It is permitted to be used up to the level of 1oo ppm.
Several cases of allergic contact dermatitis due to MI were reported due to its presence in wet wipes, hair cosmetics, facial cosmetics, deodorants, and sunscreens.
Furthermore, cases of airborne exposure to MI causing severe airborne and generalized dermatitis from recently painted walls and even from toilet cleaners have been described.",,D,
Q7,The given condition is caused by which drug?,"a)Actinomycin
b)Bleomycin
c)Mitomycin C
d)Doxorubicin","The given image shows flagellate dermatitis. It is caused by bleomycin.
Flagellate dermatitis starts as bands of pruritic, flagellate, erythema over the trunk, and
extremities within few hours to 6 months after administration. The rash heals with persistent flagellate hyperpigmentation.
No treatment is necessary since the lesions usually disappear when bleomycin is discontinued. If the patient is itchy, managing pruritus with an antihistamine may limit trauma to the skin, and    thus avoid further hyperpigmentation.
Another side effect that one needs to watch out for with the use of bleomycin is the development of pulmonary fibrosis.",3566-2239.PNG,B,
Q8,which of the following does not present with maculopapular rash?,"a)zoster (shingles)
b)Rubella
c)Dengue (during febrile phase)
d)Measles","A maculopapular rash is not seen in zoster (shingles).
shingles cause vesicular lesions that are grouped together and specific to a dermatome.


Maculopapular rashes are seen in:
• Rubella
• Dengue (febrile phase)
• Measles
• chikungunya (acute infectious phase)
• Erythema infectiosum
• zika virus
• west Nile virus
• Infectious mononucleosis

Type of ra sh	Description
Macule	Flatlesion with a well-circum scribed change in skin color   < 1 cm
papule	Elevated solidskin lesion < 1 cm
vesicle	smallfluidcontaining blister",,A,3560-2233.PNG;3561-2234.PNG
Q9,A child presents to OPD with tense bullae over the torso. Biopsy of the lesion showed a subepidermal level of blistering and neutrophil infiltration. what is the drug of choice?,"a)Rituximab
b)Dapsone
c)cyclosporine
d)Azathioprine","This clinical scenario with tense blisters showing subepidermal separation and neutrophilic
infiltration at the basement membrane points towards a diagnosis of IgA pemphigoid or linear IgA disease or chronic bullous disease of childhood. The drug of choice is dapsone. It is
bacteriostatic against M. leprae.
It also has an anti-inflammatory action by decreasing the action of neutrophil enzymes. Hence, it is useful in the treatment of IgA pemphigoid, linear IgA disease and chronic bullous disease of
childhood.",3567-2241.PNG,B,
Q10,what is the probable diagnosis of this condition affecting hair?,"a)Trichorhexis nodosa
b)Trichorexis invaginata
c)Trichothiodystrophy
d)Monilethrix","The given clinical image of hair seen under polarising microscopy reveals tiger tail banding (alternating light and dark bands) characteristic of trichothiodystrophy.
Trichothiodystrophy is an autosomal recessive condition causing defective DNA repair. It causes brittle sulfur-deficient hair, photosensitivity, ichthyosis and systemic involvement. unlike
xeroderma pigmentosum (a similar condition with defective DNA repair), there is no risk of skin cancer.
option A: Trichorrhexis nodosa is associated with node formation and fractures. The classic appearance, shown in the image below, is known as thrust paintbrush appearance as if two
paintbrushes are rubbing against each other. It is associated with trauma to the hair shaft and arginosuccinic aciduria.





B- Trichorrhexis invaginata or bamboo hair is characterized by invagination of the distal hair shaft into the proximal portion. It is seen in Netherton's syndrome. It is also called golf-tee or ball and   socket appearance as seen below.


option D: Monilethrix, seen in the image below, is characterized by beaded hair and is fragile at the constricted sites. It occurs as an isolated condition or can occur in Menkes disease.",3567-2240.PNG,C,3575-2246.PNG;3575-2246.PNG;3575-2245.PNG;3576-2247.PNG
Q11,A patient with a known case of chronic plaque psoriasis with more than 5o% skin involvement presents to you. which of the following will you not recommend?,"a)oral methotrexate
b)NB UVB
c)oral steroids
d)oral cyclosporine","oral/systemic steroids are not used in the management of chronic plaque psoriasis. Topical steroids may be used.
systemic steroids are avoided because the withdrawal of systemic steroids causes the development of pustular psoriasis.
The only indication of using systemic steroids in psoriasis is generalized pustular psoriasis in pregnancy (impetigo herpetiformis).
other options maybe used in treatment of extensive (&gt;3o%) chronic plaque psoriasis.",,C,
Q12,Identify the type of skin lesion.,"a)Nummular
b)Annular
c)Discoid
d)Target","The given image shows ring-shaped lesions with central clearing, which are characteristic of annular lesions.
In annular lesions, only the edges are active and appear raised, or in a different color. They are seen in tinea corporis, granuloma annulare, borderline leprosy, and psoriasis.",3568-2242.PNG,B,
