Q1,A 15-year-old girl presents with itchy lesions on her arm as shown. Her family history is positive for asthma. what could be the most probable diagnosis?,"a)seborrhoeic dermatitis
b)Atopic dermatitis
c)Allergic contact dermatitis
d)Erysipelas","The clinical scenario depicting pruritic lesions at a flexural site along with a family history of
atopy (asthma) is suggestive of atopic dermatitis (AD) or atopic eczema (AE). The scratch
marks and excoriations shown in the image are due to pruritis, which is the hallmark feature of AD.
AD is a chronic relapsing inflammatory condition. It presents with erythematous macules,
papules and vesicles that often start in early childhood, usually less than 2 years old. The lesions later become excoriated and lichenified. It is frequently associated with dryness of the skin
and secondary infections. In infancy, the lesions initially appear on face (sparing the napkin area) and later on extensor aspect of knees and elbows as the child starts crawling. In later childhood     and in adults, the principal site of involvement is flexures.
The filaggrin monomers in keratinocytes in the epidermis bind and aggregate keratin bundles and intermediate filaments to form the epidermal barrier. Any damage/dysfunction of this barrier is     associated with an increased risk of developing AD. Damage to this barrier can be due to
environmental factors (detergents, hard water, uv light) or local inflammatory
reactions. Dysfunction of the barrier can be due to genetic mutation of the FLG gene leading to reduced filaggrin production or local immunomodulatory effects leading to reduced filaggrin
expression.
other options:
option A: seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by
erythema, pruritus, scaling, flaking, or crusting of the skin. It is often associated with Malasezzia fungal infection. A milder form of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp is commonly known as
dandruff.





option C: Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is an inflammatory condition caused due to a delayed hypersensitivity reaction (Type 4 hypersensitivity) to a specific allergen that comes into direct
contact with the skin.patients usually present with pruritus, erythema, swelling,
papules, and papulovesicles. some common allergens include nickel (found in artificial jewelry),  ppD/para phenylene diamine (in hair dye), chromate (in cement), rubber or latex, cosmetics, etc. patch test (image below) is used for the diagnosis of ACD.


option D: Erysipelas is a bacterial skin infection caused by streptococcus pyogenes (Group A
streptococcus) characterized by raised, erythematous sharply demarcated rapidly spreading skin lesions, along with systemic symptoms like fever and chills. The skin may also have a peau
d'orange or orange peel-like appearance.",3577-2248.PNG,B,3580-2250.PNG;3558-2231.PNG;3581-2251.PNG
Q2,Bindi Leukoderma is caused by which chemical?,"a)Mono-benzyl ether of Hydroquinone (MBH)
b)crocein scarlet MOO and solvent yellow 3
c)p-phenylenediamine (PPD)
d)Para Tertiary butylphenol (PTBP)","Bindi leukoderma is caused by para tertiary butylphenol (PTBP) present in adhesive sticker bindi. • This is called as contact Leukoderma or chemical Leukoderma in which the chemical increases  sensitivity and induces apoptosis of the melanocytes in the area of contact.
• There is also evidence that azo dyes, by virtue of structural similarity to tyrosine, can directly inhibit melanogenesis by competing with that amino acid for binding with tyrosinase enzyme.
common chemicals in the Indian set up which cause chemical leukoderma are:

Bindi Leukoderma	Para Tertiary butyl phenol (P TBP)
synthetic leather, rubber slip pers, Latex condoms, rubber  gloves	Mono-benzyl ether of Hydroq uinone (MBH)-Rubber Antio   xidant
Hair dye	p-phenylenediamine (PPD)
Alta (red colour like henna)	crocein scarlet MOO and sol vent yellow 3(azo dyes)",3588-2260.PNG,D,3595-2267.PNG;3595-2266.PNG;3595-2265.PNG
Q3,The most common triggering factor of the given condition is ________,"a)vaccination
b)Malignancy
c)Drugs
d)Infection","The given image shows characteristic target lesions of erythema multiforme. This most commonly occurs following a herpes simplex virus infection.
The common triggers are:
• Herpes simplex infection
• Mycoplasma infection
• Bacterial infections
• Fungal infections
• vaccinations
• Malignancy- carcinoma, lymphoma, leukemia
• Drugs- sulfonamides, rifampicin, penicillins, hydantoin derivatives
• Miscellaneous- lupus erythematosus (Rowell syndrome), sarcoidosis, polyarteritis nodosa  Erythema multiforme is best regarded as a self■limiting cytotoxic dermatitis resulting from cell■mediated hypersensitivity.
It presents clinically with a spectrum of macular, papular, or urticarial lesions, as well as the classic acral iris or ‘target lesions’.
Target lesions are less than 3 cm in diameter, rounded, and have three zones:
• central area of dusky erythema or purpura
• Middle paler zone of edema
• outer ring of erythema with a well■defined edge
Lesions may involve the palms and the trunk. oral and genital mucosal membranes lesions are associated with erosions

Q4,A young female presented with vaginal itching and green frothy genital discharge. strawberry cervix is seen on examination. what will be the drug of choice?,"a)Doxycycline
b)oral fluconazole
c)Metronidazole
d)Azithromycin","vaginal itching and green frothy discharge in a young female with strawberry vagina points towards trichomoniasis. Metronidazole is the drug of choice for trichomoniasis.
It is is the most common parasitic infection in humans in the industrialized world.
It is caused by Trichomonas vaginalis, an anaerobic, flagellated protozoa, exists only as a trophozoite (no cyst stage).
Diagnosis is made by detection of motile flagella during microscopic examination of wet mounts. Direct immunofluorescent antibody staining is more sensitive (7o-9o%) than wet mount.
Culture is done on Feinberg-whittington media.
Treatment: DOC- Metronidazole 2 gm single oral dose. All sexual partners must be treated to prevent reinfection, especially from asymptomatic males. Tinidazole can also be used for the  treatment of trichomoniasis.
The image below shows strawberry vagina seen in trichomoniasis:",,C,3598-2269.PNG
Q5,what is correct regarding the diagnosis based on the given image?,"a)The lesions are not infectious
b)Trigeminal dermatome is most commonly affected
c)Anterior nerve roots are more commonly involved
d)Mucous membranes within the affected dermatomes are involved","The above image shows unilateral, painful, grouped vesicles in a single dermatome suggestive of    herpes zoster or shingles. The mucous membranes within the affected dermatomes are involved in shingles.
Herpes zoster/shingles is an acute cutaneous segmental eruption due to the reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus from dorsal root ganglia. An earlier infection with varicella is essential
before zoster can occur.
The first symptom of zoster is usually pain, 1-3 days after which the lesions appear. occasionally,  the pain may not be followed by the eruption (‘zoster sine eruptione’). The patients are infectious, both from the virus in the lesions and nasopharynx.
The most commonly involved dermatomes in decreasing order of frequency are thoracic &gt;
cervical &gt; trigeminal &gt; lumbosacral. The incidence of ophthalmic zoster increase with age. The posterior nerve roots and ganglia show inflammatory changes.
Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is a variant of zoster involving the ophthalmic division of the
trigeminal nerve (v1). Herpes zoster oticus/Ramsay Hunt syndrome is another variant involving the geniculate ganglion and presents with ipsilateral facial nerve palsy, otalgia and vesicles over external ear.
zoster is a self-limiting infection but it is painful and carries a risk of secondary infection and    post-herpetic neuralgia. Analgesia and treatment of secondary infections are sufficient for mild infections.
Indications for antivirals in vzv (Acyclovir 8oo mg):
• painful zoster infections in adults
• Facial zoster at any age
• Immunocompromised",3589-2261.PNG,D,
Q6,what is the diagnosis seen in the image below?,"a)candidal paronychia
b)staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome
c)candidal intertrigo
d)Diabetic foot ulcer","The condition shown in the image is candidal intertrigo.
It is a candidal infection of opposing skin surfaces, which presents as erythema with a little moist exudation starting deep in a fold. when the web spaces of the toes or fingers are affected, marked maceration with a thick, white, horny layer is usually prominent.
As the condition progresses, it spreads beyond the area of contact, usually developing the typical    features of candidosis with a fringed, irregular edge and subcorneal pustules rupturing to give tiny erosions, and then further peeling of the stratum corneum.
Treatment:
Topical antifungal agents such as nystatin, ketoconazole, and clotrimazole are routinely used.",,C,3590-2263.PNG
Q7,which of the following is commonly associated with the condition shown below?,"a)oil drop sign
b)Leukonychia striata
c)pterygium of nails
d)pitting of nails","The condition shown in the image above is alopecia areata. classically, it causes fine stippled pitting of the nails.
It is a chronic inflammatory disease which causes non-scarring patches of hair loss, especially in genetically predisposed.
The most characteristic lesion is a smooth circumscribed patch of alopecia, which has short     extractable broken hairs called as exclamation mark hair. However, there is always sparing of white hairs in the region affected.
other options :
subungal oil drop sign is a highly specific pathognomonic sign seen in Nail psoriasis. It is a yellow-red discolouration in the nail bed resembling a drop of oil.




Leukonychia striata are lines that extend across the nail and lie parallel to lunula. They are seen in Hypoalbuminemic states such as nephrotic syndrome .


Nail pterygium is a wing-shaped deformity of nail due to a central fibrotic band which divides the nail into two parts in the proximal.
• Dorsal pterygium is seen in lichen planus.
• ventral pterygium is seen in trauma, systemic sclerosis, Raynaud phenomenon, lupus erythematosus, familial subungual pterygium, and infections.",3590-2262.PNG,D,3590-2262.PNG;3599-2270.PNG;3600-2272.PNG;3600-2271.PNG
Q8,Identify the condition given in the image :,"a)Dermatomyositis
b)Acanthosis nigricans
c)pityriasis rotunda
d)Melasma","The condition in the given image is acanthosis nigricans. It is characterized by thickened, gray-brown velvety plaques seen in flexural areas such as the back of the neck, axillae,



inframammary creases, waist, and groin.
The causal mechanism is due to the secretion of epidermal growth factors in the region involved. It can be benign or malignancy-associated.
• Benign - commonly associated with obesity or insulin resistance, usually mild.
• Malignancy - much less common, associated with gastric, lung, and uterine cancers. Acanthosis nigricans can also be seen in the following:
• Drugs such as nicotinic acid used to treat hyperlipidemia
• sudden onset of multiple seborrhoeic keratoses",3591-2264.PNG,B,
