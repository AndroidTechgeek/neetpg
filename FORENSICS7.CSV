Q1,"A deceased male was brought to the morgue for a ■post-mortem examination. His relatives reported that he had a tattoo over his skin, which was not found on examination. which of  the following structures would you examine?","a)Lymph nodes
b)Liver
c)Arteries
d)Skin","The lymph nodes should be examined in this case.
Some amount of material or dye used for creating tattoo marks is transported through lymph to the regional lymph nodes. Hence, in cases where a tattoo mark has disappeared naturally or has been removed, the lymph nodes must be examined.",,A,
Q2,which Section of the IPC/BNS deals with the punishment of perjury?,"a)191/ BNS 227
b)192/ BNS 228
c)193/ BNS 229
d)197/ BNS 234","The punishment of perjury is dealt with under Ipc 193, has now been updated to BNS 229.
perjury is defined as the offence of wilfully telling an untruth or making a misrepresentation under oath.",,C,
Q3,The most common drug which causes physical dependence is?,"a)ketamine
b)Heroin
c)LSD
d)Phencyclidine","Heroin is the most common drug which can cause physical dependence.
physical dependence is defined is a condition where withdrawal of a drug after its prolonged use    causes physiological and emotional illness, often referred to as the withdrawal syndrome. Neither  physical dependence nor withdrawal symptoms occur with hallucinogens. Although it is necessary to note that a user can develop a psychological dependence on the insight-inducing experiences of episodes of hallucinogen use. Hence, all 3 hallucinogens - ketamine, LSD, and phencyclidine
(pcp) does not cause physical dependence.
According to the world drug report 2019, released by the United Nations office on drugs and   crime (UNODc), the most common drugs used across the world (in decreasing order) include:
• cannabis
• Opioids
• Amphetamine and prescription stimulants
• Ecstacy

Q4,"A 5-year-old child with a ■history of perianal pain is brought to the OPD. On subjecting the  specimen from the perianal region to a test, it produces yellow rhombic crystals of spermine picrate. what is the test done?","a)Barberio test
b)Florence test
c)Takayama test
d)Teichmann test","The test done in the scenario is the Barberio test.
It is used to detect seminal fluid. when saturated aqueous or alcoholic solution of picric acid is added to the spermatic fluid, yellow needle-shaped rhombic crystals of spermine picrate are
produced.
Florence test:



• used to detect: semen
• stain used: 1o% hydrochloric acid and Florence solution (potassium iodide, iodine, and water)
• Finding: If semen is present, dark brown rhombic or needle-shaped crystals of choline iodide appear immediately
Takayama test (Haemochromogen crystal test):
• used to detect: bloodstains
• stain used: Takayama reagent
• Finding: If bloodstain is present, pink feathery crystals of haemochromogen or reduced alkaline haematin appear in a few minutes
Teichmann test (Haemin crystal Test):
• used to detect: bloodstains
• stain used: glacial acetic acid and a small crystal of sodium chloride
• Finding: If bloodstain is present, faint yellowish-red to brownish-black rhombic crystals of
haemin or haematin chloride appear. when hydrogen peroxide is added, the haematin crystals give bubbles of gas",,A,
Q5,"In the case of rape of a young child, the hymen is usually:","a)Ruptured since it is superficially situated
b)Ruptured since it is very thin
c)unruptured since it is deeply situated
d)unruptured since it is highly elastic","In the case of a young child, the hymen is deeply situated and usually intact after intercourse. As the vagina is very small, it is impossible for the penetration of the adult organ to take place.
In children, there are few or no signs of general violence, as the child is unaware of the assault and incapable of resisting. A few indicators for inquiry are:
• pain on urination and/or defecation
• Abdominal pain
• Inability to sleep
• sudden withdrawal from peers/adults
• Feelings of anxiety
• Nervousness
• Helplessness
• A feeling of ending one’s life",,C,
Q6,In the civil negligence case against a doctor who bears the onus of proof?,"a)patient
b)police not under rank of sub inspector
c)Magistrate
d)Doctor","In the case of civil negligence, the burden of proof is on the patient.
The question of civil negligence arises when a suit is filed in a civil court:



• By a patient or his/her relatives against the doctor for getting compensation from the doctor if he/she has suffered an injury due to the doctor's negligence.
• By a doctor against the patient or his/her relatives to collect the fees, the payment of which has been refused due to alleged professional negligence by the doctor.
In either case, the patient has to prove that the doctor has committed professional negligence.
To prove negligence, all the following four elements must be present:
• Duty - A duty of care by the doctor must exist.
• Dereliction - The physician must maintain the standard of a 'prudent physician' under similar circumstances. If the physician fails to maintain the standard of care, it is called dereliction.
• Direct causation - The negligent act or omission must directly cause the injury without any intervening cause.
• Damage - The negligent act must cause damage of a type that would have been foreseen by a reasonable physician.",,A,
Q7,which of the following poison can be found even in skeletonised remains of the body?,"a)Arsenic
b)carbon monoxide
c)Hydrogen sulphide
d)phosphorus","Arsenic can be found even in skeletonized remains of the body.
It becomes fixed in the cancellous tissues of the long bones by the conversion of phosphates to
arsenates. The elimination of arsenic in this form is much slower and can be detected in the bones for several years after death.
Heavy metals such as lead, copper, mercury, including metalloids like arsenic and antimony, may  be found in bones for a prolonged period in cases of chronic poisoning. They are also deposited in hair, nails, etc. For these reasons, when heavy metal poisoning is suspected, these specimens are   collected in addition to the routine viscera and body fluids.",,A,
Q8,A child who is a victim under pocso act is brought to the department of forensic medicine    for age estimation. The X-ray image of the hand is shown below. what is the likely age of the child?,"a)4 years
b)7 years
c)1o years
d)13 years","The child's age is likely to be 13 years.
In the given X-ray image of the wrist and hand, all the carpal bones are seen. The lower epiphysis of the first metacarpal has not united with the shaft. This suggests that the age of the child is
between 8 to 15 years.
Additionally, the presence of the hook of the hamate in the radiograph suggests that the age is between 13-14 years.
