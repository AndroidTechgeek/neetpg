Q1,Match the following intracranial bleed:,"a)A -i B-ii C- iii D- iv
b)A -ii B-iv C-i D-iii
c)A-iv B-iii C -ii D-i
d)A -iv B-ii C-iii D-i","Epidural hematoma:


Noncontrasted axial computed tomography scan showing a lenticular area of increased density in left parietal region.
• Typically occur in the groove of the middle meningeal artery associated with temporal bone fractures that have resulted in a tear of middle meningeal artery.
• They tend to not to cross suture lines of the skull.
subdural hematoma:


A non contrasted computed tomography scan of acute subdural hematoma shows a cresentric area of increased density in the right posterior parietal region between brain and the skull. An area of   intraparenchymal haemorrhage also seen. In addition, mass effect causes a midline shift to left.
• They can cross suture lines but they do not cross the tentorium or falx.
• can be acute or chronic



Subarachnoid haemorrhage:


A non contrasted axial computed tomography scan shows the blood as areas of increased density near the base of the brain shows blood in Texaco star pattern formed blood radiating from
suprasellar cistern into the sylvian fissures and anterior interhemispheric fissure.
• Most often accompanied by severe sudden onset headache.
• Can really be visualised in acute stage, when blood is radiographically dense (whiter) than the CSF.
Intracereberal haemorrhage:


Non contrast computed tomography shows a large area of fresh blood appearing white in the region of right thalamus. Blood is denser than CSF so settles dependently.
This settling is not seen with subarachnoid or interparenchymal blood.",3923-2475.PNG,B,3928-2482.PNG;3928-2481.PNG;3929-2484.PNG;3929-2483.PNG
Q2,The following appearance in IVP is caused by:,"a)Horse shoe kidney
b)ureterocoele
c)Bladder tumour
d)posterior urethral valve","The given intravenous pyelography (IVP) depicts the cobra head or adder head deformity or
spring onion sign seen in bilateral ureterocele. These signs refer to a dilated, contrast-filled distal ureter surrounded by a thin rim ofthe ureteric wall and bladder mucosa.
ureterocoele is a cystic enlargement of the intramural portion of the ureter, more commonly seen  in females than males. It is thought to be caused due to ureteric orifice atresia. They are similar to ectopic ureters, which typically drain the upper pole of the kidney and are associated with
dysplastic or non-functional renal tissue.
If they present clinically, ureteroceles often manifest with urinary tract infections (uTIs) in children, while in adults, they are more likely to present with stones in the lower ureter.
ureterocoeles can enlarge and obstruct the bladder neck or the contralateral ureteric orifice.
The classic sign of a ureterocele on intravenous urography is a ‘cobra head’, ‘adder head’, or
'spring onion sign'.  on ultrasonography, it can be seen as a fluid-filled cystic mass in the bladder. The treatment of simple ureteroceles is surgical excision with re-implantation of the ureter.",3924-2477.PNG,B,
Q3,which of the following investigations is shown in the radiograph?,"a)Barium swallow
b)Barium meal
c)Barium meal follow through
d)Barium enema","The given image is a double-contrast radiograph of a barium meal. It is used to examine the lower half of the esophagus, stomach, and entire duodenum. It is used in identifying ulcers, small fleshy lumps (polyps), tumours.
Barium meal follow-through is useful in visualising small bowel pathology and evaluating the
function of the small bowel. It is performed following a barium meal examination where X-rays are taken 1o-15 minutes after the intake of barium. This allows time for the barium to reach the small intestine. It is inferior to enteroclysis enema, where contrast is administered through a
nasogastric tube.

GI Imaging	Preparations of bariu m	structures best visualized
Barium swallow	Barium paste	Esophagus
Barium meal	95% Baso4	stomach and duodenum
Barium meal follow-throu gh	5o% Baso4	small bowel
Barium enema	25% Baso4	Large bowel

The below radiograph is a double-contrast barium enema with a normal large bowel structure. The contrast is administered through a rectal tube and a series of radiographs are obtained.",3924-2476.PNG,B,3931-2486.PNG
Q4,what is the best imaging study for earliest diagnosis of cerebral infarct?,"a)FLAIR MRI
b)Non-contrast CT
c)CECT
d)Diffusion weighted MRI","The best imaging modality for the early diagnosis of cerebral infarction is diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), which can detect infarcts as early as 3o minutes of onset and identify cytotoxic oedema
within a few hours of ischemic stroke.
However, the initial investigation in suspected stroke cases is non-contrast CT due to its rapid acquisition time, widespread availability, and cost-effectiveness. It helps quickly rule out
hemorrhagic stroke and facilitates the timely administration of intravenous tpA in eligible patients.
Acute MCA territory infarct on CT is shown below:


The image below is of a DWI MRI of a patient clearly showing the extent ofthe infarct.",,D,3931-2485.PNG;3932-2487.PNG
Q5,"During evaluation of Puo, a patient's chest X-ray is as seen below. what is your diagnosis?","a)Miliary tuberculosis
b)Pulmonary edema
c)Necrobiotic nodules
d)Tuberculoma","The given chest radiography image shows miliary tuberculosis.
It is the widespread dissemination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, via hematogenous spread.
classic miliary TB is defined as millet-like (mean, 2 mm; range, 1-5 mm) seeding of TB bacilli with uniform size and distribution in the lung, as seen on chest radiography. This particular sign is
called the miliary shadow which is also seen in sarcoidosis and histoplasmosis.
sputum-smear microscopy is negative in most cases.
physical findings include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy
Bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy are used to provide bacteriologic confirmation",3925-2478.PNG,A,
Q6,Identify the structure marked in the following MRI scan:,"a)Midbrain
b)cerebellum
c)Brainstem
d)cerebrum","The given image shows an MRI of the sagittal section of the brain. The area marked with a red arrow is the cerebellum.
The other areas also visualized in the image are :",3926-2479.PNG,B,3933-2488.PNG
Q7,which of the following is a water soluble contrast?,"a)Iohexol
b)Barium
c)Bromium
d)calcium","Iohexol is a nonionic, water-soluble radiographic contrast medium.
It is used to visualize the following structres:
• Arteries
• veins
• ventricles of the brain
• The urinary system
• Joints
It can be used during computer tomography (cT scan) as well. It can be given orally,
intravenously, or can be injected into the body cavity.",,A,
Q8,All of the following could be the cause of the following X-ray finding except:,"a)Duodenal ulcer perforation
b)post laparoscopy
c)chilaiditi syndrome
d)Acute intestinal obstruction","The given X-ray shows air under the diaphragm, indicative of pneumoperitoneum, which is not caused by acute intestinal obstruction.
causes of pneumoperitoneum include:
• Bowel perforation: Gastric and posterior duodenal perforations in long-standing cases of peptic ulcers., ischemic bowel, necrotizing enterocolitis
• small bowel perforation secondary to trauma or penetrating injuries
• post-surgery/laparoscopy
• causes other than perforation are:



• chilaiditi syndrome - the intestine is seen between the liver and diaphragm giving a false impression of free air
• sub-phrenic abscess
• postoperatively, air may be present in the abdomen for up to 7 days
An intestinal obstruction would show multiple dilated loops on X-ray with possible air-fluid levels. only when the obstruction becomes severe and there is a perforation, pneumoperitoneum occurs.
The image given below is an abdominal radiograph showing multiple dilated loops with air-fluid levels suggestive of intestinal obstruction.",3927-2480.PNG,D,3934-2489.PNG
