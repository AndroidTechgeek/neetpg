Q1,"A patient in emergency has the following lab parameters: creatinine 1.5 and BUN 45. The    chest x-ray is shown below. In gram staining and culture, only rhinovirus was isolated. The patient is shifted to ICU. what is the treatment of choice in this patient?","a)Azithromycin
b)Ceftriaxone plus azithromycin
c)Amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid
d)piptaz plus ciprofloxacin","The chest radiograph is suggestive of pneumonia. Since this patient requires treatment in an ICU setting, the drugs of choice would be ceftriaxone plus azithromycin.
Initial treatment in inpatients with pneumonia:
Appropriate antibiotics for pseudomonas aeruginosa or MRSA are to be added if there is a history of prior isolation from respiratory samples.

Non-severe disea se	A β-lactam + a macrolide (cef triaxone + azithromycin)orA   respiratory fluoroquinolone
Severe disease	A β-lactam + a macrolide (cef triaxone + azithromycin)orA   β-lactam + respiratory fluoro  quinolone",4488-2826.PNG,B,
Q2,A patient presents with severe vomiting and diarrhea and has orthostatic hypotension. what metabolic abnormalities would you expect in this patient?,"a)2, 4 only
b)1, 3 only
c)1, 2, 3, 4
d)1, 2, 3","In the given clinical scenario, the patient is likely to have hypokalemia, hypochloremia and metabolic alkalosis.
The given clinical scenario describes a patient who has a history of vomiting and diarrhea and now has orthostatic hypotension. This indicates that the patient is dehydrated and there is a    contraction of the extracellular fluid volume. This would stimulate the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).
Elevated aldosterone causes net H+ and K+ excretion from the distal tubule of the kidneys. This causes hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Alkalosis is worsened because angiotensin II
stimulates the Na+-H+ exchanger in the renal proximal convoluted tubule and increases the
reabsorption of Na+ and HCO3-. Hypochloremia occurs because of loss of HCl during vomiting, and is maintained due to loss of Cl- in the kidney which accompanies increased HCO3-
reabsorption.
In a patient with metabolic alkalosis, the compensatory mechanism should be respiratory
acidosis, not respiratory alkalosis (statement 4). This occurs in the form of hypoventilation, which increases paCO2.",,D,
Q3,order in which the following heart sounds are heard from superior to inferior on the left side chest wall?,"a)3 → 1 → 2
b)3 → 2 → 1
c)2 → 1 → 3
d)1 → 2 → 3","The order of heart sounds as they are heard on the left chest wall from superior to inferior is as follows:
• pulmonary — second intercostal space
• Aortic — can be auscultated in the neoaortic area or the Erb's point, in the third intercostal space
• Mitral — fifth intercostal space
The following picture shows the areas of auscultation:


• Aortic area, second right intercostal space: this area is primarily used for auscultation of the     aortic valve. The murmurs heard best here are those of aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
• pulmonic area, second left intercostal space: this area is primarily used for the auscultation of the pulmonic valve.
• Erb's point, third left intercostal space: this area lies close to both the semilunar valves.
pathologies of both aortic and pulmonic valves can be heard at this point. Murmurs in this region are more audible if the patient leans forward.
• Tricuspid area, fourth left intercostal space: murmurs of tricuspid stenosis and tricuspid regurgitation, and ventricular septal defects are heard in this area.
• Mitral area, fifth left intercostal space in the midclavicular line: murmurs of mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and mitral valve prolapse are heard here.",,D,4504-2834.PNG
Q4,"A 35-year-old female presents with skin thickening, muscle weakness, and the peripheries
becoming pale on exposure to cold. she is positive for ANA and anti-scl-7o antibodies. Her   creatinine kinase is elevated and muscle biopsy shows perifascicular infiltration. what is the antibody associated with this?","a)Anti-U3 RNP
b)Anti-centromere antibody
c)Anti-PM-scl antibody
d)Anti-Jo-1 antibody","The given patient with a history and findings suggestive of diffuse systemic sclerosis and
dermatomyositis/polymyositis is most likely to be suffering from overlap syndrome. The presence of skin thickening, Reynaud's phenomenon, and anti-scl-7o antibodies are suggestive of diffuse     systemic sclerosis, while muscle weakness and perifascicular infiltration are suggestive of



dermatomyositis/polymyositis.
In overlap syndromes involving polymyositis/dermatomyositis and systemic sclerosis, anti-PM-Scl antibodies are found in close to 5o% of the patients, while anti-Jo-1 antibodies were found to be    positive in 2o-3o% of the patients.
Anti-centromere antibodies (option B) are seen in limited-cutaneous systemic sclerosis. Anti-U3-RNP antibodies (also known as anti-fibrillin antibodies) are seen in both
limited-cutaneous and diffuse systemic sclerosis. They signify an increased risk of the patient   developing pulmonary arterial hypertension, interstitial lung disease, scleroderma renal crisis, and myositis.",,C,
Q5,During which phase of the cardiac cycle is an AR murmur likely to be heard?,"a)ventricular ejection
b)Throughout cardiac cycle
c)Isovolumetric contraction
d)ventricular diastole","Aortic regurgitation (AR) murmur is most likely to be heard during the ventricular diastole.
on auscultation of patients with chronic AR, a high-pitched decrescendo diastolic murmur is
heard. It can be best noted in the third intercostal space on the left sternal border. In patients
with mild AR, the murmur is brief. But as the disease progresses, it becomes longer in duration,   and can indeed become holodiastolic. In patients in whom AR is due to primary valvular disease,  the diastolic murmur is heard louder on the left sternal border. However, if the murmur is louder on the right sternal border, it indicates that AR is due to aneurysmal dilation of the aortic root.
The auscultatory features ofAR are intensified by handgrip, which augments systemic vascular resistance and increases LV afterload.
The heart murmurs heard in systole are:
• Aortic and pulmonic stenosis: ejection systolic murmur
• Chronic mitral and tricuspid regurgitation: holosystolic murmur
• Mitral valve prolapse: midsystolic click followed by a late systolic murmur
• Ventricular septal defect: holosystolic murmur The heart murmurs heard in diastole are:
• Aortic regurgitation: early diastolic, decrescendo murmur
• Mitral stenosis: opening snap following by mid to late diastolic murmur",,D,
Q6,Identify the given ECG.,"a)Torsades de pointes
b)ventricular fibrillation
c)Atrial flutter
d)Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia","The given ECG shows broad QRS tachycardia with changing QRS morphology with every beat. The most likely diagnosis in this case is polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or Torsades de
pointes.
The causes of torsades de pointes include congenital long QT syndrome, electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia), certain drugs, cardiac conditions like
myocardial infarction and myocarditis, and endocrine disorders like hypothyroidism and pheochromocytoma.



other options:
ventricular fibrillation (option B) shows a completely disorganized rhythm with no identifiable waves on ECG, as shown in the image below.


Atrial flutter (option C) shows sawtooth appearance of the P-waves. This is due to rapid and
successive atrial depolarization. The arrhythmia usually originates in the area of the tricuspid
annulus in the right atrium. The ECG given below depicts atrial flutter, with the sawtooth P-waves most apparent in leads v1 and v2.


Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (option D) shows wide QRS complex tachycardia but with    the same QRS morphology in each beat. It occurs most commonly due to structural heart diseases (cardiomyopathy, or scarring after myocardial infarction). The patients are at high risk for sudden cardiac death. The ECG given below shows monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.",4490-2827.PNG,A,4506-2835-1.png;4506-2835.PNG;4507-2836.PNG
Q7,Total plasma exchange is done in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. How does TPE help in the management ofTTP?,"a)TPE removes the von willebrand factor
b)TPE removes the antiplatelet antibodies
c)TPE replenishes the coagulation factors
d)TPE removes anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies and thereby increases the ADAMTS protease activity","Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) removes autoantibodies to ADAMTS13. This makes
ADAMTS13 enzyme functional and it is able to degrade multimers of von Willebrand factor.
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is thrombotic microangiopathy that can be
inherited or spontaneously acquired. It results from a deficiency of or antibodies to the
metalloprotease ADAMTS13, which normally cleaves multimers of vWF. Failure to cleave these
multimers results in excessive platelet adhesion and aggregation. This causes platelet thrombi and fibrin deposits to form at various sites in the circulation. These thrombi result in the classic
pentad of clinical features:
• Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA)
• Thrombocytopenia
• Renal failure
• Neurologic findings
• Fever
The platelet thrombi narrow the vessel lumen, causing shearing stress on the red blood cells that are passing through. This results in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The same platelet
thrombi cause microvascular occlusion and result in features like renal failure and neurological     manifestations. on peripheral smear, these fragmented red cells appear as schistocytes or helmet cells, as shown in the image below:





The mainstay of treatment of TTP is with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). TPE is continued till the platelet count becomes normal and signs of hemolysis are absent for at least 2 days.
Glucocorticoids have been used as an adjunct to TPE. Addition of rituximab as an initial therapy also decreases the duration of TTP and relapses.",,D,4508-2837.PNG
Q8,Identify the neurological test being performed.,"a)Babinski sign
b)Ankle jerk
c)Jendrassik
d)Normal plantar response","The image shows extensor plantar response, which is a positive Babinski sign.
The normal response to uncomfortable or painful cutaneous stimulation of the file of the foot
includes plantar flexion of the toes. This can be accompanied by flexion withdrawal of the limb. If there is an upper motor neuron lesion affecting the leg being tested, there will be an extensor
plantar response, which is a positive Babinski sign. The minimum extensor response to be looked for is at least the extension of the great toe. It can be accompanied by fanning of other tows and    contraction of the tensor fascia lata. other features which may be seen in UMN lesions are
spasticity of the leg, pathologically brisk reflexes, and ankle clonus.
The below image shows the positive and negative Babinski signs.





The image below shows a positive Babinski sign in an adult, which is abnormal and indicative of a UMN lesion.


In infants whose corticospinal tracts are still underdeveloped, dorsiflexion of the great toe and    fanning of other toes is a normal response to scratching of the sole of the foot. The image below shows an extensor response in an infant, which is normal.",4491-2828.PNG,A,4408-2781.PNG;4404-2777-1.png;4409-2782.PNG
Q9,which among the following indicates severe COVID?,"a)RR &gt;24/min
b)MAP 7o mmHg
c)Lung infiltrates &gt;42% on CT
d)SpO2 &lt; 85% on room air","spO2 &lt; 9o% on room air indicates severe COVID.
According to the clinical guidelines for the management of COVID-19 patients released by the
AIIMs/ICMR task force, a respiratory rate of &gt;24/min constitutes moderate COVID, not severe COVID.

Q10,which of the following are seen in iron deficiency anemia?,"a)1, 2
b)3, 4
c)1, 2, 3, 4
d)1, 3, 4","Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is characterized by reduced serum iron level, reduced transferrin saturation, increased total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and reduced ferritin level.
serum iron level represents the amount of circulating iron bound to transferrin. when the iron stores become depleted in IDA, the serum iron level begins to fall.
TIBC is an indirect measure of the circulating levels of the iron-transporting protein, transferrin. IDA is characterized by more free transferrin (not bound to iron) available in circulation. This
increases the TIBC. Transferrin saturation is calculated as: (serum iron ÷ TIBC) x 1oo. Normal
transferrin saturation is 25-5o%. Iron deficiency states show low transferrin saturation. A
transferrin saturation &gt;5o% indicates a large amount of iron being delivered to the tissues, and can cause tissue iron overload. This is seen in hemochromatosis.
serum ferritin is the most useful laboratory test to assess the levels of iron stores in the body. As iron stores are depleted, serum ferritin levels fall. Levels &lt;15 μg/L are diagnostic of completely absent iron stores.",,C,
Q11,A patient recovered from hepatitis B infection. which of the following curve represents antibodies seen 4 weeks post-recovery?,"a)Anti-HBs
b)Anti-HBc
c)HBeAg
d)HBsAg","The serological marker marked in the image is anti-HBs antibody. In typical cases of resolving hepatitis B, HBsAg becomes undetectable 1-2 months after the appearance of clinical features.
After this, anti-HBs becomes detectable in the serum.
After a person is infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), the first serologic marker to increase in level is HBsAg. It becomes detectable in the serum between 1-12 weeks. It becomes undetectable    1–2 months after the onset of jaundice and rarely persists beyond 6 months. once the HBsAg
becomes undetectable, anti-HBs antibody starts rising in serum and remains detectable
indefinitely thereafter. The gap between the disappearance of HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs antibodies is called the window period.
HBcAg is located inside the cells and is usually enclosed within an HBsAg coat when present in
the serum. As a result, HBcAg is not commonly detectable in the serum of patients with HBV
infection since naked core particles are not found in the bloodstream. conversely, anti-HBc can be detected in the serum shortly after the emergence of HBsAg, usually within 1-2 weeks.
Anti-HBc may be the only serologic marker useful for the identification of HBV infection during the window period.
HBeAg appears shortly after the appearance of HBsAg. Its appearance correlates with high levels of virus replication. Anti-HBe correlates with a period of lower infectivity.",4492-2829.PNG,A,4512-2839.PNG
Q12,which of the following is not a cause of reversible dementia?,"a)B12 deficiency
b)Normal pressure hydrocephalus
c)Lewy body dementia
d)Hypothyroidism","Lewy body dementia causes irreversible dementia.
Dementia is an acquired deterioration in cognitive abilities that impairs the successful
performance of activities of daily living. The most commonly lost cognitive function is episodic memory, that is, the ability to recall events specific in time and place.
causes of dementia are:
Reversible



• Hypothyroidism
• Thiamine deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency
• Normal pressure hydrocephalus
• Subdural hematoma
• Brain tumor
• chronic infection
• Autoimmune encephalopathy
Irreversible
• Alzheimer's disease
• Huntington's disease
• Lewy body dementia
• vascular dementia
• creutzfeld-Jacob disease
• Frontotemporal dementia
• parkinson's disease",,C,
Q13,"A female presented with excessive daytime sleepiness and impaired concentration and
memory for one year. on examination, the BMI was 43 kg/m2 and BP was 17o/98 mmHg.     ABG was done in awake state and the findings are given below. which of the following is the likely diagnosis?","a)obesity hypoventilation syndrome
b)obstructive sleep apnea
c)central sleep apnea
d)Narcolepsy","The given clinical scenario of an obese patient with daytime sleepiness and hypercapnia on ABG is suggestive of obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) occurs due to increased work of breathing, respiratory muscle impairment related to the increased load, and depressed central ventilatory response to   hypoxemia and hypercapnia. The diagnosis of OHS requires:
• BMI ≥3o kg/m2
• pacO2 ≥45 mmHg which signifies daytime alveolar hypoventilation
• Evidence of sleep-disordered breathing, which in most cases is due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (option B) is diagnosed if the patient has either symptoms of
nocturnal breathing disturbances or daytime sleepiness, and ≥5 episodes of obstructive apnea or hypopnea per hour of sleep. Each such episode should last for at least 1o seconds, resulting
in ≥3% drop in oxygen saturation or a brain cortical arousal. OSA is diagnosed by overnight
polysomnogram (pSG). This includes measurement of breathing, oxygenation, body position,
cardiac rhythm, sleep stages, and snoring intensity. waking hypoxemia or hypercarbia in a patient with OSA suggests cardiopulmonary disease or obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
central sleep apnea (cSA) (option c) is caused due to increased sensitivity to pcO2. This causes an unstable breathing pattern which manifests as hyperventilation alternating with apnea.
prolonged circulation delay between pulmonary capillaries and carotid chemoreceptors is also a contributing cause. Hence, patients with heart failure may show cSA. They can present with



cheyne-stokes breathing.
Narcolepsy (option D) presents with difficulty sustaining wakefulness and disturbed nocturnal
sleep. However, unlike sleep apnea, patients with narcolepsy usually feel well-rested on
awakening and then feel tired throughout the day. one of the most characteristic clinical features which is seen is cataplexy – sudden muscle weakness without a loss of consciousness, which is
usually triggered by strong emotions.",,A,
Q14,A patient with chronic kidney disease has the following laboratory reports. calculate the anion gap in this patient.,"a)25
b)68
c)35
d)43","The anion gap in this patient is 35 mEq/L.
The anion gap is calculated as Na+ – [cl- + Hco3-]. In this patient, the anion gap will be calculated as: 145 – (9o + 2o) 〓 145 – 11o 〓 35 mEq/L.
Anion gap is representative of unmeasured anions which are normally present in the plasma, such as anionic proteins (albumin), phosphate, sulfate, and organic anions. when acid anions such as    acetoacetate and lactate accumulate in the extracellular fluid, the anion gap increases, causing a
high anion gap metabolic acidosis. A decrease in anion gap can occur due to an increase in
abnormal cations (such as lithium, immunoglobulins), reduction in plasma albumin (nephrotic syndrome) or hyperviscosity and hyperlipidemia.",,C,
Q15,"A person comes to the oPD with symptoms of not using his left side and not washing the left side of his body while bathing. on examination, he wasn't able to draw the left side of the
images. which of the following is the most likely location of the lesion?","a)Left motor cortex
b)Left posterior parietal area
c)Right posterior parietal area
d)Right motor cortex","The given presentation and image suggest hemispatial neglect on the left side. This is likely due to a contralateral (right) parietal lobe lesion.
The right hemisphere of the brain directs attention within the entire extrapersonal space – both
right and left side. If there is a lesion in the left hemisphere, there is not much contralesional
neglect because the right hemisphere can compensate for both sides. The left hemisphere directs    attention only in the contralateral right hemispace. If there is a lesion in the right hemisphere, it    leads to severe contralesional hemineglect because the left hemisphere does not contain ipsilateral attention functions.
patients with neglect may not be able to dress or groom the left side of the body. They may fail to copy the details on the left side of a drawing. Two bedside tests can be used to evaluate neglect:
• In simultaneous bilateral stimulation, when the examiner provides unilateral or simultaneous bilateral stimulation in the visual, auditory, or tactile modalities, patients have no difficulty
detecting unilateral stimuli on either side but perceive the bilaterally presented stimulus as coming only from one side. This phenomenon is known as extinction.
• In visual target cancellation, the patient fails to detect the targets on one-half of the field in target-detection tasks.
other features of non-dominant pareital lobe lesions include:
• constructional apraxia
• visuo-spatial disorientation



• Dressing apraxia",4493-2830.PNG,C,
Q16,Identify the type of ANA staining pattern shown in the image below.,"a)centromeric
b)Homogenous
c)Nucleolar
d)speckled","The given picture shows discrete and large speckles in the resting cells, and the alignment of the   speckles in the chromosome region in the dividing cells. This is suggestive of centromeric pattern of ANA staining. Centromeric pattern is seen in limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (CREST
syndrome).
The main patterns of ANA staining are as follows:
Homogenous pattern refers to diffuse staining of the nucleus in the resting cells. There is also
staining of the chromosome region in the dividing cells. The usual antibodies which show this
pattern are anti-histone antibodies and anti-dsDNA antibodies. This type of pattern is also seen in chronic autoimmune hepatitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Homogenous staining is shown in  the image below.


Fine speckled pattern refers to hundreds of dots present throughout the nucleus. However, there is no staining of the chromosome region of the dividing cells as shown in the image below. This   pattern is shown by anti-SS-A/Ro and anti-SS-B/La antibodies.





Coarse speckled pattern refers to hundreds of dots present in the nucleus, but generally larger than the dots seen in fine speckled pattern. There is no staining of nucleoli or dividing
chromosomes. This type of pattern is seen in anti-sm and anti-U1 RNP antibodies.
Dense fine speckled pattern shows the speckles distributed throughout the nucleoli. This pattern differs from the fine and coarse speckled patterns in that the speckles are associated with the
chromosomes in the dividing cells. This type of pattern is not associated with systemic rheumatic disease.",4494-2831.PNG,A,4515-2840.PNG;4516-2842.PNG;4516-2841.PNG
Q17,A chronic cigarette smoker now joined a construction company. His pulmonary function test results are given below. what is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?,"a)vascular disease with bronchodilator reversibility
b)Restrictive lung disease with bronchodilator reversibility
c)Restrictive lung disease without bronchodilator reversibility
d)obstructive disease with bronchodilator reversibility","In the given clinical scenario, FEV1/FVC is less than o.7, hence it is obstructive. After
bronchodilation, FEV1 has increased from o.9L to 1.9L, which is more than 12% implying its reversible. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is an obstructive disease with bronchodilator



reversibility.
In obstructive pulmonary disease, FEV1/FVC is reduced to &lt;o.7 and FEV1 is also reduced
&lt;8o%. Reversibility is defined as a ≥12% increase and absolute increase of 2oomL in the FEV1 at least 15 min after administration of a β2 -agonist. Examples of obstructive pulmonary disease   include COpD, asthma, bronchiectasis, etc.
In restrictive pulmonary disease, FEV1/FVC is normal or increased ( &gt;o.7) and FEV1 and FVC are also reduced. Examples of restrictive pulmonary disease include asbestosis, sarcoidosis,
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, etc.",,D,
Q18,which of the following are true about subclinical myocarditis?,"a)1, 2
b)3, 4
c)1, 2, 3, 4, 5
d)2, 3, 4, 5","A patient is diagnosed with possible subclinical acute myocarditis when there is a typical
syndrome but without any cardiac symptoms such as palpitations. Biomarkers of cardiac injury are elevated (statement 2), ECG is abnormal (statement 4), and there is a reduced LV ejection    fraction (statement 5) and regional wall motion abnormality on 2D echo (statement 3).
probable acute myocarditis is diagnosed when the aforementioned criteria are accompanied by
cardiac symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, and chest pain. when there are signs of pericarditis along with elevated Ck-MB or troponins and regional wall motion abnormalities,    the term myopericarditis or perimyocarditis is used.
Definite myocarditis is diagnosed when there is histological evidence of inflammation on endomyocardial biopsy, and does not require any other laboratory or clinical criteria.",,D,
Q19,A female with nephrotic syndrome underwent a renal biopsy. which of the following statements is not correct?,"a)1, 2, 3, 4
b)4
c)1, 4
d)2, 3, 4","patients undergoing a percutaneous kidney biopsy are observed for a 24-hour period (statement  2) in the hospital. If any major complication occurs, it is likely to happen during this period, and thus likely to be identified and treated early. Bleeding and hematoma formation are relatively
common complications of kidney biopsy and can present as frank hematuria or dark red clots in the urine (statement 3).
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a pathological diagnosis, so obtaining a tissue
sample from kidney biopsy is necessary (statement 1). On light microscopy, there are focal
(affecting only some of the glomeruli) and segmental (affecting only part of the glomerulus)
lesions. There is a collapse of capillary loops, an increase in the matrix, and deposition of plasma proteins.
In patients with features of systemic amyloidosis (statement 4), rectal or gingival tissues can be biopsied for the confirmation of the diagnosis. Examination of abdominal fat pat aspirates can  also be used for confirmation of systemic amyloidosis.",,C,
Q20,which of the following will not be measured to diagnose metabolic syndrome?,"a)HDL levels
b)Hip circumference
c)Blood glucose
d)Blood pressure","Hip circumference is not used in the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. waist circumference is the parameter used.
Metabolic syndrome is present if three or more of the following five criteria are met, as defined by National Cholesterol Education Program and Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III):
• Central obesity: waist circumference of &gt;1o2 cm in males and &gt;88 cm in females
• Hypertriglyceridemia: Triglyceride level of ≥ 15o mg/dL
• Low HDL cholesterol: &lt;4o mg/dL and &lt;5o mg/dL for men and women, respectively
• Hypertension: systolic BP of ≥13o mmHg or diastolic BP of ≥ 85 mmHg
• Fasting plasma glucose level: ≥1oo mg/dL or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes
BMI and LDL cholesterol levels are not part of NCEP-ATP III.
Metabolic syndrome (syndrome X) is a group of conditions that increases the risk for
cardiovascular disease. These include hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia,
and central obesity. Increasing age, genetics, and sedentary lifestyle are considered risk factors.
Insulin resistance is the most accepted hypothesis used to explain the pathophysiology of the    condition. Elevated circulating fatty acids are considered a major factor in developing insulin   resistance. It is associated with acanthosis nigricans which are velvety hyperpigmented lesions in skin flexures such as the axilla, groin, and back of the neck.",,B,
Q21,"An old man presents with dyspnea and swelling of his feet. on examination, rales are heard     and he is found to have an enlarged heart on chest x-ray. which of the following will delay the progression?","a)Furosemide
b)carvedilol
c)Digoxin
d)captopril","The given scenario is suggestive of heart failure. ACE inhibitors like captopril are the first-line drugs to prevent further cardiac remodeling and prevent the progression of disease.
Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome that occurs because the ventricle is unable to fill with
or eject blood. The important etiologies of heart failure include hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, high output states, such as beriberi, thyrotoxicosis, and severe anemia.
Clinical features of heart failure include dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, pedal edema, anorexia, pallor, elevated JVP, ascites, and hepatomegaly.
Heart failure is classified based on the ejection fraction:
• Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) - left ventricular ejection fraction is ≥5o%
• Heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmEF) - left ventricular ejection fraction 4o-5o%
• Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) - left ventricular ejection fraction is ≤4o% The mainstay management of heart failure is medical therapy and device therapy is reserved for refractory cases. The type of medications used in medical therapy are:
• Drugs with symptomatic and mortality benefits provide symptomatic relief and reduce mortality risk by preventing cardiac remodeling. It includes -
• Angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) - a combination of sacubitril and valsartan



• Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors - ramipril, enalapril
• β-blockers - metoprolol, carvedilol, bisoprolol
• Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist - spironolactone, eplerenone
• Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitor) - dapagliflozin
• Drugs with only symptomatic benefits provide only symptomatic relief and have no effect on reducing mortality risk. It includes -
• Loop diuretics - furosemide
• Digoxin
unfortunately, evidence of the clinical benefits of most therapies is restricted to HFrEF.
pharmacological therapy used in HFpEF is mainly diuretics.
Non-pharmacological therapy includes implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), cardiac
resynchronization using biventricular pacing, etc. These treatments are not found to be effective in HFpEF.",,D,
Q22,"A 27-year-old female patient presents with weight loss, anxiety, tachycardia, and restlessness. The resting pulse was 11o beats per minute. which of the following tests should be done to
evaluate her condition further?","a)Total T3
b)TPO
c)Thyroid Scan
d)TSH and free T4","This patient is presenting with symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The next step in diagnosis would be to obtain a serum TSH level and Free T4 level.
Investigations in a patient with Graves' disease
• Thyroid function tests- In Graves disease, the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are   decreased with or without elevated T3 and T4 levels. It is the first step in evaluating suspected thyroid disease.
• Anti-thyroid antibodies- Elevated levels of TSH receptor antibodies are diagnostic of Graves' disease. Other antibodies like anti-Tg and anti-TpO are elevated in most of the patients.
• ultrasound of the neck is performed to evaluate vascularity, echogenicity, nodules, and clinical landmarks for surgical planning.
• CT or MRI scans of the orbits are useful to evaluate Graves’ ophthalmopathy.
The hyperthyroidism of Graves’ disease is caused by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin
(TSI) that are synthesized in the thyroid gland as well as in bone marrow and lymph nodes. TSI antibodies cause stimulation of the thyroid gland causing features of hyperthyroidism in the
presence of low TSH levels. Histopathology shows follicular and papillary hyperplasia with lymphoid infiltration.
A patient with Graves' disease will present with complaints of:
• Hyperactivity, irritability
• Heat intolerance and sweating
• palpitations
• weakness
• weight loss with increased appetite



• Diarrhea
• Polyuria, oligomenorrhea, and loss of libido.
on examination, they may have
• Tachycardia

Q23,"A 65-year-old man was brought after a fall. He has a fever and confusion. On examination, he had a cough with rales. The patient was also tachypneic. How will you manage this patient?","a)Admit and give Oral levofloxacin
b)Treat at home and oral augmentin
c)Admit and iv ceftriaxone
d)Admit and give Iv levofloxacin","The given clinical scenario of a patient with fever and productive cough point to a diagnosis of
pneumonia. Since this patient's CURB-65 score is at least 3 (1 point each for confusion,
tachyapnea, and Age 65), the most appropriate management would be ICU admission and starting IV antibiotics. This patient with a score of 3 will need ICU admission and treatment with a
respiratory quinolone like levofloxacin.
once the diagnosis of pneumonia is made, the next step in management is to determine the site of care for the patient. To identify the patients that require in-patient and ICU management,
CURB-65 score is used. It includes:
• Confusion
• Urea ≥ 2o mg/dL
• Respiratory rate ≥3o/min
• Blood pressure: SBP ≤9ommHg or DBP ≤6o mmHg
• Age ≥ 65 years
1 point is given for the presence of each of the above. The total score determines the site of care, as shown below:
Note: Treatment with a combination of Beta-lactam and a macrolide or a respiratory
fluoroquinolone alone results in lower mortality than monotherapy with a beta-lactam antibiotic. Therefore, out of the given options, D is the best answer.

Q24,"A 6o-year-old with a history of COPD is brought to the ER with worsening dyspnea. ABG was done and pH was 7.3, pCO2 was 6ommHg with HCO3- being 28 mEq/L. which of the
following is seen in this patient?","a)Respiratory acidosis, hyperventilation, inadequate metabolic compensation
b)Respiratory alkalosis, hypoventilation, inadequate metabolic compensation
c)Respiratory acidosis, hypoventilation, inadequate metabolic compensation
d)Respiratory acidosis, hypoventilation, adequate metabolic compensation","The arterial blood gas values suggest a likely diagnosis of respiratory acidosis (pH of 7.3 and elevated paco2 of 6ommHg indicating inadequate respirations). Normal serum bicarbonate levels are 22-26mEq/L indicating that this patient's acidosis is inadequately compensated.
The various buffering systems present in the body maintain the systemic arterial pH between
7.35-7.45. The most common acid-base disorders are metabolic acidosis or alkalosis and respiratory acidosis or alkalosis.
Normal values in an arterial blood gas are as follows:
• pH: 7.35-7.45
•
paco2: 35-45 mmHg
•
Hco3: 22-26 mEq/L
•
pao2: 75-1oo mmHg
Respiratory changes (changes in pco2) promote a corresponding change in metabolic response  (changes in Hco3-) and vice versa as a compensatory mechanism. In general, pco2 and Hco3- move in the same direction for compensation in metabolic and respiratory acid-base disorders    respectively. A change in the two parameters in opposite directions points to a mixed acid-base   disturbance.
Respiratory acidosis can be secondary to severe pulmonary disease, respiratory muscle fatigue, or ventilatory control abnormalities. It is marked by an increase in paco2 and a decrease in pH. A    compensatory rise of Hco3- can also be seen.
A rapid rise in pco2 (acute hypercapnia) can present with dyspnea, confusion, and psychosis. It can be seen in severe asthma secondary to bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, or inhalational burns.
chronic hypercapnia causes sleep disorders, memory loss, and daytime somnolence. It is commonly seen in end-stage obstructive lung disease.
Acute respiratory acidosis may need tracheal intubation and assisted mechanical ventilation.
Rapid correction of hypercapnia should be avoided as it can trigger cardiac arrhythmias and
seizures. chronic respiratory acidosis is difficult to manage and improvement in lung function is the primary aim.",,C,4195-2679.PNG
Q25,"A 6o-year-old man presented with acute onset of chest pain radiating to the left arm and

b)4, 5
c)1, 2, 3, 4, 5
d)1, 2, 3, 4","while atorvastatin, aspirin, clopidogrel, and low molecular weight heparin all have a role in the management of a patient with NSTEMI, there is no role of alteplase.
Initial management of a patient with NSTEMI includes bed rest to decrease the load on the heart.  oxygen is administered only if the patient has hypoxemia (Spo2 &lt;9o%) or heart failure. Further management includes the following medical therapy:
Nitrates (such as nitroglycerine given sublingually) reduce the venous return to the heart, thus  reducing the cardiac output and the oxygen demand. Nitrates are contraindicated if the patient has hypotension.
β-blockers also reduce the myocardial oxygen demand predominantly by their negative
chronotropic effect. Diltiazem or verapamil are given to reduce the heart rate if the patient doesn't respond to β-blockers.
Morphine is given if the patient continues to have severe chest pain despite the administration of the abovementioned anti-ischemic drugs.
Antithrombotic therapy, which includes:
• Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2y12 blocker such as clopidogrel. DAPT is continued for a minimum of 3 months, but preferably for 12 months.
• Anticoagulants such as low molecular weight heparin and bivalirudin
clot formation and fibrinolysis is a dynamic process occurring in the coronary arteries.
Antithrombotic therapy is given to prevent new clot formation while fibrinolysis is occurring by intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms.
Statins, such as atorvastatin are started because they reduce the risk of recurrence of NSTEMI and stabilize the atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries.",,D,4420-2787.PNG
Q26,A patient with a history of consumption of 2-3 drinks per week comes with complaints of    right upper quadrant discomfort. He has grade 2 steatosis. His BMI was 29kg/m2 and AST and ALT levels were slightly elevated. what would you advise him?,"a)Lifestyle modification and vitamin E
b)ursodeoxycholic acid and lifestyle modification
c)Lifestyle modifications and weight loss
d)pioglitazone and lifestyle modifications","This patient with a history of consumption of 2-3 alcoholic drinks per week(acceptable limit is
&lt;5 per week for men)presents with right upper quadrant discomfort with a BMI of 29kg/m2 and slightly elevated AST and ALT most likely has nonalcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD). The first     line for management of this condition is to advise him on lifestyle modifications and vitamin E.
All the other options include drugs that are used off-label but are not FDA-approved for use in NAFLD.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with diabetes and obesity. The fatty     change may also be caused due to the effect of toxins (including certain medications), protein malnutrition, dyslipidemia, and anoxia. Bleomycin, methotrexate, doxycycline, and
l-Asparaginase are other drugs causing hepatic steatosis.
Most of the patients with NAFLD and NASH are asymptomatic. They are usually diagnosed
incidentally on routine blood work. Some patients with NASH can present with right upper
quadrant pain due to stretching of the liver capsule from hepatomegaly, or acanthosis nigricans due to insulin resistance or with signs like palmar erythema, spider telangiectasia, jaundice,
splenomegaly, and ascites if they have liver cirrhosis. Currently, a biopsy is the gold standard investigation to establish the diagnosis.
The current approach to NAFLD management focuses on treatment to avoid or decrease the risk factors for NASH (like obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and dyslipidemia). For      patients with morbid obesity, bariatric surgery can be done. In patients with decompensated
cirrhosis, liver transplantation is can be considered.

b)Immune with recombinant HBV Vaccine
c)HBV infection in the remote past, completely recovered
d)chronic HBV infection - inactive carrier","The most probable diagnosis is remote infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV).
A non-reactive HbsAg rules out active HBV infection (options D).
Non-reactive IgM anti-HbcAg suggests that the patient is not in the window period (option A). The absence of Anti HbS makes vaccination unlikely.(option B)",,C,
Q28,The given image shows a normal graph on the left and the patient's graph on the right. which of the following diagnoses can be inferred from the graph?,"a)Chest wall neuromuscular disease
b)sarcoidosis
c)Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
d)Bronchiectasis","The patient’s graph shows a reduction in both FVC &amp; FEV1/FVC which is &lt; 7o%, indicating an obstructive lung disorder. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Bronchiectasis.
Chest neuromuscular disease (option A), sarcoidosis (option B) &amp; idiopathic pulmonary  fibrosis (option C) are restrictive lung disorders, where there is a reduction of FVC to &lt; 4L, without a loss in FEV1/FVC ratio (normal or &gt;7o%).
These values are measured as a part of the pulmonary function test known as spirometry. At a given lung volume, when a person inhales to the total lung capacity and exhales as hard and



completely as possible, the volume of expired air is recorded as forced vital capacity (FVC), and the volume of air expired in the first second is called the forced expiratory volume (FEV1).",4372-2762.PNG,D,

b)Third degree heart block
c)wenckeback heart block
d)Mobitz type 2 block","The ECG shown above shows regular PR intervals with a sudden dropped beat. This indicates a second-degree atrioventricular block, Mobitz type 2.
Second Degree Heart Block: It occurs due to the intermittent failure of electrical impulse
conduction from the atrium to the ventricle. It is characterized by a missed QRS. It is oftwo types:
• Mobitz type 1/wenckebach occurs due to the decremental conduction of electrical impulses in     the AV node. It is characterized by a progressive PR elongation leading to an eventual drop in the QRS complex. This may be seen in young athletes.


• Mobitz type 2 occurs in the distal or infra-His conduction system and is often associated with
intraventricular conduction delays. It is characterized by an intermittent failure of conduction of    the P wave without any change in the preceding impulses. on ECG there is a fixed PR interval and missed QRS.





other options:
option A: In a first-degree AV block, a prolonged PR interval (of over 2oo ms) is seen which
indicates a slowing of conduction between the atria and ventricles, usually due to slow conduction through the atrioventricular node (AV node).
option B: Third-degree heart block presents as a complete dissociation between the P wave and
the QRS complex and occurs due to complete blockage of transmission of impulses from the AV    node to the ventricles. Here, the ventricles assume an idioventricular rhythm and do not correlate to the P waves.",4499-2832.PNG,D,4390-2770.PNG;4390-2771.PNG

b)i, ii, iv, vi
c)i, ii, iii, iv
d)i, ii, iv, v","This patient presenting with increased thirst(polydipsia), increased urination(polyuria) and a random blood sugar of 205 makes a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus likely. For a newly
diagnosed case of diabetes, patients need to undergo other investigations to check for systemic progression of disease. These investigations include HbA1c, urine albumin creatinine ratio,
Fundoscopy, and ECG.
Diabetes can cause many microvascular and macrovascular complications and requires screening for these conditions.
• HbA1c is done to estimate the glycemic control over the last 3 months and helps guide further therapy. It should be done 2-4 times per year based on the previous values.
• urine albumin creatinine ratio is done to check if there is progression to diabetic kidney disease.
It should ideally be done annually to check for kidney disease.
• Dilated fundoscopy should be done annually in diabetics to rule out diabetic retinopathy. For a newly diagnosed case ofT2DM, fundoscopy should be done at the time of diagnosis and then
every year till there is no diabetic retinopathy.
• ECG should be done to check for resting electrolyte abnormalities in diabetics. Additionally, many diabetic patients also have co-existing hypertension so ECG is done to rule out left
ventricular hypertrophy.
• Testing for diabetic neuropathy should be done annually with the monofilament test.
• BP screening 2-4 times a year",,D,
Q34,A young child presented with nocturnal chest pain and a history of syncope at school. ECG  revealed a cove pattern of sT elevation in V2 and V3. what is the most probable diagnosis?,"a)Myocardial infarction

c)Brugada syndrome
d)DCM","A given clinical scenario of nocturnal chest pain and a history of syncope in a young kid along with ECG findings of coved ST-segment elevation of v1-v3, points towards the diagnosis

Brugada syndrome is an inherited sodium channelopathy (SCN5A mutation) and is most
commonly seen in Southeast Asian males. The age of presentation is usually 40 years. This
syndrome is characterized by an increased risk for sudden cardiac death due to polymorphic
ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is the treatment of choice.
Brugada syndrome is associated with right bundle branch block. It is an inherited disease that predisposes patients to potentially life threatening arrythmias.

Q35,A 26-year-old female presents to the ER with menorrhagia. she mentions that her father and sister also suffer from bleeding disorders. which of the following is an autosomal dominant   bleeding disorder?,"a)Factor X deficiency
b)Factor VIII deficiency
c)Factor IX deficiency
d)Von willebrand Disease","This patient's clinical features are suggestive of von-Willebrand disease. It is caused by a deficiency of the von-Willebrand factor.
They are present within cytoplasmic vesicles called Weibel-palade bodies.
Normal platelet count, prolonged BT, Normal pT, and prolonged apTT are seen in
von-Willebrand disease. Factor VIII is found bound to the Von-Willebrand factor (vWF)  in the blood. Deficiency of vWF results in Factor VIII deficiency and prolongation of apTT in this
disease. prolonged BT is due to abnormal platelet-mediated hemostasis.
vWF is also found in
• platelet granules (Less as compared to endothelial cells)
• subendothelium, where it binds to collagen
Von Willebrand disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder in humans. The bleeding tendency is usually mild and manifests during surgical or dental procedures. The most common     presenting symptoms are spontaneous bleeding from mucous membranes (epistaxis), excessive
bleeding from wounds, or menorrhagia.
It is usually transmitted as an autosomal dominant disorder, but rare autosomal recessive variants can be seen.
Three types are recognized, with phenotypic variations:
Type 1 and type 3 von-Willebrand disease are associated with quantitative defects in vWF.
Type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a mild to moderate vWF deficiency, accounting for about 7o% of all cases. It is associated with mild disease.
Type 3 disease is an autosomal disorder resulting in little to no vWF synthesis. Because vWF
stabilizes factor VIII in the circulation, factor VIII levels are also reduced in type 3 disease and the associated bleeding disorder is often severe.



Type 2 von-Willebrand disease is characterized by qualitative defects in vWF. Type 2A is the most common. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder.
other options:
Factor X, VIII and IX deficiencies are all causes of hemophilias. These conditions manifest as
prolonged bleeding after injuries, dental treatment and hemarthrosis. They are also additionally X-linked conditions so the presence of this condition in her father and sister makes X-linked
transmission impossible.",,D,
Q36,A woman comes with complaints of hyperpigmentation of her palms after an adrenalectomy. she also has new onset vision deficits. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)Nelson syndrome
b)sheehan syndrome
c)Conn's syndrome
d)Addisons disease","The clinical scenario of hyperpigmentation, history of adrenalectomy and visual deficits indicating a probable pituitary adenoma points to the diagnosis of Nelson's syndrome.
Nelson's syndrome is a rare complication of total bilateral adrenalectomy (TBA). TBA is a
procedure used to control hypercortisolism in Cushing's disease (due to ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma) when resection of the primary tumor is not possible.
The loss of feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis following TBA increases CRH. This leads to stimulation of ACTH-secreting corticotroph cells, causing enlargement of the    original pituitary tumor or formation of a new one.
Nelson's syndrome is associated with a clinical triad of:
• Hyperpigmentation
• Excessive ACTH secretion
• Corticotroph adenoma
screening is done with fasting plasma ACTH levels and MRI brain performed at regular
intervals. prophylactic pituitary irradiation may be recommended to prevent its incidence. The  primary treatment is transsphenoidal surgery. patients will also require life-long glucocorticoid replacement, as they do not produce cortisol.
The use of steroidogenic inhibitors in the treatment of Cushing's disease has decreased the need for bilateral adrenalectomy these days.
option B: sheehan syndrome refers to panhypopituitarism. It classically follows massive
postpartum hemorrhage and associated hypotension. The abrupt, severe hypotension leads to
pituitary ischemia and necrosis. patients with the most severe form develop shock due to pituitary apoplexy. pituitary apoplexy is characterized by a sudden onset of headache, nausea, visual
deficits, and hormonal dysfunction due to acute hemorrhage or infarction within the pituitary.
option C: Conn's syndrome or primary aldosteronism occurs due to aldosterone-secreting adrenal adenoma leading to mineralocorticoid excess. It is characterized by hypokalemia,
hypomagnesemia, muscle weakness, proximal myopathy and muscle cramps.
option D: Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency), most commonly caused by
autoimmune adrenalitis presents with hyperpigmentation of the skin, especially in areas exposed to sunlight or prone to friction. This is due to excessive stimulation of melanocytes by the raised   adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This is seen in chronic cases. However, there are no visual symptoms in Addison's disease.",,A,
Q37,These findings are suggestive of which of the following conditions?,"a)Addison's disease
b)Gigantism
c)Acromegaly
d)cushings syndrome","The clinical image of a man with mandibular enlargement, prognathism (protrusion of jaw), and jaw malocclusion suggests the diagnosis of acromegaly.
Acromegaly is a result of growth hormone hypersecretion due to a pituitary adenoma. It can also   occur due to extra pituitary lesions. If growth hormone hypersecretion occurs before the fusion of the growth plates at puberty, it leads to gigantism.
75g of oral glucose load is administered to the patient. The growth hormone levels are measured  within 1-2 hours after administration. Normally, GH should be suppressed to less than o.4 ug/L   after the oral glucose load. A failure of suppression of growth hormone confirms the diagnosis of acromegaly. In some patients, growth hormone levels may demonstrate a paradoxical rise.
Acral bony overgrowth in acromegaly manifests as frontal bossing, increased hand and foot size, mandibular enlargement, prognathism, and widened space between incisors. soft tissue swelling results in increased heel pad thickness, coarse facial features, and a large fleshy nose.
Generalized visceromegaly is seen including cardiomegaly, macroglossia, thyroid enlargement,
etc. serious complications include diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnoea, and increased risk of colonic polyps and cancer.
Acromegaly can be treated by transsphenoidal resection of the tumor. It can also be managed    medically by using octreotide (a somatostatin analog), pegvisomant (Growth Hormone receptor antagonist), dopamine agonists or radiation.
other options:
option A: Addison's disease is a primary adrenal insufficiency in which the adrenal is unable to secrete adequate amounts of cortisol (glucocorticoid), and aldosterone (mineralocorticoid). The features are fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, low blood pressure, postural hypotension,
hypoglycemia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, salt craving, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.
option B: pituitary gigantism is caused by the overproduction of growth hormone, before the
closure of epiphysis. It usually does not present with prognathism as this occurs after the closure  of the growth plates. It presents as longitudinal growth acceleration. It is a rare condition, caused mostly by pituitary adenoma
option D: cushing syndrome results from chronic exposure to excess glucocorticoids. It presents with weight gain, central obesity, hypertension, and hypokalemia. other clinical features include  thin brittle skin with easy bruisability, purple stretch marks, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and
osteopenia.",4501-2833.PNG,C,
