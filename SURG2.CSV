Q1,All are true about intestinal transplantation except ______.,"a)Most of the grafts are multi-visceral grafts.
b)It is not widely used due to vigorous rejection reactions.
c)The most dangerous complication is sepsis.
d)The most common indication is the ischemia","Multivisceral grafts are rarely used in intestinal transplantation. The most common intestinal  graft is small bowel graft, with or without the colon or a combined liver and small bowel graft.
All the other statements are correct.
small bowel transplantation is the final treatment option after the outcome of reconstruction and lengthening procedures are unsatisfactory.
The small bowel transplant is highly immunogenic since it contains a large amount of
gut-associated lymphoid tissue, donor dendritic cells, and macrophages. Acute rejection has been reported in 56–75% of patients, with small bowel transplant limiting the overall survival to only   one-third of recipients.",,A,
Q2,All of the following are boundaries of the triangle of doom except?,"a)vas deferens
b)peritoneal Reflection
c)Iliopubic tract
d)spermatic vessels","Iliopubic tract does not form a boundary of the triangle of doom.
The triangle of doom is bounded
• Medially by the vas deferens



• Laterally by the vessels of the spermatic cord
• Inferiorly by peritoneal reflection
Apex oriented superiorly at the internal ring The contents of the space include
• External iliac vessels
• Deep circumflex iliac vein
• Femoral nerve
• Genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve
Note: Staples are avoided in this region during hernia repair due to the risk of injury to the vessels which might result in severe hemorrhage.",,C,4682-2923.PNG
Q3,All of the following are true about superior mesenteric artery syndrome except?,"a)Third part of duodenum is compressed
b)Angle between sMA and aorta is more than 7o degrees
c)surgical management is by dudenojejunostomy
d)Also known as wilkie’s syndrome","option B is the false statement. In superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome, the
aortomesenteric angle is reduced to less than 25 degrees. The normal aortomesenteric angle is approximately between 38-65 degrees.
SMA syndrome, also called wilkie's syndrome (option D), is characterized by an obstruction of the third part of the duodenum by the SMA (option A) due to compression against fixed
retroperitoneal structures.
Symptoms include episodic epigastric pain associated with vomiting. Risk factors include rapid  childhood growth without compensatory weight gain, profound weight loss, abdominal surgery, inflammatory diseases of the abdomen, and immobilization in a cast that increases lordosis and accentuates the angle of the SMA with the aorta.
Abdominal CT angiography is the investigation of choice. The CT image below shows narrowed aortomesenteric angle in SMA syndrome:





Lifestyle therapy includes frequent small feedings and patients may benefit from lying prone or on their left side postprandially.
In some cases, weight gain or removal of a body cast improves symptoms. Laparoscopic lysis of the ligament of Treitz is beneficial in few cases. The preferred surgical treatment is Strong's
procedure involving duodenojejunostomy (option c).",,B,4683-2925.PNG;4683-2924.PNG
Q4,which of the following type of renal calculi is resistant to the extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy?,"a)struvite
b)cystine
c)Calcium oxalate
d)Uric acid","cystine stones are resistant to extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) due to their
hardness. cystine, brushite, and calcium oxalate monohydrate stones are the most refractory to ESWL fragmentation, with cystine and brushite being the most resistant.



EsWL is a non-invasive method that generates shockwaves outside the body that focus on the stones. It is the most common method of treating urinary tract stones nowadays. stones up to approximately 1.5 cm in size are suitable for this form of treatment.
complications: Infection, haematuria, parenchymal hemorrhage, and perirenal hematoma.
contraindications: obese patients, pregnant patients, and patients taking oral anticoagulants.
Note: stone fragments collecting in the distal ureter following EsWL are known as steinstrasse.",,B,
Q5,An abdominal aortic aneurysm is operated when its size is greater than __________,"a)5 cm
b)6 cm
c)5.5 cm
d)6.5 cm","An asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm in an otherwise fit patient should be considered for repair if &gt;5.5 cm  in diameter (measured by ultrasonography). The annual incidence of rupture rises from 1% or less in aneurysms that are &lt;5.5 cm in diameter to a significant level of nearly   25%, in those that are 7 cm  in diameter.
As open elective surgery (transabdominal) carries a 5% mortality rate, the balance is in favor of elective operation once the maximum diameter is &gt;5.5 cm.
6 monthly follow-up ultrasonographic assessment is indicated for asymptomatic aneurysms &lt;5.5cm in diameter.",,C,
Q6,A 3-day-old neonate presented with recurrent bilious vomiting. An X-ray erect abdomen is given below. what is the next best step in managing this condition?,"a)CT abdomen
b)Gastrograffin follow-through
c)USG abdomen
d)Explorative laparotomy","Explanation:
The given clinical history with an x-ray showing a triple bubble sign is suggestive of jejunal atresia. The next best step is to perform a contrast study to localize the site of obstruction.
small bowel atresias present with intestinal obstruction soon after birth.
• Bilious vomiting is the dominant feature in jejunal atresia
• Abdominal distension is more prominent in ileal atresia
A small amount of pale meconium may be passed, despite the atresia.
plain abdomen radiographs in a jejunal/ileal atresia case will show multiple air-fluid levels and dilated loops. They don't reliably distinguish small and large bowels in neonates and hence
contrast studies are often required to localize the obstruction.
Water-soluble enemas (Gastrogaffin, Hypaque) are particularly useful in differentiating atresia from meconium ileus and Hirschsprung disease. contrast studies also help to rule out distal
intestinal obstruction and occasionally may act therapeutically to relieve obstructions.
In most cases of jejunal/ileal atresia, the distal end of the dilated proximal small bowel is resected and a primary end-to-end anastomosis is done. If the proximal bowel is extremely dilated, it may  need to be tapered to the distal bowel before anastomosis.
other options:
option A:  cT is not recommended for neonates owing to the harmful effects of radiation.



option C: USG abdomen does not help to localize the site of obstruction and is more useful in the diagnosis of intussusception, where there is an abdominal mass.
option D: Explorative laparotomy is not done for diagnosing intestinal atresias.",4675-2919.PNG,B,
Q7,The image shows methylene blue dye being injected in the peritumoral region. what is this procedure useful for?,"a)Localizing the tumor
b)Identifying the margins
c)sentinel lymph node biopsy
d)Identifying metastasis","The utility of injection of methylene blue in the region around the tumor is done for
sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLN) in patients without clinically positive lymph nodes.
SLN biopsy rationale:
• Afferent lymphatics from a primary tumor first drain into the sentinel node before draining into the other nodes. So, if a sentinel lymph node is positive for metastsis, it is possible that the other  axillary nodes are also involved. Hence, axillary dissection would be necessary.
• If the sentinel node is tumor-free, then regional nodal metastasis is unlikely.
The nodes can be identified using fluorescein dye, methylene blue, or radioactive sulfur  colloid-labeled albumin. The dye can be injected into the peritumoral tissue, subareolar, periareolar, or intradermal plane.
Contraindicated in patients with inflammatory breast cancer, stage T4 disease, a history of previous breast cancer or chest wall surgery, breast scarring, and radiotherapy.",4676-2921.PNG,C,
Q8,A 3-month-old child presented with umbilical discharge. Abdomen examination was normal except for the below finding. The next step of management is?,"a)MRI Abdomen
b)USG Abdomen
c)CECT
d)Exploratory laparotomy","The given clinical image is that of a congenital umbilical anomaly such as patent urachus, urachal cyst, and vitelline cyst (resulting from the persistence of omphalomesenteric duct). The next best   step is the USG abdomen to diagnose if the anomaly is cystic, fibrous or fistula and it's
connections.
omphalomesenteric duct abnormalities: vitello intestinal duct or omphalomesenteric duct is the connection between the yolk sac and the midgut during embryonic life, which eventually gets
obliterated. The persistence of the vitellointestinal duct leads to various abnormalities depending on which part of the duct remains patent.
• persistence of the proximal intestinal end of the duct leads to Meckel’s diverticula.
• persistence of the distal end near the umbilicus leads to the umbilical polyp or sinus.
• persistence of the distal end with mucus retention leads to the cyst, which may be associated with the intestine or the umbilicus by a fibrous band.
• A fully patent vitellointestinal duct can lead to an enterocutaneous fistula.





patent urachus occurs due to the failure of urachus to obliterate, resulting in a connection between the bladder and the umbilicus.
urachal cyst occurs when the urachus fails to obliterate but there is no connection between the bladder and the umbilicus.
The given image below shows a urachal cyst (uc) attached to Meckel’s diverticulum (MD) on one side and urinary bladder (uB) on the other side with a patent tract- urachus (u).",4676-2920.PNG,B,4686-2927.PNG;4686-2926.PNG
Q9,which of the following cancers rarely metastasizes to the liver?,"a)Colon
b)Breast
c)Prostate
d)Melanoma","prostate cancers rarely metastasize to the liver.
The most common malignant tumors ofthe liver are metastatic lesions.  The liver is a common site of metastases from gastrointestinal tumors because of dissemination through the portal



venous system. The most relevant metastatic tumor of the liver to the surgeon is colorectal cancer because of the well-documented potential for long-term survival after complete resection.
The more frequent primary sites include carcinomas of the colon, pancreas, lung, and breast in
adults, and neuroblastoma, wilms tumor, and rhabdomyosarcoma in pediatric patients. Although the origin of the tumor is often known when metastases are biopsied, carcinomas ofthe pancreas, stomach, and lung are particularly notorious for being occult primary neoplasms.",,C,
Q10,"A 4o-year-old female presents to the ER with a history of RTA. on examination, GCS is 15/15, heart rate = 11o/min, BP = 9o/6o mmHg, and there is elevated JVP. The right chest is
hyperresonant on percussion with decreased breath sounds. The left chest appears normal. But the patient is dyspneic and ecchymosis is noted over the chest wall. The abdomen was  soft. The probable diagnosis is:","a)Cardiac tamponade
b)Tension pneumothorax
c)Pericardial effusion
d)Massive hemothorax","The given clinical scenario of trauma with decreased breath sounds and a hyper-resonant note on  percussion indicates pneumothorax. The presence of tachycardia, hypotension and elevated JVP is suggestive of tension pneumothorax.
Tension pneumothorax develops when there is a parietal or visceral pleural tear. This tear acts as a one-way valve i.e. air enters the pleural space from the lung or chest wall during inspiration but has no way to escape during expiration, leading to the collapse of the affected lung.
It is characterized by chest pain, tachypnoea, acute dyspnea, sudden onset hemodynamic
compromise (tachycardia, hypotension, low o2 saturation, loss of consciousness), neck vein
distention, tracheal deviation away from the side of injury, decreased chest movements on the
affected side, hyper-resonance on percussion on the affected side and absent or decreased breath sounds on the affected side.
Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis, and treatment should never be delayed awaiting radiological confirmation.
Management includes:
• Immediate management: Needle decompression or needle thoracostomy with a wide bore needle in the 5th intercostal space anterior to the mid-axillary line. In the pediatric age group, the needle thoracostomy location is at the 2nd intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line.
• Definitive management: Tube thoracostomy or chest tube insertion in the 5th intercostal space in the triangle of safety.
The triangle of safety is bounded anteriorly by the lateral border of the pectoralis major,  posteriorly by latissmus dorsi and inferiorly by a horizontal line at the level of the nipple.
The X-ray below shows a left-sided tension pneumothorax. There is a large, well-demarcated area devoid of lung markings on the left side. The yellow arrows are pointing to the tracheal deviation  and the mediastinal shift to the right side.





other options:
options A:  pericardial tamponade can mimic tension pneumothorax, but the absence of a
tympanic note on percussion rules out its possibility. A patient with pericardial tamponade can present with hypotension, raised JVp, and muffled heart sounds (Beck’s triad), with normal
breath sounds and no tracheal shift.
option C: Dullness in percussion at the base of the left inferior angle of scapula in conjunction
with tubular breath sounds (Ewart’s sign), chest pain that improves while sitting upright and
worsens when lying down and pulsus paradoxus are indicative of pericardial effusion. pericardial effusion develops into tamponade when the effusion leads to increased pressure, impairing
ventricular filling and reducing cardiac output.
option D: Massive hemothorax is the accumulation of &gt;15oo ml of blood or one-third or more of the patient’s blood volume in the chest cavity. The patient will have collapsed neck veins,
decreased breath sounds and a dull note on percussion.",,B,4688-2928.PNG
Q11,A 5o-year-old male presents to the emergency with a BP of 16o/1oo mmHg and a heart rate of 12o. CECT done reveals a Stanford A aortic dissection. what is the initial management of this given condition?,"a)Beta blocker medication
b)LMwH
c)Surgical repair
d)Vitamin K inhibitors","The initial management of patients with all types of aortic dissection is beta blocker medication to control hypertension along with pain management. patients with stanford Type A (DeBakey Types
I and II) will require surgical intervention once the patient's blood pressure is stabilized. Aortic dissection occurs when a defect or flap occurs in the intima of the aorta.
predisposing factors:
• Age
• Hypertension
• Marfan syndrome
• pregnancy



• other connective tissue disorders, for example, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, giant cell arteritis, systemic lupus erythematosus
• Coarctation of the aorta
• Turner or Noonan syndromes
• Aortic cannulation site (iatrogenic).
The most typical presentation of aortic dissection is a tearing interscapular pain. The dissection  may also result in aortic wall rupture into the pericardium (cardiac tamponade) or mediastinum (left haemothorax).
Contrast-enhanced CT is currently the most preferred imaging modality for aortic dissection.
Double-lumen aorta is seen on CECT. Transesophageal echocardiography is preferred for patients who are unstable for transportation.
Acute aortic dissection can be classified by the original DeBakey system, based on the location of the proximal tear and distal extent of the dissection flap, or the stanford system which uses the    location of the proximal tear alone.

Management of aortic dissection:



The initial management of patients with all types of aortic dissection is beta-blocker medication to control hypertension along with pain management. The preferred beta-blocker drug is esmolol.
Hemodynamic stability is an important consideration.
• stanford Type A (DeBakey Types I and II) requires surgical intervention once the patient's blood pressure is stabilized.
• stanford Type B (DeBakey type III) is best managed by antihypertensive drugs. For patients with complicated type B dissection, percutaneously placed endovascular stents are currently   preferred. surgery is reserved for the rare patients not suitable for stenting.
other options:
options B and D: Low molecular weight heparin and vitamin K inhibitors are contraindicated in aortic dissection as they can worsen the risk of bleeding.",,A,4689-2929.PNG;4690-2930.PNG
Q12,"A 22-year-old male presented with a hard painless testicular swelling. There were no inguinal, intra-abdominal or mediastinal lymph nodes on CT Scan. The blood investigations showed
AFP levels of &gt; 3ooo. USG shows uniform echotexture and small areas of necrosis. The next line of management is _______.","a)High inguinal orchidectomy
b)Core needle trucut biopsy
c)FNAC
d)whole body PET/CT","The given clinical features of painless testicular swelling with raised AFP levels without distant metastasis point towards the likely diagnosis of stage 1 non-seminomatous germ cell tumour
(NsGCT) of the testis. The next step in management is a high inguinal orchidectomy.
Core needle trucut biopsy and FNAC should be never done when there is a suspicion of testicular neoplasm as it will result in the seeding of tumor cells into the skin and lymphatics, leading to
upstaging of the tumor (options B and C). Currently, there is no role for PET-CT in the routine     evaluation of non-seminomatous germ cell tumor and seminoma at the time of diagnosis (option D).
Testicular tumors are classified according to their predominant cell type:
• Germ cell tumors (9o-95%): seminomatous (seminoma) or NsGCT (embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, teratoma and choriocarcinoma).
• sex cord-stromal tumors (1-2%): Leydig cell tumors, sertoli cell tumors



• Lymphoma (3-7%)
• other tumors (1-2%)
The most common presentation of testicular cancer is painless testicular mass. Pain is more
commonly associated with NsGCT and two-thirds of patients present with metastatic disease at
the time of diagnosis. The symptoms of metastatic disease include abdominal pain, dyspnea, chest pain, cough or hemoptysis.
Management of testicular tumours:
• ultrasound of the testis should be done in all suspected cases of a testicular tumour to confirm the diagnosis.
• Tumor markers (AFP, hCG, LDH) are measured for the staging of cancer.
• CT- chest, abdomen, and pelvis are done to detect metastasis.
• orchidectomy via an inguinal incision (high inguinal orchidectomy) is the best line of treatment in case of a suspected testicular tumour.
• Further management is based on staging. The older staging is preferred over the TNM staging for treatment and is given below:
• stage I: Tumour is confined to testis and epididymis
• stage II: Nodal tissue is present but is confined to nodes below the diaphragm
• stage III: Nodal involvement above the diaphragm
• stage IV: Non-lymphatic metastatic spread (mostly in lungs)
• stage I tumours:
• Combination chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cis-platinum (BEP chemotherapy) is given for NsGCTs, as they are radio-resistant.
• Chemotherapy with cisplatinum and radiotherapy to para-aortic lymph nodes can be given in seminomas as they are radiosensitive.
• stage II-IV tumours (seminomas and NsGCTs) are treated with BEP chemotherapy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection if needed.",,A,
Q13,A condition requires the surgery depicted in the image shown below. All the following are usually seen associated with this condition except?,"a)Absent kidney
b)Hepatic artery anomalies
c)Malrotation of gut
d)Polysplenia","The given image shows a Roux-en-y loop of the small intestine (jejunum) attached to an area of the liver capsule (Roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy), which is suggestive of kasai
hepatoportoenterostomy procedure done for biliary atresia in infants. An absent kidney is not associated with this condition.
Extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA) is defined as a partial or total absence of permeable bile
duct between porta hepatis and the duodenum. It is due to inflammatory fibrosis of the biliary  tree. It leads to obstruction to bile flow thereby causing leaking of conjugated bilirubin into the circulation.
Associated anomalies include cardiac lesions, polysplenia, situs inversus, absent vena cava, and a preduodenal portal vein.



In the kasai procedure, the extrahepatic biliary tree is dissected proximally till the liver capsule, the porta hepatis is transected and a jejunal loop is anastomosed in order to provide a drainage  pathway for bile.
Infants with biliary atresia, who do not achieve successful drainage after kasai's procedure,
require liver transplantation within the first year of life. This is the most common reason for liver transplantation in children.

Q14,You are doing an emergency laparotomy for a case of intestinal obstruction. which organ will you first visualize to know if this is a case of small bowel or large bowel obstruction?,"a)Ileum
b)caecum
c)Jejunum
d)sigmoid colon","The cecum is the first organ to be visualized to differentiate between the small and large bowel in cases of intestinal obstruction.
Distension of the cecum will confirm large bowel involvement. The identification of a collapsed distal segment of the large bowel and its sequential proximal assessment will lead to the
identification of the cause.",,B,
Q15,what is the best position for a conscious patient to be in during the insertion of a Ryle's tube?,"a)supine with neck flexion
b)supine with neck extension
c)sitting with neck flexion
d)sitting with neck extension","The best position for a conscious patient to be in during the insertion of Ryle's tube (RT) is sitting with neck flexion. The described position helps in directing the RT towards the esophagus and
also prevents it from coiling in the oropharynx or entering the trachea.
RT, also known as nasogastric (NG) tube, measures 12o-125 cm. It has 4 markings at 4ocm (cardia), 5ocm (body), 6ocm (pylorus), and 7o cm (duodenum) to indicate the approximate position after the placement.
Indications for NG tube:
• Feeding in patients with dysphagia, decreased appetite, or those who are nil per os (NPO) for medical or surgical reasons.
• Aspiration of gastric fluid
• Gastric decompression in cases of intestinal obstruction and paralytic ileus.
• zollinger-Ellison syndrome
• Bowel irrigation



The absolute contraindications for an NG tube are severe midface trauma, recent nasal surgery, and basilar skull fractures
steps for the correct insertion of RT in an adult:
• Examination of the patient’s nostril for any anatomical abnormalities and then instillation with 1o ml of 1% lignocaine
• NEX method is used to measure the length of the RT:  place the exit port of the tube at the tip of the nose. Extend the tube to the earlobe, and then to the xiphisternum.
• The patient is asked to sit upright with partial neck flexion. The tip of the Ryle’s tube is
lubricated and passed along the floor of the nasal passage until a resistance is felt(corresponds to nasopharynx)
• The patient is subsequently asked to swallow water to guide the tube through the esophagus into the stomach until the marked length (based on the NEX method).
• NG tube is finally taped to secure it in place.
confirmation of the correct position is done by:
• Auscultation in the epigastric area while injecting a bolus of air
• X-ray chest to locate the lead markers
• Aspiration of contents and subsequently confirming gastric origin (pH &lt;6 indicates gastric placement)",,C,4693-2931.PNG
Q16,pick from the following the usual cause of thyroid storm in thyroidectomy:,"a)Rough handling of thyroid during surgery
b)Due to parathyroid gland
c)Inadequate patient preparation
d)Infections","The usual cause of thyroid storm in thyroidectomy is inadequate patient preparation before surgery. patient preparation pre-operatively involves ensuring a euthyroid state.
Rough handling of the thyroid in thyroidectomy does not cause a thyroid storm. Though a
significant amount of thyroglobulin is stored in the acinar cells, they are inactive unless converted



to thyroxine (T3 and T4).",,C,
Q17,"which of the following colored cannula will you use to achieve maximum flow rate, in a patient who needs a large amount of fluids?","a)Grey

b)Eyes-2, verbal-NT, Motor-5
c)Eyes-3, verbal-1, Motor-6
d)Eyes-3, verbal-NT, Motor-6","The patients GCS is Eyes-3, verbal-NT, Motor-6.
It is calculated as follows:
• Eye opening: opening to verbal command - 3
• verbal response: In the case of endotracheal intubation, the verbal response score is noted as NT (non-testable)
• Motor respone: Movement of all 4 limbs spontaneously - 6

Q19,"A patient was brought to the casualty after a road traffic accident (RTA) with chest trauma.     He is conscious and speaks single words. He has a respiratory rate of 44 cycles per min and a BP of 9o/4o mmHg. There is a hyper-resonance on percussing the right side of his chest.
what will be your next, immediate step?","a)Intubate the patient
b)Insert needle in appropriate intercostal space
c)Start intravenous fluids urgently
d)Take a chest X-ray","The given clinical scenario of chest trauma with a hyper resonant note on the right side suggests  pneumothorax. Hemodynamic instability in this patient suggests tension pneumothorax and this is managed by immediate decompression by insertion of a needle in the appropriate place.
pneumothorax refers to the presence of excess air in the pleural space. Entrapment of air occurs by:
• primary spontaneous pneumothorax - Due to the spontaneous rupture of apical pleural blebs or cystic spaces immediately below the visceral pleura.
• Secondary pneumothorax - Due to the rupture of dilated cystic spaces in lung diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (CopD)
• Tension pneumothorax - Due to a one-way valve mechanism that directs airflow into the pleural space leading to a higher than atmospheric pressure environment. This leads to the affected lung  being unable to expand appropriately and leads to hemodynamic instability.
Tension pneumothorax is a surgical emergency and the excessive pressure has to be immediately relieved. A chest X-ray is not required before emergency decompression as it is a clinical
diagnosis, but an X-ray should be done following chest tube insertion (option D). Tension
pneumothorax is managed by immediate needle decompression in the 5th ICS (adults), followed by definitive management with a chest tube inserted in the same space.
other options:
option A: Intubation is performed when the patient is unresponsive post chest tube insertion.



option C: while IV fluids are a part of the resuscitation protocol, the management of tension pneumothorax takes higher precedence as the next immediate step.
Note: According to ATLS 1oth edition
• In adults, needle thoracostomy or needle decompression location is changed to the 5th ICS anterior to the midaxillary line from the 2nd ICS midclavicular line.
• In the pediatric age group, the needle thoracostomy location remains at the 2nd ICS midclavicular line.",,B,
