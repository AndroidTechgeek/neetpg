Q1,which of the following stain can be used for laryngeal mass seen during laryngoscopic examination?,"a)Congo red
b)silver nitrate
c)H &amp; E
d)supra vital","Laryngoscopic image shows growth over the vocal cords; supravital stain is used to detect laryngeal mass seen during laryngoscopic examination.
In the larynx, it is difficult to identify carcinoma in situ, early infiltrating carcinoma, and the exact margins of an established carcinoma. However, it has been found that the use of toluidine blue as  a supravital stain during direct laryngoscopy is a reliable adjunct to the early and precise
diagnosis of carcinoma of the larynx.
Also, toluidine blue staining is useful in improving the rate of negative resection margins of early glottic cancer (T1a–T2) treated by TLM (transoral oral microsurgery). This technique is called
chromoendoscopy, where the interpretation is based on the colour: a dark blue (royal or navy) stain is considered positive, light blue staining is doubtful, and when no color is observed, it is interpreted as a negative stain, as shown below",3384-2116.PNG,D,3392-2125.PNG
Q2,An 18-year-old male presents to the emergency department with epistaxis and a nasal mass. what is the investigation of choice to evaluate his condition?,"a)Plain CT
b)CECT PNs and nose
c)MRI
d)X-ray","History of nasal mass and associated epistaxis in an 18-year-old raises the suspicion of
nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. CECT ofthe PNS and nose can be done to evaluate the patient.
CECT of the PNS and nose is particularly useful for revealing characteristic findings such as the anterior bowing of the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus, known as the Antral sign or
Holman-Miller sign (shown in the image below), which is indicative of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma.


Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is a benign but locally invasive tumor that predominantly affects adolescent males aged 1o-2o years. It typically originates from the posterior part of the nasal
cavity near the superior margin of the sphenopalatine foramen and is thought to be
testosterone-dependent. Clinically, this condition presents with profuse, recurrent spontaneous



epistaxis, progressive nasal obstruction, conductive hearing loss, and otitis media with effusion. It may also cause additional features such as proptosis, cheek swelling, and broadening of the nasal  bridge.
Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical presentation, with CECT serving as the preferred imaging technique to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the tumor. Carotid angiography may   be performed to evaluate the vascularity of the tumor and its feeding vessels, typically arising
from the external carotid artery, and potentially from the internal carotid system in cases of larger tumors with intracranial extension. Biopsy of the mass is generally avoided due to the risk of
severe bleeding.
staging of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma
surgery is the treatment of choice. Embolization of the vessels can be done prior to surgery to reduce the risk of bleeding during the surgery. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal
therapy can also be considered.

Q3,"A female patient presents with nausea, vomiting, and a sensation of objects moving around  her. she is diagnosed with left vestibular neuritis. Her head impulse test is positive. what is the correct finding?","a)Right saccade with right side movement
b)Left saccade with right side movement
c)Right saccade with left side movement
d)Left saccade with left side movement","In the case of left vestibular neuritis, the correct finding on the head impulse test is a right saccade with left-side movement.
The head impulse test is to assess the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The abnormal head impulse test result is due to the VOR being impaired on the side of the vestibular lesion leading to



saccades. saccades are rapid, ballistic movements of the eyes that abruptly try to return to the point of fixation/ gaze.
The head impulse test is done by asking the patient to focus on a target. Then, the patient's head is quickly rotated to the left or right. If there is a deficiency in the vOR, the head movement will  be followed by a catch-up saccade in the opposite direction. Thus, in left vestibular neuritis, a
rightward saccade is seen following a left-side head rotation.
vestibular neuritis is distinguished from central causes of vertigo by its characteristic findings: a    positive head impulse test, absence of skew deviation, and spontaneous unidirectional nystagmus. Central vertigo, on the other hand, presents with a normal head impulse test, vertical skew
deviation, bidirectional nystagmus, and additional neurological signs like diplopia, weakness, or dysarthria. In acute vestibular syndrome, especially in older patients with vascular risk factors,   evaluation for a possible stroke is warranted.
vestibular neuritis resolves spontaneously, but glucocorticoids can improve outcomes if
administered within 3 days of symptom onset. Antiviral medications are only suggested for
Herpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome). vestibular suppressant medications can reduce acute symptoms. patients should be encouraged to resume normal activity as soon as possible.  vestibular rehabilitation therapy can also be tried.",,C,3394-2126.PNG
Q4,Match the following with the nerve supply of external ear:,"a)A - Auriculotemporal nerve; B - Greater auricular nerve; C - Facial and vagus nerve
b)A - Greater auricular nerve; B - Auriculotemporal nerve; C - Facial and vagus nerve
c)A - Greater auricular nerve; B - Facial and vagus nerve; C - Auriculotemporal nerve
d)A - Facial and vagus nerve; B - Greater auricular nerve; C - Auriculotemporal nerve","The correctly matched option regarding the nerve supply of the pinna is option B: A - Greater auricular nerve; B - Auriculotemporal nerve; C - Facial and vagus nerve.
The nerve supply of the pinna is provided by the following:
• Greater auricular nerve (A) supplies most of the medial surface of the pinna and the posterior part of the lateral surface.
• Lesser occipital nerve supplies the upper part of the medial surface.
• Auriculotemporal nerve  (B) supplies the tragal area and crus helix.



• Arnold's nerve (C) i.e. the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (CN X) supplies the concha and the corresponding area on the medial surface.
• Facial nerve (CN VII) (C) which is distributed along with Arnold's nerve also supplies the concha and the retro auricular groove.
The nerve supply has been demonstrated in the image below.",3385-2117.PNG,B,3395-2128.PNG;3395-2127.PNG
Q5,"A female singer presents with hoarseness of voice and difficulty singing in a high pitch. on
laryngoscopy, it was noted that one vocal cord is bowed, positioned lower than the other, and the associated muscle is shortened. which muscle is likely affected in this scenario?","a)posterior Cricoarytenoid
b)Lateral cricoarytenoid
c)Interarytenoid
d)cricothyroid","The affected muscle is likely the cricothyroid muscle, one of the paired intrinsic muscles of the
larynx, which is responsible for elongating and tensing the vocal cords to produce higher pitches.
The cricothyroid muscle and the vocalis muscle(the internal part of the thyroarytenoid) are crucial for adjusting the tension of the vocal cords to produce higher pitches. The cricothyroid muscle, in



particular, plays a unique role by elongating and tensing the vocal cords, which is essential for   achieving high-pitched phonation. This muscle's function is directly influenced by the external   branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, which supplies it and facilitates the adjustment of pitch.
The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve descends along the larynx, situated beneath the sternothyroid muscle, to innervate the cricothyroid muscle. By activating this muscle, the
external branch enables the tension of the vocal cords to be increased, thereby contributing to the production of higher-pitched sounds. This intricate nerve-muscle interaction highlights the
specialized role of the cricothyroid muscle in pitch modulation and vocal quality.",,D,3396-2129.PNG
Q6,what is the marked structure of the cochlear implant shown below?,"a)Ground electrode
b)Internal magnet
c)Transmitter coil
d)Receiver stimulator antenna","The marked structure in the radiology image of the cochlear implant is the ground electrode.
A cochlear implant is a medical device that uses electricity to stimulate the spiral ganglion cells of the auditory nerve to restore sensorineural hearing loss. It can be used in a patient with bilateral   severe sensorineural hearing loss.
It converts sound to an electrical signal (transduction) and delivers this to the hearing nerve, which bypasses the damaged hearing apparatus. It cannot be used in patients with cochlear   aplasia or without the VIIIth cranial nerve.
cochlear implant:
• An electronic device for severe to profound SNHL and who cannot benefit from a hearing aid.
• principle- surgery to place the electrode array within the scala tympani of the cochlea.
• Indication- bilateral severe to profound deafness
• prerequisites- intact 8th nerve and higher auditory pathway
• Surgical approach- facial recess (posterior tympanotomy) approach
• The electrode of a cochlear implant is placed in the scala tympani. (Note: In the auditory brainstem implant, the site of the implant is the lateral recess of the 4th ventricle.)



The receiver-stimulator implanted during surgery (under the skin) and the electrode
array (implanted in the scala tympani of the cochlea) are part of the internal component of the cochlear implant. The microphone, speech processor and transmitter are part of the external    component of the cochlear implant, which remains outside the body.
Cochlear implants replace the non-functional transducer system of hair cells of the cochlea and
convert the sound signal to electrical impulses, which directly stimulate the fibres of cranial nerve VIII.",3386-2118.PNG,A,3397-2131.PNG;3397-2130.PNG
Q7,"A patient presented with nasal congestion and upon examination, nasal polyps were
observed. A coronal cT scan of the patient was taken and is as shown below. which of the following sinus drainage pathways is likely to be affected?","a)Ethmoid
b)Frontal
c)Maxillary
d)sphenoid","In this patient with rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps, the CT scan indicates that the maxillary sinus is likely affected, as evidenced by the presence of a polyp in this sinus.



Antrochoanal polyp is a type of non-neoplastic nasal polypoidal masses of edematous nasal or
sinus mucosa. It arises from the mucosa of the maxillary antrum near its accessory ostium, comes out of it, and grows in the choana and nasal cavity. It is usually single and unilateral which
are more commonly seen in children and young adults.
It has 3 parts namely
• Thin antral stalk,
• Round and globular choanal part, and
• Flat nasal part.
The clinical features include unilateral nasal obstruction, mucoid nasal discharge, and a hyponasal voice.
Anterior rhinoscopy may miss the antrochoanal polyp when it starts to grow posteriorly. A large polyp may protrude from the nasal cavity and may appear pink and congested. It is soft and can be moved with a probe. posterior rhinoscopy may reveal a globular mass filling the choana and   hanging down behind the soft palate.
X-ray (lateral view) of soft tissue nasopharynx, reveals a globular swelling in the postnasal space, it is differentiated from angiofibroma by the presence of a column of air behind the polyp known as Dodd sign or crescent sign.
Diagnosis is made by radiograph of the paranasal sinuses reveals opacity of the involved
antrum. Non-contrast CT scan reveals the extent of the polyp. Endoscopic examination reveals the antrochoanal polyp hidden posteriorly in the nasal cavity.
Endoscopic sinus surgery is the treatment of choice. Recurrence is uncommon after the complete removal of the polyp.",3387-2120.PNG,C,3398-2132.PNG;3236-1997.PNG
Q8,which of the following statements is true regarding an esophageal foreign body?,"a)Impaction can not cause mediastinitis
b)More commonly seen in adults
c)Most common site of impaction is at level of cricopharyngeus
d)one of the constrictions of the esopahgus is at the level of the right bronchus","The correct statement with regard to the oesophageal foreign body in the image is that the most common site of impaction is at the level of the cricopharyngeus.
Foreign bodies commonly ingested by children are coins, disk batteries, and small toy items. In adults, it is usually a food bolus (mostly meat) that gets lodged.
The flat surface of a coin is seen on the anteroposterior view (AP view) and the edge is seen on the lateral view. This indicates that it is oriented in the coronal plane, which is seen when it is lodged  in the esophagus (and not in the trachea).
Initial symptoms are choking, gagging, and coughing followed by excessive salivation, dysphagia, food refusal, vomiting, or pain in the neck and throat. Respiratory symptoms such as stridor,
wheezing, cyanosis, or dyspnea are seen if the esophageal foreign body impinges on the larynx or tracheal wall. Imaging with chest and abdominal X-rays should be performed in AP and lateral     positions. Chest CT should always be performed if oesophageal perforation is suspected.
Endoscopic removal of the esophageal foreign body is the procedure of choice. It should be performed
• Immediately in esophageal obstruction, disk batteries, and sharp pointed objects.
• within 12-24 hours in non-pointed objects, pointed objects in the stomach, and coins in the esophagus.
• Non-urgent removal in objects in stomach &gt;2.5cm in diameter, and disk battery in the stomach (up to 48h)
other options:
option A: If a foreign body becomes lodged in the esophagus and causes perforation, it can lead to mediastinitis, a potentially life-threatening infection of the mediastinum.



option c: Esophageal foreign bodies are more commonly seen in children, although they do occur in adults, particularly in those with underlying esophageal abnormalities (e.g., strictures or
motility disorders).
option D: The esophagus has several natural constrictions, including at the cricopharyngeus (c6 level), at the aortic arch, at the level of the left main bronchus and at the diaphragmatic hiatus.",3387-2119.PNG,C,
Q9,In which procedure is the incision showed in the image used?,"a)caldwell Luc's procedure
b)Modified Denker's
c)open rhinoplasty
d)Midface degloving procedure","The incision shown is used in open rhinoplasty.
This procedure involves a transcolumellar incision, an incision made across the columella to lift the nasal skin, allowing full access to the underlying nasal structures. This approach is used for  cosmetic or reconstructive surgery. The open technique allows better visibility of the nasal
framework compared to closed rhinoplasty.
other options:
option A: The caldwell-Luc operation, also known as anterior antrostomy, involves opening the  maxillary sinus via the canine fossa through a sublabial approach to address various pathologies within the sinus. It's indicated for conditions like chronic maxillary sinusitis, dental cysts,
oroantral fistula, neoplasms, and certain fractures. surgery is contraindicated for patients below
17 years of age.
option B: The modified Denker's procedure is similar to the caldwell-Luc procedure but involves   more extensive exposure of the maxillary sinus and nasal cavity. It’s used for the removal of larger sinus tumors.
option D: Midface degloving approach is a facial incision-less approach used for accessing the midface, including the nasal cavity and sinuses.
It’s commonly used in removing large nasal and sinus tumors, and it involves incisions within the oral cavity and nasal vestibule, avoiding external scars. No incision on the nose itself is involved.",3388-2121.PNG,C,
Q10,"The patient complains of repeated episodes of crusting in the nose with occasional bleeding. she had undergone surgery for nasal obstruction four months back. on examination, the
following finding is seen. which surgery has the highest likelihood to result in this complication?","a)FESS
b)Submucosal resection
c)Denker's method
d)Inferior meatotomy","The given clinical vignette of a patient with complaints of repeated episodes of crusting in the
nose with occasional bleeding and a history of nasal surgery for nasal obstruction is likely to have  undergone correction of her DNs(Deviated Nasal septum). The image is that of septal perforation; sMR (submucosal resection ) has a higher likelihood of causing the same.
septal perforation can occur after nasal surgery. Features depend on the size of the perforation. smaller perforations can present with whistling while the larger perforations will present with    epistaxis and crust formation. Therefore, septoplasty has become a more favored treatment of    DNs than sMR due to its conservative approach.
septoplasty is a conservative technique in the surgical correction of septal deformity. The key
advantage is that it can be carried out as a daycare procedure, most of the bone and cartilage are retained, and complications are less. The deformed septum may corrected by various techniques like scoring the concave side, shaving, and wedge excision. sometimes realignment by joining



straight pieces of the septum outside the nose and replacing them can be done which is called extra-corporeal septoplasty.
The indications for an SMR are:
• DNS causing symptoms of nasal obstruction and recurrent headaches.
• DNS causing obstruction of paranasal sinuses and middle ear, resulting in recurrent sinusitis and otitis media.
• Recurrent epistaxis from a septal spur.
• As a part of septorhinoplasty, for cosmetic correction of external nasal deformities.
• As a preliminary step in hypophysectomy or vidian neurectomy.
It is contraindicated in children below 17 years of age, during acute respiratory infection, bleeding diathesis, untreated diabetes, or hypertension.
In this procedure, mucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flaps are raised on both sides of the septum. Bony and cartilaginous parts of the septum are excised. This is followed by extensive
dissection of the septum removing all deformed bony and cartilaginous parts of the septum and preserving only a caudal and a dorsal strut of cartilage.
There is a greater chance of complications associated with SMR that include bleeding, septal
hematoma, septal abscess, perforation, depression of the nasal bridge, retraction of the columella, and persistence of the deviation. The flapping of the nasal septum and toxic shock syndrome
following SMR can also occur.
other options:
option A: FESS (Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery) is a minimally invasive procedure to
enlarge nasal drainage pathways and improve sinus ventilation; rarely causes septal perforation.
option c: Denker Approach is a surgical technique to access the maxillary sinus, pterygopalatine, and infratemporal fossae, used for large sinonasal tumors and extensive sinus pathology.
option D: Endoscopic Surgical Treatment of odontogenic Maxillary Sinusitis involves middle or inferior meatotomy; inferior meatotomy is preferred for foreign bodies or sinus floor cysts.

Q11,"A 4o-year-old woman presents with mild, progressive, bilateral hearing loss. A PTA showed the following findings. what is the most likely clinical finding in this patient?","a)Hennebert sign
b)Hitzelberger sign
c)schwartze sign
d)Bryce's sign","The clinical scenario describes a 4o-year-old female patient with mild, progressive, bilateral   hearing loss, and a PTA showing carhart's notch (dip in bone conduction at 2ooo Hz) are all suggestive of otosclerosis and the classical sign seen here is schwartze sign.
The presence of a reddish hue on the promontory through the tympanic membrane, known as the schwartze sign, suggests an active focus.
otosclerosis is caused by bony overgrowth involving the enchondral layer of the bony otic capsule. It presents with bilateral progressive conductive hearing loss and tinnitus. It has an autosomal
dominant inheritance and can worsen with stress and hormonal changes like during pregnancy and menopause.
stapedial otosclerosis is the most common type of otosclerosis. Here the lesion starts just in front of the oval window in an area called fistula ante fenestrae.
PTA shows loss of air conduction with air-bone gap, more for lower frequencies and carhart's
notch may be seen. Tympanometry shows an As type of tympanogram in which there is reduced compliance at or near the ambient air pressure.
Medical management with sodium fluoride is used in the active stage. Definitive treatment is
stapedectomy/stapedotomy with the placement of a prosthesis. carhart notch usually disappears after a successful stapedectomy.
other options:
option A: Hennebert sign is pressure-induced dizziness seen in patients with superior
semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome, congenital syphilis, and Méniére’s disease.
option B: compression of the facial nerve due to acoustic neuroma will result in hypoesthesia of the posterior wall of the external auditory canal. This is called the Hitzelberger sign.
option D: The gurgling sound produced on pressing the swelling in the laryngocele is known as Bryce's sign.",3389-2122.PNG,C,
Q12,"A 7o-year-old man presents with unilateral hearing loss. on examination, a small perforation is noted on his left tympanic membrane. what will be the left-sided Rinne's test finding in
this patient?","a)positive
b)False postive
c)Negative
d)Intermediate","This patient with unilateral hearing loss and a small perforation of his tympanic membrane is
likely to have conductive hearing loss in the left ear, which will show a negative Rinne's test in the affected ear.
Tuning fork tests are performed commonly with tuning forks of frequencies such as 128, 256, 512, 1o24, etc. The tuning fork of 512 Hz is considered ideal as forks oflower frequencies produce a
sense of bone vibration while those of higher frequencies have a shorter decay time. some examples of commonly done tuning fork tests are as follows:





Rinne’s test is done by placing a vibrating tuning fork on the patient’s mastoid and when he stops hearing, it is brought beside the external auditory meatus (EAC). If he still hears the sound, air
conduction (AC) is better than bone conduction (BC). The inferences are as follows:
• Rinne's test is considered positive (normal) when the air conduction AC&gt;BC is seen in normal people and people with sensorineural deafness.
• It is considered negative when the BC&gt;AC, and is seen in patients with conductive deafness. It suggests a minimum hearing loss of 15-2o dB.
weber test is done by placing a vibrating tuning in the middle of the forehead or the vertex and the patient is asked in which ear the sound is heard. The inferences are as follows:
• A normal result is achieved when the sound heard equally in both ears
• In conductive deafness, it is lateralized to the worse ear
• In sensorineural deafness, it is lateralized to the better ear
other options:
option A: Rinne's test is positive in normal subjects.
option B: Rinne's test is falsely negative in patients with sudden severe unilateral sensorineural hearing loss.
option B: There is no such interpretation as intermediate in Rinne's test.",,C,3403-2133.PNG
Q13,"A 5o-year-old woman presents with hearing loss in the left ear and episodic pulsatile tinnitus. on examination, there was a mass in the middle ear behind the tympanic membrane. A CT
performed is as shown below. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)Glomus tympanicum
b)Reparative granuloma
c)Glomus jugulare
d)Acoustic neuroma","The given clinical vignette of a woman with hearing loss and pulsatile tinnitus and examination     suggesting a mass behind the tympanic membrane and CT image showing a mass in the region of jugular foramen makes Glomus Jugulare the likely diagnosis.
Glomus tumors are the most common benign tumors ofthe middle ear. The tumors comprise
paraganglionic cells and arise from glomus bodies which resemble carotid bodies. Glomus bodies



are present in the dome of the jugular bulb and on the promontory along the course of the tympanic branch of the IX cranial nerve.
They are most commonly seen in females between the ages of 4o-5o years. They are very
slow-growing, thus it may take years before changes in symptoms are appreciated. It follows the rule of 1os - 1o% are familial, 1o% are multicentric, and 1o% are functional (secrete
catecholamines).
Depending on the area from which it arises, glomus tumors are classified into two types:
• Glomus jugulare, arising from the dome of the jugular bulb
• Glomus tympanicum, arising from the promontory of the middle ear The presentation of glomus tumors is as follows:
• Intratympanic presentation
• progressive hearing loss
• pulsatile tinnitus is synchronous with pulse and can be stopped by carotid pressure
• otoscopy: red reflex through the intact tympanic membrane
• Rising sign when a tumor arises from the floor of the middle ear
• pulsation or Brown sign: when the ear canal pressure is raised with siegel's speculum the tumor pulsates and blanches. This reverses when pressure is released.
• polyp presentation
• profuse bleeding
• otorrhea if there is a secondary infection
• Red vascular polyp filling the meatus that bleeds easily
• Cranial nerve palsies
• Dysphagia and hoarseness with unilateral paralysis of the soft palate, and pharynx due to IX and X
• vocal cord paralysis due to X
• weakness of the trapezius and sternomastoid muscles XI
• Atrophy of half of the tongue XII
• Audible bruit over the mastoid
They can be diagnosed by CT scan, MRI, four-vessel angiography, brain perfusion and flow
studies, embolization, and biopsy. It is treated by surgery, radiation, embolization, or a
combination of them. phlep sign is seen in a CT scan of the glomus jugulare tumor. It is erosion of the normal crest of bone between the carotid canal and jugular foramen.
The following image shows the rising sun sign in the case of glomus jugulare.





other options:
option A: Glomus tympanicum is a close differential to the jugular tumor, however, it commonly arises from the promontory of the middle ear rather than the jugular bulb and does not show the phlep sign and it is also found in relation to the temporal bone on CT.
option B: Giant cell reparative granuloma accounts for 1–7% of all benign lesions of the jaw. It
often arises in the maxilla followed by the mandible and affects children and young adults. It is
usually a slow-growing lesion. The fast-growing lesions are rare and despite the innocent
histological appearance, have an aggressive behavior mimicking a malignant lesion. The following image shows the CT of the reparative granuloma of the maxilla showing the extension of tumor
mass over the pterygoid plates and infratemporal fossa.


option D: Acoustic neuromas are noncancerous, usually slow-growing tumors that form along the vestibulocochlear nerve. They arise from schwann cells. schwannomas can occur on any cranial     or peripheral nerve in the body, but in the brain, acoustic neuromas are the most common



schwannomas. The following image depicts the classical ice cream cone appearance of acoustic neuroma on MRI.",3390-2124.PNG,C,3405-2135.PNG;3405-2134.PNG;3406-2136.PNG
