Q8,what does the given image represent?,"a)Hypnogram
b)Electroencephalogram
c)polysomnogram
d)Epworth sleep assessment","The above image represents a hypnogram. It is a graph that depicts the stages of sleep as a function of time. It provides a visual representation of sleep structure and is useful in the    diagnosis of various sleep disorders.
An electroencephalogram is the depiction of the electrical activity of the surface of the brain.
Different waveforms (alpha, beta, theta, delta) are produced depending on the functional status of the brain.


polysomnography is a multi parametric test that is considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of sleep disorders. It is a continuous recording of biophysiological changes that occur during
sleep. It includes,
• Continuous EEG recording, from occipital and parietal leads
• Electro-oculography- to record eye movements
• Electromyography- for muscle potential and its activities
• ECG
• Multiple sleep latency tests- repeated measures of time taken to sleep
• Nasal-oral airflow, respiratory effort, oxyhemoglobin saturation, and leg movements during sleep are measured.





Epworth sleep assessment scale is a questionnaire used to quantify daytime sleepiness. It
determines how frequently a patient is likely to doze off in 8 commonly encountered situations. It is a subjective assessment and hence less reliable.",3768-2421.PNG,A,3772-2422.PNG;3772-2422.PNG

• Impaired executive functions such as motivation, attention, and sequencing of actions
• Aphasia, apraxia, constructional apraxia, neglect, and memory deficits
• urinary incontinence and fecal incontinence is commonly seen
• changes in personality
• Apathetic indifference and impulsive behavior.
Note: Frontal lobe pathology may become apparent only under unstructured, stressful, real-life  situations and are difficult to detect using Intelligence scales, as IQ mostly requires parietal lobe activation.",,C,
