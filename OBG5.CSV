Q1,In which trimester does acute fatty liver manifest most commonly during pregnancy?,"a)First trimester
b)second trimester
c)Third trimester
d)Both (a) and (b)","Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) occurs most commonly in the third trimester or early postpartum period.
Risk factors include Pre-eclampsia/HELLP syndrome, male fetus, previous history of AFLP, and multiple gestations.
AFLP (acute yellow atrophy or acute fatty metamorphosis) is the most common cause of acute liver failure in pregnancy. It usually occurs in the later stages of pregnancy, particularly in
the third trimester. It occurs due to fetal deficiency of long-chain acyl-coenzyme A
dehydrogenase (LCHAD) or poor placental mitochondrial function.
The patients present with persistent nausea and vomiting, progressive jaundice, and epigastric
pain. Features like acute hemolysis, hypoglycemia, hypertension, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, and edema can also be present. Symptoms may progress to fulminant hepatic failure with
encephalopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death.
Liver function tests such as AST, ALT, and serum bilirubin levels are raised. Hypofibrinogenemia, hypocholesterolemia, and prolonged clotting time can be seen. An elevated d-dimer is
seen. Microscopy reveals a characteristic microvesicular fatty infiltration.



The condition worsens till delivery after which the hepatic dysfunction resolves. A trial of labor by induction or delivery by cesarean is done. Intensive supportive measures including blood
transfusion should be provided.
The clinical and laboratory findings of acute liver diseases in pregnancy are as follows:
The condition worsens till delivery after which the hepatic dysfunction resolves. Appropriate
management is immediate termination of pregnancy irrespective of gestational age by induction or delivery by cesarean (for obstetric reasons) is done. Intensive supportive measures including  blood transfusion should be provided.

Q2,A 55-year-old lady comes with abnormal uterine bleeding. A hysterectomy was performed and the following specimen was retrieved. what is the diagnosis?,"a)Leiomyoma
b)Endometrial carcinoma
c)Endometrial polyp
d)Adenomyosis","The given cut section image showing multiple nodules, well-circumscribed, firm, and
white-greyish with a whorled appearance is Leiomyoma (Fibroid).
Leiomyoma is the most common benign and the most common pelvic tumor in females and is
more common in obese females(hyper-estrogenism). They are mostly asymptomatic and the most common symptom is menorrhagia.
Leiomyomas can also present with bleeding areas, cystic degeneration, and calcifications. The uterine cavity is compressed.
The image below different types of uterine fibroids classified according to their locations:





sub-mucous fibroids are the most symptomatic type and intra-mural fibroids are the most common type of uterine fibroids.
other options:
option B: Endometrial cancer presents as a polypoid mass protruding into the uterine cavity or as a diffuse thickening of the endometrium. The cut surface may appear white to yellow and may
show areas of necrosis or hemorrhage.
option C: Endometrial polyps are usually small and may be single or multiple. Grossly, they
appear as soft, red to pink, often pedunculated (attached by a stalk) masses protruding into the    uterine cavity. It presents with heavy cyclic or intermenstrual bleeding, or without complaints as an incidental finding on imaging. Estrogen and progesterone have been implicated in the growth of endometrial polyps, and higher receptor levels are seen compared with the normal
endometrium.
option D: In Adenomyosis (Endometriosis interna), the uterus may appear bulky and
symmetrically enlarged. on the cut section, the myometrium may appear thickened and may show tiny cystic spaces filled with old blood (chocolate cysts). The preferred treatment is hysterectomy.  Localised excision or levonorgestrel IUCD is tried in younger women.

Q3,The ligament that maintains anteversion of the uterus during pregnancy is:,"a)Round ligament
b)cardinal ligament
c)uterosacral ligament
d)pubocervical ligament","The round ligament helps maintain the anteversion of the uterus during pregnancy.
However, the anteversion in the non-pregnant uterus is maintained by both the uterosacral ligament and round ligament.
Anteflexion of uterus is at the level of internal os.
(Mnemonic - V for version, V for vagina)
The uterus normally lies in a position of anteversion and anteflexion.
In anteversion, the external os is directed downward and backward, so that on vaginal examination, the fingers find that the lowest part of the cervix is the anterior lip.
when the uterus is retroverted, the cervix is directed downward and forward, and the lowest part of the cervix is either the external os or its posterior lip.

Q4,Quadruple testing is done during:,"a)9-11 weeks
b)12-14 weeks
c)15-2o weeks
d)22-28 weeks","The quadruple screening test is ideally done in the second trimester, during 15-2o weeks of gestation. The most accurate values are seen during 16-18 weeks of gestation.
It is the measurement of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP), unconjugated estriol, hcG, and inhibin-A.
In Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) or Edward's syndrome (trisomy 18), quadruple-marker
screenings do not provide any added benefit over first-trimester screenings. It is generally used as a stand-alone test if screening is done for the first time in the second trimester or if first-trimester screening is not available.

Q5,what is the ideal number of antenatal visits?,"a)12-14
b)6-8
c)7-9
d)1o-11","The ideal number of antenatal visits is 12-14.
The antenatal visits should ideally be: monthly once up to 28 weeks, once in two weeks between 28-36 weeks, and once weekly visits from 36 weeks onwards.
This translates to a total of 12-15 visits.
The WHO increased the minimum number of antenatal visits from 4 to 8 visits to reduce perinatal mortality.
In the Indian scenario, the earlier minimum of 4 visits were implemented as follows:
• 1st visit: within 12 weeks (preferably as soon as pregnancy is suspected)
• 2nd visit: between 14-26 weeks
• 3rd visit: between 28-34 weeks
• 4th visit: between 36 weeks and term
A booked case is one that has at least 3 antenatal visits with two visits in the third trimester.",,A,
Q6,A woman is diagnosed to be positive for HIV in her first trimester. what is the appropriate management?,"a)start ART immediately and continue till 6 weeks after delivery
b)start ART after 1st trimester and continue life-long
c)start ART immediately and continue life-long
d)start ART after 1st trimester and continue till 6 weeks after delivery","ART should be initiated immediately and continued lifelong in all pregnant and breastfeeding women with HIV. This is regardless of their WHO clinical stage and CD4 cell count.
*Note: pearl attached below has been updated according to the NACO ART guidelines 2021.
Efavirenz has been replaced by Dolutegravir as per the new guidelines.",,C,
Q7,The fate of the Mullerian duct is determined by the:,"a)X chromosome
b)Y chromosome
c)1st chromosome
d)2nd chromosome","The fate of the Mullerian duct is determined by the presence or absence of the Y chromosome as follows:
• In presence of the Y chromosome, the SRY gene (Sex-determining Region of the Y chromosome) produces the protein called the testis determining factor which leads to the gonads developing as



the testes. The Sertoli cells of the testis will then produce a peptide hormone, the Müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS), also known as Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), and cause the    Müllerian ducts to regress.
• In absence of the Y chromosome and the SRY gene consequently, the gonads will develop as
ovaries and the Mullerian duct will differentiate into the fallopian tubes and the upper part of the vagina. The WNT4 gene on the 1st chromosome promotes female sex development.",,B,
Q8,which of the following is the first step after fitting the pessary to check if the pessary is adequately retained?,"a)Asking the patient to void and see if the pessary is in place
b)seeing if the patient feels any discomfort, which means that the pessary is retained
c)Asking the patient to perform the valsalva manouvre and see if the pessary is in place
d)Being able to admit two fingers between the ring and the pessary.","The first step after fitting the pessary to check if the pessary is adequately retained is to ask the patient to perform valsalva's maneuver or cough and see if the pessary is in place.
There is some level of descent of the pessary with these maneuvers is to be expected, but the pessary should return to its normal position when these efforts are stopped. If the pessary
descends to the introitus with these maneuvers, then a larger size pessary should be tried.
The pessary is well-fitted if you are able to slide the ring of the pessary up and down along the
vaginal sidewall. It is well-fitted if you are able to insert one finger between the vaginal sidewall     and the edge of the pessary. When the labia are separated, a well-supported pessary is not usually visible.
The patient should be comfortable, and able to void urine with the pessary in place before leaving the clinic.",,C,5913-3714.PNG
Q9,A pregnant woman presents with obstructed labor and is grossly dehydrated. Investigations reveal fetal demise. what will be the management?,"a)craniotomy
b)Decapitation
c)cesarean section
d)Forceps extraction","The best management in the given clinical scenario is cesarean section.
obstructive labor management involves administering intravenous fluids to correct dehydration, providing antibiotics to prevent infection, and promptly performing a cesarean section to relieve



the obstruction. If the fetus is alive, an immediate cesarean section is typically performed.
Management of obstructed labor never involves a wait-and-watch approach or augmenting with oxytocin.
clinical features of obstructed labor include maternal exhaustion, dehydration, tachycardia, tachypnea, genital sepsis, postpartum hemorrhage, and shock.
on P/A examination the upper uterine segment is tender and tonically contracted. The lower uterine segment is thin and stretched. A groove/depression is felt between the upper uterine  segment and the lower uterine segment. This is called a Bandls ring.
complications of obstructed labor include rupture of the uterus and vesicovaginal fistula.",,C,
Q10,The best time to identify the type of twin pregnancy on ultrasound is:,"a)18-22 weeks
b)24-28 weeks
c)11-14 weeks
d)14-18 weeks","The best time to identify the type of twin pregnancy on ultrasound is 11-14 weeks.
Twin pregnancies should ideally be dated when the crown–rump length (cRL) measurement is between 45 and 84 mm (i.e. 11 + o to 13 + 6 weeks of gestation).
chorionicity should be ideally determined between 11 + o and 13 + 6 weeks of gestation (the
earliest time to identify chorionicity is 7 weeks). This is done using the membrane thickness at the site of insertion of the amniotic membrane into the placenta. The T■sign (in monochorionic
twins) or lambda sign (in dichorionic twins) can be seen here. As the determination of chorionicity is most accurate when the amnion and chorion have not yet been fused, the first■trimester scan    in twin pregnancy is highly important.
Markers of dichorionicity include 4 layers of membranes between the twins, membrane thickness &gt;2mm, different sex of twins, 2 different placentas, and positive twin peak sign.
women with an uncomplicated dichorionic twin pregnancy should have a first■trimester scan, a detailed second■trimester scan, and scans every 4 weeks thereafter.
women with uncomplicated monochorionic twins should have a first■trimester scan and then    scans every 2 weeks from 16 weeks onwards. This is done in order to detect TTTS and TAPS in a timely manner.",,C,
Q11,which of the following statements is false about the umbilical cord?,"a)It has one artery and two veins
b)It contains a gelatinous substance called whartonls jelly
c)presence of a single umbilical artery is associated with congenital anomalies
d)Normal average umbilical cord length is 5o-6o cms","The umbilical cord normally has two arteries and one vein. The presence of a single umbilical artery is the most common vascular anomaly of the cord. It is associated with congenital
anomalies such as genitourinary and cardiac anomalies.
The umbilical cord is a tube that connects the fetus to the placenta. It contains umbilical vessels    and an obliterated allantois duct, all surrounded by wharton's jelly and contained within an outer layer of amnion. Maternal blood enters the fetus through the umbilical vein, and blood exits the     fetus via the two umbilical arteries. wharton's jelly is a gelatinous mucopolysaccharide that
protects the umbilical vessels. Local collections of wharton's jelly produce false knots in the cord.



The average length of the umbilical cord is between 4o-7o cm at term. A long cord can form a loop around the fetus' neck and can cause asphyxia. A short cord can result in cord rupture during
labor.",,A,
Q12,which of the following statements is false about non-invasive prenatal testing?,"a)It uses cell-free circulating fetal DNA in the maternal serum
b)It is used for the diagnosis of trisomy 13, 18 and 21
c)It can be performed after 1o weeks of gestation
d)It is done after the routine first trimester ultrasound assessment","Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is used for the screening of trisomy 13, 18 and 21 and Turner's syndrome. It is not a diagnostic test.
It is a novel genetic test that uses cell-free circulating fetal DNA in the maternal serum for screening of chromosomal anomalies.
DNA from the fetus is found circulating in the maternal blood in two forms - either inside the intact fetal cells or as cell-free DNA from the breakdown of placental fetal cells. In NIPT, the   cell-free chromosome fragments are measured and the quantitative differences from normal    fetuses are noted.
NIPT can be performed after 1o weeks of gestation and is recommended after the routine
first-trimester ultrasound assessment in high-risk pregnancies or if either 1st or 2nd-trimester screening becomes positive. Its disadvantage is that it is very expensive and it can be used for  screening of only a few chromosomal anomalies such as trisomy 13, 18, and 21 and it doesn't   analyse the entire karyotype.",,B,
Q13,which of the following is not a cause of secondary ppH?,"a)Retained cotyledon
b)Endometritis
c)placental polyp
d)placenta previa","Placenta previa does not cause secondary postpartum hemorrhage. It causes primary postpartum hemorrhage.
Types of PPH:
Primary/early: Hemorrhage occurring within 24 hours of childbirth.
secondary/ late: Hemorrhage occurring after 24 hours and up to 12 weeks postpartum.

Q14,A 16-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea has the following features. what is the most probable diagnosis?,"a)Testicular feminizing syndrome
b)Gonadal dysgenesis
c)kallmann syndrome
d)Turner syndrome","The scenario of a 16-year-old girl with absent secondary sexual characters, normal stature, with
XX karyotype and high FsH and LH is suggestive of pure gonadal dysgenesis.
46 XX and 46 Xy gonadal dysgenesis without the phenotype of Turner's syndrome (short stature, webbed neck) is described as pure gonadal dysgenesis. It is characterized by the presence of
primary amenorrhea with or without normal secondary sexual characteristics.
option A: Testicular feminizing syndrome occurs in karyotype Xy. secondary sexual characters are present and the uterus is absent.
option C: kallmann syndrome is a form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. GnRH synthesis is reduced, therefore FsH and LH are low, and secondary sexual characters are absent.
option D: Turner syndrome is associated with short stature and karyotype Xo. secondary sexual characters and the uterus is present, but the ovaries are streaked.",,B,5917-3717.PNG;5917-3716.PNG
Q15,Fimbriectomy is also known as:,"a)pomeroy technique
b)uchidals procedure
c)kroenerls procedure
d)Irvingls procedure","Fimbriectomy is also known as kroener's procedure. This procedure involves ligation of the distal ampulla of the tube with two permanent sutures. Then, resection ofthe infundibulum of the tube  is done.





some more techniques of permanent sterilization include:
pomeroy method - The fallopian tube is identified on each side, brought out through the incision. The middle portion is formed into a loop which is tied at the base with catgut and excised. This is the most commonly used technique.


uchida's method - The tubal serosa is stripped off the muscular layer in the midsegment of the   tube. The muscle layer is excised. The proximal end is ligated and buried in the broad ligament. This minimal excision of the tube preserves the potential for tuboplasty.





Irvingls procedure - The mid-portion of the tube is ligated and the intervening portion is excised.   The proximal end is buried in the myometrium and the distal end is buried in the broad ligament. It is a reliable method but irreversible and may require a laparotomy incision.


Madlenerls procedure - A loop of the fallopian tube is crushed and then ligated with a nonabsorbable suture.",,C,5918-3719.PNG;5918-3718.PNG;5919-3721.PNG;5919-3720.PNG;5920-3722.PNG

b)only 3
c)2 and 3
d)3 and 4","Albumin and IgM cannot cross the placenta.
High molecular weight substances such as proteins (e.g., albumin, IgM, IgA) cannot cross the placenta, except IgG.
substances which can cross the placenta are as follows:
Note: Maternal hormones like insulin, steroid hormones, and thyroid hormones cross the placenta very slowly, and only in amounts enough to support fetal development. However, calcitonin and     parathormone do not cross the placenta.

Q17,when is dilatation and curettage contraindicated?,"a)pelvic inflammatory disease
b)Ectopic pregnancy
c)Menstrual irregularities
d)Endometriosis","Dilatation and curettage (D&amp;c) is contraindicated in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) as it increases the risk of ascending genital infection.
D&amp;c is a minor gynecological procedure of dilating the cervix and curetting the endometrial tissue from the uterine cavity. Diagnostic indications of D&amp;c include AUB, secondary
amenorrhea to detect tubercular endometritis, postmenopausal bleeding to rule out endometrial cancer or hyperplasia, and infertility due to genital TB.
Therapeutic indications of D&amp;c include missed abortion, incomplete abortion, retained products of conception, and endometrial polypectomy.
Absolute contraindication of D&amp;c includes suspected/ desired pregnancy and lower genital    tract infection. However, D&amp;c is performed in some cases with genital infections like septic   abortion (where retained pieces of placenta act as a nidus and need to be removed) and pyometra (as there is cervical obstruction with superinfection of menstrual blood and cellular debris,
D&amp;c is appropriate to remove the obstruction as well as the source of infection)
complications of D&amp;c include ascending infection, cervical tear with bleeding, incompetent os, uterine perforation, and ashermann syndrome.",,A,5921-3723.PNG
Q18,A 45-year-old lady complains of post-coital bleeding. she has a positive pap smear. what is the next line of management?,"a)colposcopy directed biopsy
b)cone biopsy
c)Repeat pap smear
d)Hysterectomy","The appropriate management of a 45-year-old with a positive pap smear and post-coital bleeding is a colposcopy-directed biopsy.
A per speculum examination must be done whenever a female comes with post-coital bleeding in order to evaluate for carcinoma of the cervix. If growth is visible, a punch biopsy should be done, and else if no growth is visible, then a pap smear is done. A pap smear is a screening test for
cervical cancer. The presence of abnormal cells/ a positive test requires further evaluation by



colposcopy, cervical biopsy, or fractional curettage.
Cervical cancer screening should start at age 21. women aged 21-29 should have a pap smear every 3 years, while women aged 3o-65 should have both HPV and pap co-test every 5
years. women should stop having cervical cancer screening after the age of 65 years. If a pap
smear is suspicious, then screening is continued till 75 years. HIV+ve women should have annual checkups until three consecutive negative tests followed by testing every 3 years for life.
Pap testing should be done prior to vaginal examination. Lubricants should not be used and the patient should not be menstruating during the pap test. The patient should not have
intercourse 24hrs prior to the test. The ideal time is around ovulation.",,A,
Q19,"In superfecundation, which of the following is seen?","a)Fertilisation of 2 ova released at the same time by sperms released at single intercourse
b)Fertilisation of 2 ova released in the same cycle by sperms released at intercourse on 2 different occasion
c)Both of the above
d)None of the above","superfecundation is the fertilization of two different ova released in the same cycle, by
two separate acts of coitus within a short period of time.
superfecundation is the fertilization of two different ova in the same menstrual cycle (as
suggested by the same gestational age) by separate acts of coitus. It can occur even after artificial reproductive therapy. Hence, after embryo transfer, intercourse must be avoided. Heteropaternal superfecundation is used to refer to instances of two different males fathering fraternal twins.
This leads to the possibility of twins also being half-siblings. This may give rise to the doubt of adultery and infidelity.
superfetation is the fertilization of two ova released in different menstrual cycles. This is not seen in humans. The nidation and development of one fetus over another fetus is theoretically possible until the decidual space is obliterated by 14-16 weeks of pregnancy.",,B,
Q20,All are true regarding peripartum cardiomyopathy except _____,"a)Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction
b)Absence of identifiable cause
c)Dilated left ventricle","Left ventricular systolic dysfunction is a feature of peripartum cardiomyopathy (also known as postpartum cardiomyopathy) and not diastolic dysfunction.
Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a type of dilated cardiomyopathy. It develops during the last month of pregnancy or within the first 5 months following delivery.
The predisposing factors include Cardiac gene mutations involving several genes like TTNC1, TTN, and sTAT3, Twin pregnancy/ multifetal gestation, smoking, and Preeclampsia. other     proposed causes include viral myocarditis, abnormal immune response to pregnancy,
malnutrition, inflammation, etc.
PPCM is associated with increased secretion of prolactin by the pituitary and antiangiogenic molecule sFlt-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase) by the placenta at term gestation.
Pearson’s diagnostic criteria for PPCM:
• Development of cardiac failure in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months after delivery
• Absence of an identifiable cause for the cardiac failure
• Absence of recognizable heart disease prior to the last month of pregnancy, and



• Left ventricular systolic dysfunction demonstrated by echocardiographic criteria, such as     ejection fraction &lt;45% or fractional shortening &lt;3o% along with a dilated left ventricle.
Management involves treating the features of heart failure. Bromocriptine has been found useful  in this condition. Many women recover within 6 months of delivery, while some continue to have residual effects.",,B,
Q21,which of the following is not the mechanism of action of progesterone only pills?,"a)Thicken the cervical mucus
b)prevents ovulation
c)kills the sperms in the cervical canal
d)Inhibits penetration of sperm","Minipills or progesterone-only pills (pop) do not kill sperm in the cervical canal.
progesterone-only pills act by thickening the cervical mucus (the main mechanism of all pops   except cerazette) that inhibits penetration of sperms, inhibiting tubal motility, and suppressing ovulation.
other advantages of pops include a reduction in the incidence of pelvic inflammatory diseases and sexually transmitted diseases (due to thickened cervical mucus).
Due to the inhibition of tubal motility, the absolute risk of all pregnancies including ectopic
pregnancy decreases, while the relative risk of ectopic pregnancy increases. But a previous history of ectopic pregnancy is not a contraindication for pop.
pops do not affect clotting, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. so they can safely be used by women who are obese, breastfeeding, hypertensive, have sLE or a history of
thromboembolism, diabetic with vascular disease. significant adverse effects of pops are irregular bleeding (mostly scanty), and secondary amenorrhea after longtime usage as it causes endometrial atrophy.
contraindications for pops include undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, pregnancy, known or suspected breast cancer, and benign or malignant liver tumors.",,C,
Q22,which of the following is not considered as a factor for a high-risk pregnancy?,"a)obesity
b)polyhydramnios
c)Anaemia
d)previous manual removal of placenta","previous manual removal of the placenta does not indicate a high-risk pregnancy.
The high-risk pregnancies according to the pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring system by the cDc are:

Q23,Long-standing pelvic inflammation may lead to which of the following conditions?,"a)pyometra
b)uterine polyposis
c)pseudocyesis
d)Endometrial hyperplasia","Long-standing pelvic inflammation may lead to pyometra. This refers to the collection of pus in the uterine cavity.
The initial infection involves the cervix uteri and urethra which may extend to Bartholin glands,  skene glands, endometrium, and fallopian tubes. unilateral pain and swelling over the labia may be caused by the inflammation of the Bartholin glands.
Depending on the extent of tissue involved, pID can be classified into five stages
• stage I - Acute salpingitis without peritonitis - No adhesions
• stage II - Acute salpingitis with peritonitis - purulent discharge
• stage III - Acute salpingitis with superimposed tubal occlusion or tubo ovarian complex
• stage IV - Ruptured tubo-ovarian abscess
• stage V - Tubercular salpingitis
Long-standing pelvic inflammation may also lead to:
• Dyspareunia
• Infertility
• Ectopic pregnancy



• Formation of adhesions like hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx, tubo-ovarian abscess
• chronic pelvic pain
Note: chronic pelvic inflammation leads to dense adhesions between the uterus and the
appendages. Thus, it becomes difficult to define the uterus from the pelvic masses. They form a hard mass which is called the frozen pelvis.
The most common cause of the spread of PID: Ascending infection along with sperms
The only PID that does not spread with the sexual route is genital TB. It has a hematogenous spread.
The most common PID in virgin females is genital TB.
Investigation of choice in PID: Abdominal USG
The surest sign of salpingitis is pus extruding from the fimbrial end of the tube.",,A,
Q24,which among the following is the most common presentation of postpartum nerve injury?,"a)Facial palsy
b)wrist drop
c)Foot drop
d)claw hand","The most common postpartum nerve injury is an injury to the peroneal nerve causing foot drop.
The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is the most commonly injured nerve after vaginal delivery followed by femoral neuropathies.
obstetrical neuropathies are due to the pressure on branches of the lumbosacral nerve plexus
during labor. They can manifest as complaints of intense neuralgia or cramp-like pains extending down one or both legs as soon as the head descends into the pelvis. Footdrop can be secondary to injury at the level of the lumbosacral plexus, sciatic nerve, or common fibular (peroneal) nerve.     Injury of the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves may occur with cesarean delivery, which may manifest as an inguinal hernia and loss of sensation at the pubic region respectively.
Note: Since there are no options relating to intense neuralgia in the lower limb, foot drop becomes the best possible answer.",,C,
Q25,what is altered in thyroid profile throughout pregnancy?,"a)Free T3 level

c)Total T3 level
d)TSH level","Total T3 levels are altered throughout pregnancy.
Total T3 and total T4 increase due to stimulation of thyroid tissue by hcG (α-subunit of hcG is  similar to TSH) during the early period of gestation. However, there is no change in free T3 and T4 due to an increase in thyroid-binding globulin (TBG).
This leads to a transient fall in TSH (but remains in the normal range) during the early weeks of gestation. The level ofTSH becomes normal during the second and third trimesters.
The hormonal changes during pregnancy are as follows:

Increased	Decreased	Unchanged
Growth Hormone	LH (Luteinizing hormone)	FreeT3, T4




Increased	Decreased	unchanged
Insulin(due toinsulin resistan ce)	FSH (Follicle-stimulating hor mone)	TSH
prolactin	DHEAS (Di-hydro epiandrost erone)	ADH (Anti-  diuretic hormon e)
