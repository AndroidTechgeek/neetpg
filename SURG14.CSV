Q1,which of the following are extra-esophageal complications associated with GERD?,"a)1,2
b)2,3,4
c)1,2,3,4
d)3,4","Asthma, laryngitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and cough are all extra esophageal complications in gastroesophageal reflux disease(GERD)
Extraoesophageal symptoms of GERD are:
• chronic cough
• Laryngitis,
• Asthma
• Dental erosions (especially on the lingual and palatal tooth
surfaces).
• pulmonary fibrosis
• sinusitis
• pharyngitis
• Recurrent otitis media
Extraesophageal symptoms of GERD originate from the respiratory tract and include both
laryngeal and pulmonary issues These symptoms can arise through two mechanisms. The first
and most common mechanism involves proximal esophageal reflux and microaspiration of
gastroduodenal contents, which cause direct injury to the larynx and lower respiratory tract. The second mechanism involves distal esophageal acid exposure triggering a vagal nerve reflex,
leading to bronchospasm and cough, due to the shared vagal innervation of the trachea and esophagus.
The incidence of Barrett's esophagus is also more in patients with long term GERD, which in turn increases the risk of adenocarcinoma of esophagus.",,C,
Q2,A 25 year old male presented with difficulty in swallowing food and weight loss for past few    months. He also complains of regurgitation of undigested food and halitosis. Barium swallow was performed. what is the diagnosis?,"a)Achalasia cardia
b)Esophageal carcinoma
c)Barrett's esophagus
d)Esophageal stricture","The given complaints of difficulty in swallowing, weight loss, regurgitation of undigested food and halitosis along with the barium swallow showing bird beak appearance is suggestive of achalasia



cardia.
Achalasia is a primary esophageal motility disorder caused due to the degeneration of neurons in  the myenteric plexus of the esophagus. It is characterized by the absence of esophageal peristalsis and impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), thereby causing a functional
obstruction at the gastroesophageal junction.
The patients present with a triad of dysphagia, regurgitation, and weight loss. The dysphagia initially begins with liquid and then progresses to solid foods, halitosis is present due to the   accumulation of food. Patients may develop pneumonia, lung abscess, etc. at a later stage.
The initial diagnosis is made by barium swallow or endoscopy, which shows the presence of
dilated esophagus due to the constriction of the lower esophageal sphincter (bird beak
appearance). The gold standard test to confirm achalasia cardia is esophageal manometry. The findings are impaired lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation and absent peristalsis with   elevated LES pressure.
Management includes:
• Surgical esophagomyotomy.
• Non-surgical measures like sublingual nitroglycerin, nitrates, or calcium channel blockers.
• Injection of botulinum toxin
• Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM)",5111-3190.PNG,A,
Q3,The instruments shown below are used for which of the following procedures?,"a)orogastric tube insertion
b)chest tube drainage
c)percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
d)Flatus tube insertion","The instruments shown in the image is used to perform percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.
A standard endoscopy is performed to ensure that there are no contraindications to gastrostomy   insertion. The stomach is insufflated with air and direct percutaneous needle puncture made at a  point where the stomach abuts the abdominal wall. Lignocaine is infused on withdrawal. A trocar is inserted and a wire is passed into the stomach, which can be caught with a snare. The scope is   withdrawn, pulling the wire out through the mouth,at which point it is attached to the
gastrostomy tube. The gastrostomy is pulled through into the stomach and out through the track created by the trocar insertion.
The insertion of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube improves nutritional and
functional outcomes in patients who cannot maintain oral nutritional intake. PEG insertion is
often a preliminary step in the treatment of complex orofacial malignancies and can also be used to support nutrition in patients with various malignant, degenerative, or inflammatory diseases.
Procedure risks include bleeding, perforation,aspiration risk, dislodgment with peritoneal contamination, wound site infection and granulation.",5112-3191.PNG,C,
Q4,patients diagnosed with breast cancer are usually advised to undergo ER screening test. what is its significance?,"a)Diagnostic marker
b)prognostic marker
c)Monitoring biomarker
d)surrogate molecular marker","Estrogen receptor (ER) is used as a prognostic marker.



The term prognostic marker generally is used to describe molecular markers that predict
disease-free survival, disease- specific survival, and overall survival, whereas the term predictive marker often is used in the context of predicting response to certain therapies.
other options
option A: A diagnostic biomarker detects or confirms the presence of a disease or condition of interest, or identifies an individual with a subtype of the disease.
option C:when a biomarker can be measured serially to assess the status of a disease or medical condition for evidence of exposure to a medical product or environmental agent, or to detect an   effect of a medical product or biological agent, it is a monitoring biomarker
option D: The most common and serious error in evaluating biomarkers is assuming that a
correlation between a biomarker's level and a clinical outcome means the biomarker is a valid    surrogate. However, for a biomarker to be a valid surrogate, it must not only be correlated with the outcome but also explain the change in the clinical outcome.",,B,
Q5,"A 45-year-old female presents with recurrent episodes of right flank pain, hematuria, and a history of urinary tract infections. urine analysis shows alkaline urine with a pH of 8.o.
which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?","a)Triple phosphate stones
b)calcium oxalate
c)uric acid stones
d)Ammonium urate stones","The given clinical scenario and microscopic image showing coffin lid shaped crystals are   suggestive of triple phosphate stones. They are also known as staghorn or struvite stones.
This is caused due to infection with urea-splitting organisms, such as Proteus, klebsiella, serratia, or Enterobacter species.They are usually formed in alkaline urine.
staghorn calculi are radio-opaque stones that grow in a branching pattern along the pelvicalyceal system. The above organisms metabolize the urea into ammonium and bicarbonate. Increased
metabolism of urea results in alkalinity of the urine, and precipitation of magnesium, ammonium, and phosphate - resulting in the formation of struvite stones.
Complete removal of a staghorn calculus is essential, as any remaining fragments after treatment can lead to a rapid recurrence and continued presence of bacteriuria. Following the successful
removal of the infection stone, long-term chemoprophylaxis is required for several months.",5113-3192.PNG,A,
Q6,All of the following statements are true regarding wilm's tumour except?,"a)It presents most commonly as abdominal mass
b)Most common age of presentation is within 5 years
c)95% of patients live long term with radiotherapy and chemotherapy
d)Metastasis to lungs is rare and occurs late","option C is not true regarding wilms tumour. The standard treatment ofwilm's tumour involves a combination of chemotherapy and surgery.
wilms tumor is the most common primary malignant renal tumor in children, typically affecting children less than 5 years ( optionB). After neuroblastoma, it is the second most common
malignant abdominal tumor in childhood. It most commonly presents as an asymptomatic
abdominal mass. (option A) other findings include hypertension, abdominal pain, gross painless hematuria, and constitutional symptoms such as fever and weight loss.
CECT abdomen is used to identify the extent of the tumor, integrity of the other kidney, and
metastasis. wilms tumor is metabolically active and can concentrate fluorodeoxyglucose therefore PET/CT is also helpful to identify regional spread and metastatic lesions. A biopsy is discouraged   as it may lead to disease upstaging.



Treatment: surgery and chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy, are the mainstays of
treatment.
• Radical nephrectomy is the standard surgical procedure done. Routine sampling of the para-aortic, hilar, and paracaval lymph nodes should be done.
• Nephron-sparing nephrectomy is done for children with bilateral disease or with a solitary kidney. preoperative chemotherapy can be used in these cases to induce tumor shrinkage.
• The classical chemotherapy includes vincristine and dactinomycin with the addition of Adriamycin(Doxorubicin).
Despite certain adverse risk factors such as metastases, unfavorable histology and recurrent    disease, the prognosis for most children with wilms' tumor remains very positive. The overall survival rate for children with wilms' tumor is over 9o%.
The tumour can extend into the renal vein and vena cava and metastasises to lymph nodes and lung. But metastasis to lungs occur late in the disease. (option D)",,C,
Q7,what is the colour code in trauma triage for patients with life threatening conditions?,"a)Red
b)yellow
c)Green
d)Black","Red is the colour code for patients with life threatening conditions who need immediate medical care.
Triage includes rapid classification of the injured based on their injuries and the chances of
survival with prompt medical intervention. It provides maximum benefit to the greatest number of injured in a disaster situation. It lessens the burden on medical facilities.
The internationally accepted four-color coded system is used commonly. It includes:
• Red - High priority attention or transfer; critical, but likely to survive if treatment is given early
• yellow - Medium priority; critical, likely to survive if treatment is given within hours
• Green - Ambulatory patients; stable, likely to survive even if treatment is delayed for hours to days
• Black - Dead or moribund patients; Not breathing, pulseless, so severely injured that no medical care is likely to help",,A,
Q8,which of the following conditions is not a risk factor for the development of cholangiocarcinoma?,"a)Hepatitis B
b)Caroli disesase
c)primary sclerosing cholangitis
d)Infection with opisthorchis viverrini","while all the given options are associated with the causation of cholangiocarcinoma, hepatitis B in particular has an association with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and rarely extrahepatic while   all the other options are associated with both intra and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Hence it
is not as significantly associated with cholangiocarcinoma compared to the other options
cholangiocellular carcinomas (cccs) or cholangiocarcinomas are mucin-producing
adenocarcinomas of the biliary duct system that may originate in the liver and extrahepatic bile ducts. patients present with signs of obstructive jaundice associated with weight loss and
anorexia. Initial workup by ultrasound shows dilation of the intrahepatic biliary tree, but



definitive diagnosis requires visualisation of the biliary tree and MRCP or ERCP (biopsy possible) is preferred
Risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma:
• Chronic inflammatory conditions- PsC, oriental cholangiohepatitis,Hepatitis C infection
• Parasitic infections- opisthorchis viverrini, C. sinensis
• Congenital - Choledochal cysts, Caroli’s disease
• Chemical agents-  Thorium dioxide (Thorotrast), vinyl chloride, Dioxin, Asbestos",,A,
Q9,"A woman presented with ulcerative lesion over the breast associated with erythema of
surrounding skin and history of retraction of nipple. Biopsy revealed invasive ductal
carcinoma. According to 8th edition of AJCC classification, the patient can be classified under which stage?","a)stage cant be M1
b)stage IIIb
c)stage 4, if N1-N3
d)T4b","The patient presenting with ulcerative lesion with inflammatory signs can be classified as stage  IIIb. Inflammatory breast carcinoma (stage T4d) is characterized by the skin changes of brawny induration, erythema with a raised edge, and edema (peaud’orange) involving &gt;1/3rd of the     breast.
T4d in the TNM staging of carcinoma breast points toward a diagnosis of inflammatory breast carcinoma. It shows extensive invasion and proliferation of tumor cells. Inflammatory breast   cancer is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. The hallmark of this condition is the
overexpression of e-cadherin. This results in increased tumor cohesion and the formation of tumoral clumps which can result in emboli. It has a particularly poor prognosis.
In addition to anatomical staging, the eighth edition of the AJCC TNM staging system includes the histological grade, ER, PR, HER2/neu and ki-67 assessment, multigene testingwith oncotype
Dxand the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy to refine the prognostic information.",,B,
Q10,"A 35-year-old male had an episode of loss of consciousness subsequent to a head injury from a bike accident. upon awakening, he began experiencing severe headache and nausea. He
appears drowsy with a Glasgow Coma scale (GCs) score of 1o. one of his pupils is dilated and unresponsive. CT head given. what is the management?","a)Anticoagulants to prevent further clotting of blood
b)observe and serial monitoring in the ICU
c)osmotic diuresis to decrease intracranial pressure
d)Urgent surgical evacuation","The given scenario of a man with a head injury, unconsciousness, nausea, dilated and fixed pupils, and the CT finding of a lenticular hemorrhage also showing a mid-line shift is characteristic of an  extradural or epidural hemorrhage. urgent surgical evacuation of heamatoma by craniotomy is
the management.
Epidural hemorrhage/hematoma is an intracranial hemorrhage in which the hemorrhage is
between the dura and the skull. It classically occurs due to a tear of the middle meningeal artery,   following a fracture of the temporal bone. Management is by surgical evacuation of the hematoma or by ligation of the damaged middle meningeal artery
Clinically, patients with extradural hemorrhage typically present with an initial transient loss of consciousness. A lucid interval is then seen, which may be minutes to hours during which the
patient usually presents. Neurological deterioration then occurs following the lucid interval as the hematoma expands.
As the hematoma expands, compensation is exhausted with rapid deterioration. There is
contralateral hemiparesis, a reduced conscious level, and ipsilateral pupillary dilatation, the cardinal signs of brain compression and herniation. The prognosis for promptly evacuated



extradural hematoma, without associated primary brain injury is excellent.",5115-3193.PNG,D,
Q11,"A patient with papillary carcinoma thyroid underwent thyroidectomy. she developed
hoarseness of voice after surgery. which of the following steps in surgery could not have resulted in this complication?","a)Division of strap muscles
b)Dissection close to zuckerkandl tubercle
c)Dissection along triangle of Beahr
d)Ligation of superior thyroid vessels","The patient presenting with hoarseness of voice post thyroidectomy can be due to injury to
external laryngeal nerve or unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve. The step in thyroidectomy where it is least to happen is during division of strap muscles.
Recurrent laryngeal nerve is related to the posterior branch of the inferior thyroid artery near the lobes of the thyroid gland. Therefore, during surgery, Inferior thyroid artery is ligated close to the gland to avoid injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
Thyroid surgery may cause injury to both external and recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLN). During thyroidectomy surgeries, there might be unilateral or bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.   unilateral RLN injury may be asymptomatic but in a few may cause hoarseness of voice.
Bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy can also occur postoperatively. It causes dyspnea and   stridor but the voice is good. These cases required emergency tracheostomy. External laryngeal nerve injury is more common and could result in hoarseness of voice.
other options
option B: The RLN frequently passes immediately medial to the tubercle of zuckerkandl. In order to find and protect RLN during thyroid surgery, a careful, bloodless, and meticulous dissection
should be carried out around the tubercle.
option C: Beahrs’ triangle is bounded by common carotid artery as base, inferior thyroid artery superiorly and RLN as the lower arm of triangle. Recognizing the boundaries of the triangle
posterior to thyroid after retracting the ipsilateral thyroid lobe medially, helps in avoiding RLN injury.
option D: The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve courses along the cricothyroid
muscle just medial to the superior pole vessels. To avoid injury to this nerve, the superior pole
vessels are divided individually as close as possible to the point where they enter the thyroid gland",,A,
Q12,which is the most common hernia in females?,"a)Indirect inguinal
b)Direct inguinal
c)Femoral
d)obturator","The most common hernia in females is an indirect inguinal hernia.
Inguinal hernia is the most common hernia in men and women. It is classified into :
• Indirect hernia - protrusion of the contents occurs through the deep inguinal ring, along with the spermatic cord, lateral to the inferior epigastric artery. It is the most common subtype of groin
hernia in both males and females.
• Direct inguinal hernia - occurs through the posterior wall of the inguinal canal through the Hasselbach's triangle. The sac is medial to the inferior epigastric artery.
other options:



option C: Femoral hernia occurs when the hernial sac descends vertically through the femoral    canal up to the saphenous opening and then escapes out into the loose areolar tissue. It is more common in women than in men; however, it is less common than inguinal hernia.
option D: In an obturator hernia, the contents pass through the obturator canal. It is more commonly seen in females than males; however, it is less common than inguinal hernia.
Note: Inguinal hernias are five times more common than femoral hernias.",,A,
Q13,which of the following is not done during the primary survey in trauma management?,"a)1, 3 and 4
b)3 and 4
c)1 only
d)1 and 3","NCCT brain is not done during the primary survey in trauma management. (option C)
Endotracheal intubation is part of airway management in the primary survey. Intercostal drainage for hemothorax or pneumothorax and chest X-ray especially AP view is part of breathing
component assessment of the primary survey in trauma management.
NCCT brain is a part of the secondary survey of trauma management and is performed after initial resuscitation and stabilisation. A CT scan of the head is performed within 1 hour if the GCS is
&lt;14 at the initial assessment. other indications include a tense fontanelle, suspicion of an open/ depressed or base of skull fracture, abnormal pupillary response, abnormal posturing, and a focal  neurological defect. A head CT scan should also be performed if there are three or more vomiting  episodes, a witnessed loss of consciousness or amnesia for &gt;5 minutes.",,C,
Q14,"A 45-year-old male arrived at the ER with altered mental status and hematemesis that began a day ago. He has a 2o-year history of alcoholism, with his most recent binge occurring a
week prior. An ultrasound revealed altered echo texture of liver and mild portal vein dilation. CT scan brain was normal. He was started on intravenous pantoprazole and antiemetics.
what should be the next step in his management?","a)start a course of broad spectrum antibiotics
b)order a liver biopsy to asses for fibrosis
c)perform an endoscopy to look for varices
d)Administer intravenous fluids and electrolyte replacement","The next immediate step in managament of upper gastrointestinal bleeding is administration of intravenous fluids and electrolyte replacement.
USG findings and history of alcoholism are suggestive of cirrhosis leading to portal hypertension.  The upper GI endoscopy provides a definitive diagnosis and aids in predicting the risk of bleeding with an option to treat via band ligation or sclerotherapy. (option C)
The management of esophageal variceal bleeding involves:
• Resuscitation with IV fluids, airway protection(intubation to protect airway and prevent aspiration), and oxygen
• Blood transfusion to maintain Hb between 7-9g/dL
• Antibiotic prophylaxis with ceftriaxone before endoscopy (option A)
• An attempt at hemostasis with octreotide or terlipressin or vasopressin
• Upper GI endoscopy within 12 hours after fluid resuscitation to confirm the source of the bleed
• Endoscopic variceal band ligation or sclerotherapy
• In case, of failure or rebleeding - Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)",,D,5131-3197.PNG
Q15,"A 23-year-old female presented with complaints of neck swelling, difficulty swallowing, and    hoarseness of voice. Radiological evaluation revealed a mass compressing the trachea. Biopsy showed cells arranged in nests with amyloid deposits. what is the origin of these cells?","a)Follicular cells
b)parafollicular cells
c)Hurthle cells
d)Ashkanazy cells","The clinical scenario along with biopsy showing cells arranged in nests along with amyloid
deposits is suggestive of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MTC) arises from the parafollicular C cells.
Histopathology shows polygonal to spindle-shaped cells which form nests, trabeculae, or follicles.  Amyloid deposits that are derived from the altered calcitonin molecules are present in the stroma. Calcitonin in the tumor cells and stroma is easily demonstratable by immunohistochemistry.
Features of MTC:
• painful neck mass with cervical lymphadenopathy
• Dysphagia, dysphonia, or dyspnea if there is local invasion
• Diarrhea due to increased intestinal motility
• Cushingoid habitus due to ectopic ACTH production
• Blood-borne metastasis
Diagnosis is by careful family history, physical examination, raised calcitonin and CEA levels, and fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the mass.
other options:
option C and D: A Hurthle cell is a cell in the thyroid that is often associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis as well as benign and malignant tumors (Hürthle cell adenoma and Hürthle cell
carcinoma). Ashkanazy cells are another name given to the cells with Hurthle bodies in Hashimoto's thyroiditis.",,B,5131-3197-1.png
Q16,"A 34-year-old male, on investigation serum calcium level of 12.8 mg/dl (N- 8.5-1o.25mg/dl)    with raised pTH. on ultrasonography, a 1.5x1.5 mass was detected on the right lower lobe of



the thyroid gland. which of the following is true regarding this condition?","a)A normal DEXA scan rules out the need for surgery
b)MIBI followed by focussed parathyroidectomy to be done
c)No surgery is required, only surveillance
d)Creatinine clearance &gt;8oml/min mandates surgery","The lab reports of this patient, associated with a thyroid mass indicate primary
hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid adenoma. MIBI followed by focused parathyroidectomy to be done in this condition.
The patient presents with hypercalcemia (serum calcium 12.8 mg/dL) and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH), which strongly indicates primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).
The ultrasonographic finding of a mass in the right lower lobe of the thyroid is consistent with a parathyroid adenoma, the most common cause of PHPT.
99mTc-sestamibi (MIBI) scan is commonly used in conjunction with ultrasonography to localise the hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland before surgery.
Focused parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice in such cases when a single adenoma is identified. This approach is minimally invasive and guided by the imaging findings.
other options
option A: A normal DEXA scan does not negate the need for surgery in a patient with severe
hypercalcemia like this. severe hypercalcemia (&gt;12 mg/dL) is an absolute indication for surgery, irrespective of the results of the DEXA scan.
option C: observation is only appropriate for patients with mild hypercalcemia, no symptoms, and no target organ damage. severe hypercalcemia (&gt;12 mg/dL) is an absolute indication for surgery.
option D: Creatinine clearance &lt; 6o ml/min mandates surgery.",,B,
Q17,"A middle-aged woman presents with flank pain and painful micturition. The pain was
relieved by IV analgesics given at a nearby primary healthcare centre. The patient is

• Head injury
• Salivary gland stones",,A,
Q18,Identify the marked structure.,"a)Corpora amylacea
b)Corpora arenacea
c)Lewy body
d)Psammoma bodies","The marked structure represents Corpora amylacea.
Corpora Amylacea are small, rounded, eosinophilic structures composed of glycoproteins and carbohydrates, commonly found in glandular tissues such as:
• prostate: Seen in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BpH), within prostatic acini.
• Astrocytic processes of the CNS, associated with aging or neurodegenerative diseases.
Clinical Significance:
• Generally benign and age-related in both the prostate and CNS.
• In CNS, linked to diseases like multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s.
other options:

Q20,"A 2o-year-old male presents with acute epigastric pain and fever. He has a past history of
cholelithiasis. on examination, abdominal guarding and rigidity present. His serum amylase, lipase are raised and patient has leucocytosis. what is true regarding his condition?","a)serum amylase remains elevated even after 3o days of resolution of acute pancreatitis
b)serum lipase is more specific than serum amylase
c)&gt; 75 percent patients present with hypercalcemia
d)Increase in the level of serum lipase is directly proportional to the severity","The patient presents with features suggestive of acute pancreatitis (epigastric pain, fever, history of cholelithiasis, guarding/rigidity, raised serum amylase and lipase, and leukocytosis). For acute pancreatitis, serum lipase is more specific than serum amylase.
Lipase has a higher specificity for diagnosing acute pancreatitis, as elevated amylase can occur in other conditions such as salivary gland disorders, intestinal obstruction, or renal failure. Lipase    also remains elevated longer than amylase.
The diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis require at least two of the following three features:
• Characteristic Abdominal pain:



Acute onset of severe epigastric pain, often radiating to the back.
pain may worsen after eating and is associated with nausea and vomiting.
• serum Lipase and/or Amylase Elevation:
At least 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).
Lipase is preferred due to its higher specificity and longer half-life.
• Imaging Findings:
Characteristic findings of pancreatitis on imaging (CT scan, MRI, or ultrasound), such as:
pancreatic enlargement
peripancreatic fluid collections
Inflammatory changes in and around the pancreas other options:
option A: Amylase levels normalize within 3-5 days after an episode of acute pancreatitis.
option C: Hypocalcemia is more commonly observed, due to fat saponification in severe cases. option D: The degree of elevation of serum lipase does not correlate with the severity of acute  pancreatitis. severity is assessed using clinical scores like Ranson's criteria, ApACHE II, or CT

In the given scenario:
• 6 x 4 cm mass - T3
• Ipsilateral Level I and Level II matted axillary lymph nodes- N2



• No distant metastasis - Mo.
In tumour size assessment, the greatest dimension is taken into consideration. For example, in a 6 x 4 cm lump, 6 cm is taken into account, and the tumour is classified as T3 (&gt;5 cm). If 2 lumps  are present in the same breast, staging is according to the bigger lump. If lumps are present in
bilateral breasts, separate staging is done for both lumps.
Any contralateral lymph node involvement is considered as distant metastasis.",,B,
Q22,"An 84-year-old man with a history of stroke 2 years ago, who is on prolonged bed rest,
develops a pressure ulcer with partial thickness skin loss and a clean base. what is the grade of his pressure sore?","a)Grade 1
b)Grade 4
c)Grade 3
d)Grade 2","The pressure sore is of grade 2 in this case.
Grade 2 of bedsore corresponds to partial-thickness skin loss involving the epidermis and dermis.
pressure sores, also known as bedsores, pressure ulcers, or decubitus ulcers, are defined as tissue necrosis with ulceration due to prolonged pressure. when the external pressure exceeds the
capillary occlusive pressure, blood flow ceases leading to tissue anoxia, necrosis, and ulceration. An external pressure of &gt;3o mmHg leads to the formation of pressure sores.
The common sites of pressure sores in decreasing frequency are the ischium, greater trochanter, sacrum, heel, malleolus (lateral followed by medial), and occiput.
Given below are images showing the stages of pressure sore.


prevention is the best treatment for pressure sores. They can be prevented with good skincare, the use of air-fluidized beds, special pressure-dispersion cushions, or foams. Fecal or urinary
diversion can be considered in special cases.
The position of the bedridden patients should be changed once every 2 hours and wheel-chair bound patients should be taught to get off their chairs for 1o seconds every 1o minutes.
surgical management of pressure sores follows the same principles involved in acute wound
treatment. prior to the operation, the pressure sores should be adequately debrided, and
vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) can be used to promote the growth of granulation tissue required



for surgical closure. Large skin flaps that have muscle with sensory innervation are best for reconstruction.
VAc is done by applying intermittent negative pressure of approximately -125 mmHg to hasten
debridement and promote granulation tissue formation. Negative pressure decreases edema,
removes interstitial fluid, and increases blood flow. This decreases bacterial growth and increases cell proliferation.",,D,5136-3201.PNG
Q23,"During ward rounds, you see a patient who is admitted with a ca esophagus. what is the most likely presentation in this patient?","a)Dysphagia of solids followed by liquids
b)Dysphagia of liquids followed by solids
c)chest pain
d)Neck mass","Dysphagia of solids followed by liquids is the most likely presentation in a patient with ca esophagus.
Initially, patients have difficulty swallowing solids. Later, as the tumor grows and narrows the    esophageal lumen, dysphagia progresses to liquids. This progression occurs because solid foods require a wider lumen to pass through, and the narrowing caused by the tumor becomes more   critical as it advances.
carcinoma esophagus is one of the most common malignancies manifesting in mid to late adulthood. It can be a squamous cell or adenocarcinoma.
squamous cell carcinoma (scc) affects the upper two-thirds ofthe esophagus while
adenocarcinoma affects the lower third. Tobacco smoking and alcohol are the risk factors for scc. obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease increase the risk of adenocarcinoma.
Dysphagia can be the most common presenting feature but may present late. other features such as regurgitation, weight loss, vomiting, and odynophagia can be seen. Lymph node involvement    indicates a poor prognosis.
Endoscopy is the first line of investigation done. cT is useful to rule out metastasis. Endoscopic    ultrasonography is used to assess the depth of tumor invasion through the wall of the esophagus, adjacent organs, and lymph node metastasis.
Management options include radical esophagectomy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and palliative chemoradiation or endoscopic treatments.
other options
option B: Dysphagia of liquids followed by solids is typically seen in motility disorders, such as achalasia cardia, where there is functional obstruction rather than a mechanical obstruction.
option c: chest pain may occur in the cA esophagus, but it is not the most common presenting symptom. It usually arises in advanced cases or due to tumor invasion into surrounding

Q24,what is the T stage of this oral cavity tumour?,"a)T4a
b)T4b
c)T3
d)T2","This oral cavity tumour is stage T4a.



In the given image, the oral cancer involves the floor of the mouth as well as the lip (adjacent
structures). when adjacent structures are involved, the cancer meets the criteria for T4a disease. (resectable)
T4a is defined as ""moderately advanced local disease"" and includes tumors that invade floor of the mouth or the lip, and is resectable. These structures involve:
• Cortical bone (e.g., mandible or maxilla)
• Inferior alveolar nerve
• Floor of the mouth
• skin of the face (chin or nose)
The T staging for oral cavity tumors, based on the AJCC 8th edition, is as follows:
• T1: Tumor ≤ 2 cm in greatest dimension, no invasion of adjacent structures.
• T2: Tumor &gt; 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm in greatest dimension, no invasion of adjacent structures. (option A)
• T3: Tumor &gt; 4 cm in greatest dimension or minor invasion into structures such as the deep tongue muscle. (option C)
• T4a (Moderately advanced local disease): Tumor invades adjacent structures like cortical bone, inferior alveolar nerve, floor of the mouth, or skin (chin or nose).
• T4b (very advanced local disease): Tumor invades masticator space, pterygoid plates, skull base, or encases the internal carotid artery. (option B)
The gold standard investigation for oral cancer includes an incisional biopsy. An MRI is the imaging modality of choice for assessing primary extent. surgical management with
chemotherapy and adjuvant radiotherapy is the mainstay of management.",5119-3195.PNG,A,
Q25,"A 3o-year-old patient with peptic ulcer disease presents with abdominal pain that is not
responding despite treatment in multiple hospitals. He was found to have ulcers in the
jejunum and ileum. Gastric pH &lt; 2, and gastrin levels after adequate cessation of PPIs are 1o times the normal value. Identify the lesion present and the boundaries of the triangle
containing it.","a)Gastrinoma; triangle formed by common bile duct, junction of D2-D3, neck and body of pancreas
b)Insulinoma; triangle formed by cystic duct, junction of D2-D3, neck and body of pancreas
c)Gastrinoma; triangle formed by cystic duct, junction of D2-D3, neck and body of pancreas
d)Insulinoma; triangle formed by common bile duct, junction of D2-D3, neck and body of pancreas","The above clinical scenario of abdominal pain, ulcers in the jejunum and ileum, gastric pH &lt; 2, and elevated gastrin levels are suggestive of gastrinoma. It is commonly located in a triangle
formed by the cystic duct, junction of D2-D3, neck and body of pancreas.
Gastrinoma is a neuroendocrinal tumour characterized by gastrin hypersecretion, resulting in
gastrointestinal tract ulcers. It occurs more commonly in a sporadic pattern but can be associated with MEN-1 (multiple endocrine neoplasia-1) syndromes in the familial pattern.
Gastrinoma is most commonly located in the gastrinoma triangle (passaro's triangle) bounded by the lines connecting the:
• cystic duct
• the junction between the second and third parts of the duodenum
• the junction between the neck and the body of the pancreas





The most common presentations of gastrinoma are epigastric pain, diarrhoea, and peptic ulcers. The ulcers occur at typical locations (proximal duodenum) and atypical locations (distal
duodenum, jejunum). Duodenal ulcers are the most common. Gastrinoma if associated with
marked gastric acid production and recurrent peptic ulcer is called zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
Diagnosis:
The gastric pH &lt;2, basal acid output &gt;15 mEq/hr and serum gastrin concentration more than 1ooo pg/ml (normal is &lt;1oo pg/ml) confirm the diagnosis of gastrinoma. when the diagnosis is  in doubt (like gastrin levels 1oo-1ooo pg/ml), then a secretin test is performed. A secretin test is     considered positive when serum gastrin levels are more than 2oo pg/ml on secretin
administration and confirms the diagnosis of gastrinoma.
For localization of the tumour for surgical management, CT or MRI scans should be done first. If  the tumour is not localized on these scans, then somatostatin receptor scintigraphy or endoscopic ultrasound is done for better localization.",,C,5139-3202.PNG

Q27,"A 35-year-old male underwent surgery for an ileal perforation. Due to heavy contamination, only the sheath was closed, and the wound was left open. Daily wound washing was
performed, and the wound was closed on postoperative day 5. By which mechanism does wound healing occur in this case?","a)Primary intention
b)secondary intention
c)Tertiary intention
d)Quarternary intention","wound healing occurs by tertiary intention in this case. The wound is cleaned and left open for a few days. This allows soft tissues to drain and also ensures no infection is present before surgical closure can be done.
wound closure is categorized into primary, secondary, or tertiary:
primary closure is done for clean wounds with minimal tissue loss that are amenable to
approximation of wound edges. Healing occurs by primary intention. primary closure is ideally
performed within 6 to 8 hrs of trauma, but wounds in vascular areas (e.g. face) may be delayed to up to 24 hours after trauma.
secondary closure allows healing by secondary intention. The wound is left open to heal largely by the formation of granulation tissue and contraction. These wounds often have significant tissue
loss precluding tension-free approximation of edges, with devitalized edges. wound dressings are changed daily to aid in the formation of granulation tissue and subsequent contraction.
Tertiary closure, also known as delayed primary closure, results in a combination of healing by
primary and secondary intention. The wound is thoroughly irrigated, debrided, and left open for 2 to 5 days before surgical closure. It is used for wounds that are grossly contaminated without
significant tissue loss.",,C,
Q28,A 4o-year-old patient who is a known case of Hodgkin's lymphoma with a previous history of irradiation presents with right-sided thyroid swelling. FNAC reveals papillary carcinoma of     the thyroid and there is no lymph node involvement. what is the next step in management?,"a)Hemi-thyroidectomy
b)Hemi-thyroidectomy with modified radical neck dissection
c)Total thyroidectomy
d)Total thyroidectomy with modified radical neck dissection","Total thyroidectomy is performed in patients with radiation-induced differentiated thyroid cancers irrespective of their size.
Management of differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC)
Differentiated thyroid cancers include papillary thyroid cancer, follicular thyroid cancer, and hurtle cell cancer.
Hemithyroidectomy is performed for DTCs between 1-4 cm without extrathyroidal extension or evidence of metastatic disease.
However, total thyroidectomy is performed in the following scenarios
• Tumor at least 4 cm
• Gross extrathyroidal extension
• Evidence of metastatic disease
• Radiation-induced DTC
• Familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer
• Multifocal bilateral DTC.
Central neck dissection is done only in case of involvement of level VI nodes.
If level VI plus other lymph nodes are enlarged - then total thyroidectomy + central neck dissection + modified radical neck dissection is done.
In case of tumor size &gt;4cm (T3 &amp;T4), prophylactic central neck dissection is done.
Below is the TNM staging of differentiated thyroid carcinoma.
papillary carcinoma is the most common thyroid carcinoma. It is most common in
iodine-sufficient areas, among children, and in those exposed to ionizing radiation. It is more
common in women than men (2:1). Dysphagia, dysphonia, and dyspnea are associated with local invasion. It usually presents as a cold nodule on the scan.
Lymph node metastasis is common. Lateral aberrant thyroid denotes a cervical lymph node
invaded by papillary carcinoma. The most common sites of metastasis: lung &gt; liver &gt; bone &gt; brain. It has an excellent prognosis, with a 1o-year survival rate in excess of 95%.

Q29,one of your friends is teaching you about enhanced recovery after surgery. which of the following he states is incorrect?,"a)prolonged fasting is necessary
b)Epidural anaesthesia is recommended in laparoscopic surgery
c)Reduction of the hospital stay by 2-3 weeks
d)Beta-blockers are given after major surgery done under general anaesthesia to improve outcome","prolonged fasting is not necessary for enhanced recovery after surgery.
Early oral hydration and nourishment and avoidance of unnecessary IV fluid administration favors the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol.
ERAS is an approach designed to speed the clinical recovery of the patient and reduce the cost   and length of stay in the patient. It is achieved by optimizing the patient's health before surgery and then delivering evidence-based best care in the perioperative period.
It includes:
• preference of minimally invasive procedures (e.g. laparoscopic)over open procedures.
• Minimal perioperative starvation.
• preference for local or regional anesthesia, and adequate pain control with patient-controlled analgesia.
• Early removal of Ryles tube and early feeding techniques, rather than IV fluid administration.
• Early mobilisation planned physiotherapy.
• Discharge planning is started before the patient is admitted to hospital and involves support from stoma care nurses, physiotherapists etc.
other options:
option B: Epidural anaesthesia is recommended in laparoscopic surgery for pain management.
option C: Reduction of the hospital stay by 2-3 weeks: ERAS protocols do reduce hospital stay so as to plan for early discharge.
option D: Beta-blockers are given after major surgery done under general anaesthesia to improve  outcome: Beta-blockers may be used postoperatively in certain cases to control heart rate, manage perioperative stress, and improve outcomes, especially in high-risk cardiac patients.",,A,
Q30,"A chronic smoker comes with complaints of pain in his legs after walking 1oo meters. on examination, he has an absent pulse in the bilateral dorsalis pedis, anterior tibial, and
posterior tibial arteries, but no gangrene is present. Intermittent claudication is implicated. which of the following statements is true regarding this condition?","a)pain is more at night and sleep
b)Development of pain on the 1st step of walking
c)pain aggravated by standing and relieved by bending forward
d)pain develops after walking some distance and is relieved by rest","In intermittent claudication, pain develops after walking some distance and is relieved by rest. Intermittent(vascular) claudication is most commonly felt in the calf muscles because of the      involvement of the superficial femoral artery in chronic vascular occlusive disease.
Intermittent claudication is the debilitating cramp-like pain felt in the leg muscles due to reduced  blood flow and anaerobic metabolism brought on by peripheral arterial disease. It usually signifies mild to moderate chronic vascular occlusive disease. The pain is brought on by walking, not
present on taking the first step. Relieved by rest in both the standing and sitting positions, usually within 5 minutes (option A). The distance that a patient can walk without stopping is known as
claudication distance. It varies only slightly from day to day. The superficial femoral artery (7o%) is the most commonly affected artery by claudication and manifests as pain in the calf muscles.    Aorto-iliac occlusion may cause thigh or buttock claudication. Leriche's syndrome occurs due to    aortoiliac occlusion and presents with a triad of claudication, impotence, and absent femoral
pulses.
Boyd's classification of claudication:
• Grade I: patient complains of pain after walking. If the patient continues to walk, due to
increased blood flow in muscle and opening of collaterals metabolites causing pain are washed away and the pain subsides.
• Grade II: pain persists on continuing to walk; but can walk with effort.
• Grade III: The patient has to take rest to relieve the pain.
other options
option A: Rest pain occurs when the occlusive disease progresses in severity. Though this pain is present during the day, it is exacerbated on lying down at night due to loss of gravity-dependent  perfusion of the foot. This may be relieved by hanging the foot out of the bed to restore the
gravitational effects.
option B: The development of pain on taking the first step of walking is a classic sign of
osteoarthritis.
option C: pain aggravated by standing and relieved by bending forward is seen in neurogenic claudication. It may be seen in cases of nerve compression from lumbar intervertebral disc
prolapse or spinal stenosis.",,D,
Q31,"A 25-year-old male with a history of a road traffic accident is brought to the emergency
department. His GCs is 8/15, oxygen saturation is 85%, BP is 1oo/ 6o mmHg, and heart rate  is 6o beats per minute. on auscultation his right side breath sounds were absent. what is the next step in management?","a)secure airway, give oxygen, insert ICD, secure IV line
b)Administer IV dextrose followed by NCCT head
c)start IV fluids, give atropine and secure airway
d)Evaluate for head injury and do CT-head","The given clinical scenario of hemodynamic instability, decreased oxygen saturation (85%), GCS of 8/15 and absent breath sounds on the right side of the chest, with a history of a road traffic
accident are suggestive of tension pneumothorax. The next step of management in this case is to secure the airway, give oxygen, insert the ICD, and secure the Iv line.



According to the latest ATLS guidelines, the order of primary survey in a trauma patient is ABCDEF following the principle of ‘what kills first should be managed first’ -
• Airway
• Breathing
• Circulation with control of haemorrhage
• Disability(neurological)
• Exposure to environmental control
• Fluid resuscitation
After securing the airway, breathing can be assessed by auscultating for breath sounds and a chest X-ray to look for a pneumothorax or hemothorax. Administering oxygen through a bag and mask   is useful during desaturation only if the airway is patent. Therefore, securing the airway is the
most important next step for this patient.
Tension pneumothorax is mainly managed by inserting a wide-bore needle in the 5th intercostal    space (ICS) followed by placing an intercostal drain in the 5th ICS. once the airway and breathing are secured, hemodynamic instability must be corrected by securing an Iv line to maintain
circulation.
other investigations such as NCCT head and CT head are done later on during further evaluation in the secondary survey.",,A,
Q32,An elderly male patient comes with foul-smelling breath and dysphagia. A barium swallow X-ray is attached. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Achalasia cardia

c)Tracheoesophageal fistula
d)Carcinoma esophagus","The given clinical scenario of foul-smelling breath and dysphagia, and the given barium swallow X-ray showing the collection of contrast in a posterior pharyngeal pouch-like structure, are
suggestive of zenker's diverticulum.
It often presents with the following:
• Dysphagia
• Regurgitation
• Halitosis
• Gurgling sound on swallowing
• Aspiration
A barium swallow study may show a diverticulum arising from the midline of the posterior wall of the distal pharynx near the pharyngoesophageal junction. The diverticulum is typically noted at
the C5-6 level. The outpouching may be transient, sometimes referred to as a pharyngeal pouch. The pouch is best identified during swallowing and is best visualized on the lateral view.",5122-3196.PNG,B,
