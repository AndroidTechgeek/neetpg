Q5,"A study was conducted to assess the effect of an intervention for certain disease. The p values for two similar studies A and B with 95% confidence limits, was found to be o.o2 and o.oo1    respectively using interventions ""x"" and ""y"" with a control group. Based on preliminary
analysis, the result may be interpreted as:","a)IfA, B and C are correct
b)IfA and C are correct
c)If B and D are correct
d)If all (A, B, C and D) are correct","statements A and C are correct.
The p-value of study A with intervention X at 95% confidence interval is o.o2.
The p-value of study B with intervention Y at 95% confidence interval is o.oo1
The probability (p) values of both the studies are less than o.o5 (level of significance - α(alpha)). Therefore, both studies A, and B are significant, thus, rejecting the null hypothesis.
However, study B has a lower p-value compared to study A, which suggests that the study B with intervention Y is more significant and precise than study A with intervention X.",,B,
Q6,"In a study, group A received placebo while group B received a new drug. In group A, 36
deaths were reported out of a sample of 12o. In group B, 26 deaths were reported out of a sample size of 13o. How many patients should be treated to avert 1 death?","a)1oo
b)1o
c)25o
d)16o","1o patients need to be treated with the new drug to avert 1 death.
The number needed to treat (NNT) is defined as the number of individuals to be treated with the new drug to prevent 1 death (or to save 1 life).
NNT = 1oo/ARR
Where, ARR is the absolute risk reduction, which is the difference in the absolute risk rates
between the placebo group and drug group. The absolute risk is usually expressed in percentage. ARR = (No. of deaths/sample population) x 1oo
calculation:
step 1: calculation of absolute risk rate
The absolute risk rate in group A (placebo)
= (36/12o)x1oo
= 3o%
The absolute risk rate in group B (new drug)
= (26/13o)x1oo
= 2o%
step 2: calculation of absolute risk reduction (ARR)
ARR = Absolute risk rate in group A - Absolute risk rate in group B
= 3o - 2o
= 1o%
step 3: calculation of number needed to treat
NNT = 1oo/ARR
= 1oo/1o
= 1o
Therefore, 1o individuals need to be treated with the new drug to save 1 life.",,B,

Q10,Mass vaccination is most effective in which of■ the following outbreaks?,"a)cholera
b)Typhoid
c)polio
d)Measles","Mass immunization is effective in case of an outbreak of poliomyelitis.
The WHo has laid down standard operating procedures to be followed for responding to a poliovirus event or outbreak.
In the case of detection of an event or outbreak, the WHo recommends the following step-wise approach:
• Notification of the disease to international health regulations (IHR) focal point at the WHo regional centre.
• Detailed investigation and risk assessment.
• Enhanced surveillance to detect ongoing person-person transmission.
• vaccination response to reach every child.
The vaccination response includes:
• A rapid response (RR) vaccination campaign: This campaign is initiated with 14 days of the
laboratory sequencing result and targets the immediate area of the virus isolation to rapidly stop further transmission. The target population is about 2 lakh to 5 lakh children.
• Supplementary immunization activities (SIA): Two high-quality large-scale SIA
campaigns (SIA1and SIA2) are carried out, to ensure that &gt;9o% of children are vaccinated.
These campaigns should be completed within 8 weeks of laboratory sequencing result. The target population in the large scale rounds is about 2 million children.



• Mop-up round or additional SIAs: If the monitoring suggests that children have been missed in certain areas, then a mop-up round of immunization is done.
The target age group for immunization under SIAs is children less than five years of age. If there is evidence of virus circulation among older age groups, then the target age group can be
expanded to 1o or 15 years or even to the whole population depending on the local context.
other options:
options a: In case of a cholera outbreak, the mainstay of response includes health education on the role of hygiene, rehydration therapy, and sanitation measures.
option b: The mainstay of typhoid control in case of an outbreak includes health education, water quality and sanitation improvement, and training of health professionals in diagnosis and
treatment. Although WHo recommends immunization as a complementary method to the above measures, there is insufficient data to ascertain the effectiveness of vaccination in case of a
typhoid outbreak.
option d: In case of measles outbreak, the control measures include isolation for seven days after the onset of rash and immunization of the contacts within 2 days of exposure.",,C,

Q12,Look at the image below and select the linear regression equation corresponding to the graph.,"a)y=1o-x
b)x=1o+y
c)y=11+2x
d)x=11+2y","Among the given options, the equation y=11+2x corresponds to the linear regression equation of the form y=α + βx.
When 2 variables are correlated, such that the dependent variable is represented on the y-axis and the independent variable on the x-axis, then the value of y can be obtained by using the linear



regression equation y 〓 α + βx, where:
y - dependent variable

Q13,All of the following can be done to remove confounders except:,"a)Randomization
b)Blinding
c)Restriction
d)Matching","Blinding does not eliminate confounding factors. Blinding is done to eliminate the bias (such as subject bias, observer bias, or investigator bias).
A confounding factor is defined as the one associated with both exposure and disease and is distributed unequally in study and control groups.
• For example, a prospective study is being conducted to know the effect of alcohol on the development of lung cancer.
• However, individuals who drink alcohol are most likely to smoke. so, smoking is associated with the exposure. Also, smoking is an independent causative factor for lung cancer. Thus, smoking is a confounding factor.
• In the above example, if the study is conducted without eliminating the confounding factor, then the result may falsely suggest that alcohol is a causative factor for lung cancer.
Techniques to eliminate confounding factors include
• Randomization
• Matching
• stratified randomization
• Restriction
Randomization is the random allocation of the participants
in experimental studies (Ex.randomized control trial) into the study group and control group.
Matching, which is usually done in analytical studies (for example, case–control and cohort
studies), is the process where the participants in two groups are matched based on factors such as age, gender, race, smoking status, etc. to eliminate the potential confounders.
stratified randomization, which is also known as prestratification or blocking, is the process that  combines both randomization and matching techniques. In this method, the participants are first grouped into subgroups which internally match with potential confounding factors such as age,   race, gender, etc. An equal number of participants form each subgroup are then allocated to the    study and control groups.



Restriction: This method restricts the study to only those participants with particular
characteristics. For example, a study can be restricted to participants of only one gender, race, age group, geographical area, disease severity, etc., thus eliminating the potential confounders.",,B,
Q14,"A study was done to assess the risk factors for breast cancer in 1oo females from urban cities. A statistical group and analysis are shown below. The values indicate the odds ratio and the    95% confidence interval. How many risk factors may be ascertained from the statistical
analysis of the research?","a)3
b)4
c)5
d)6","Among the factors shown in the above statistical group, the odds ratio of early menarche,
BRCA mutation, and obesity show positive association and are statistically significant. Hence these 3 factors can be ascertained as risk factors.
High socioeconomic status is not a risk factor. Even though there is a positive association, it is not statistically significant. Any association that has a 95% confidence interval range that includes the value of 1.o is considered to be non-significant. The value of 1.o in the range means that the two     factors may co-exist together but one is not causing the other to happen.
Odds ratio (OR) is the key parameter in case-control studies to assess the strength of association between the exposure and outcome. The interpretation of the odds ratio can be done as below:
• OR &gt; 1 indicates a positive association. If both upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence   limits are also &gt;1, it suggests that the odds ratio is significant and the factor can be ascertained as a risk factor.
• OR = 1indicates no association. Irrespective of the odds ratio, if the lower limit of 95% CI is &lt;1 and the upper limit of 95% CI &gt;1, the OR is non-significant and cannot be ascertained either as a protective or a risk factor.
• OR &lt; 1 indicates a negative association. If both upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence  limits are also &lt;1, it suggests that the odds ratio is significant and the factor can be ascertained as a protective factor.
Interpretation of the individual factors given in the question:

Q15,"In a town of 2o,ooo populations, total 456 births were there in a year out of which 56 were dead born. The total death were 247 out of which 56 deaths were within 28 days of life and



another 34 had dies after 28 days and before completing the first birthday. calculate the infant mortality rate of the area?","a)197
b)392
c)225
d)344","The infant mortality rate is 225 per 1ooo live births.
Infant mortality rate (IMR) is defined as the ratio of infant deaths registered in a given year to the total number of live births in the same year. IMR is usually expressed as a rate per 1ooo live
births. Infants include those under the age of 1 year.
calculation:
• IMR = (Number of deaths of children under 1 year of age in a year x 1ooo)/(Number of live births in the same year).
• In the given question, out of total 456 births, 56 were dead born. Therefore, the number of live births= 456-56 = 4oo.
• In the same year, it is given that the number of deaths before 28 days is 56, and the number of    deaths after 28 days but before 1 year. Therefore, the total number of deaths of children under the age of 1 year is 56 + 34 = 9o
• IMR = (9ox1ooo)/4oo = 9oo/4 = 225
• Hence, the IMR is 225 per 1ooo live births.",,C,

b)A patient with sickle cell disease
c)A patient with cystic fibrosis
d)A patient with recurrent otitis media","The polysaccharide vaccine against streptococcus pneumoniae (ppsv-23) is most beneficial for patients with sickle cell disease.
s. pneumoniae is an encapsulated organism that is detected by the spleen and is removed.
However, in sickle cell disease, the sickled cells block the vessels in the spleen which results in splenic infarction. This hyposplenism results in an increased risk of pneumococcal infection.
Hence, pneumococcal vaccine (ppsv-23) is given to these patients as a prophylactic measure to



reduce this risk.",,B,
