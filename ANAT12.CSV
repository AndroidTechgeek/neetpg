Q1,A defect in which of the following forms the structure marked below?,"a) Internal oblique
b) External oblique
c) parietal peritoneum
d) Fascia transversalis","The structure marked is the deep inguinal ring, which is formed by a defect in fascia transversalis.
The deep inguinal ring is an opening in the transversalis fascia present 1 cm above the inguinal ligament, midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic symphysis. An indirect inguinal hernia arises through the deep inguinal ring lateral to the inferior epigastric vessel.",311-325.PNG,D,315-330.PNG
Q2,A student had his jaw locked while yawning. which of the following muscles is attached to the articular disc of the temporomandibular joint?,"a) Lateral pterygoid
b) Temporalis
c) Medial pterygoid
d) Masseter","The muscle that is attached to the articular disc of the temporomandibular joint is the lateral pterygoid.
Lateral pterygoid muscle:
• origin - upper head arises from the infratemporal surface and infratemporal crest of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. The lower head arises from the lateral surface of the lateral pterygoid plate.
• Insertion - It is inserted into the pterygoid fovea, the capsule of the temporomandibular joint, and the articular disc.
The action of lateral pterygoid muscle is depression, protrusion, and side-to-side movement of the jaw.",,A,
Q3,Identify the structure(s) in the following histological image.,"a) Leydig cells of testis
b) pancreatic islet cells
c) Hassall's corpuscles
d) Glomerulus","The above histology image shows the glomerulus.
Glomerulus is a rounded tuft of anastomosing capillaries lined by fenestrated endothelium. Blood enters the tuft through an afferent arteriole and leaves it through an efferent arteriole. It is supported by the mesangium containing mesangial cells and a non-cellular mesangial matrix.
The glomerular capillary wall is the filtering membrane and consists of fenestrated endothelial cells, basement membrane, and visceral epithelial cells called podocytes, which contain foot processes.",312-327.PNG,D,316-331.PNG
Q4,Injury at which of the following marked sites causes failure of dorsiflexion?,"a) 3
b) 2
c) 1
d) 4","The site marked as '3' in the x-ray given above is the neck of the fibula. Injury at this site causes failure of dorsiflexion (foot drop) due to injury to the common fibular nerve (also know as common peroneal nerve).
The common fibular nerve is derived from the dorsal branches of the 4th and 5th lumbar and 1st and 2nd sacral ventral rami. It runs obliquely along the lateral side of the popliteal fossa to the fibular head. It then curves laterally around the neck of the fibula and gets divided into superficial and deep fibular nerves.
superficial fibular nerve | Deep fibular nerve
--- | ---
Motor innervation: peroneus longus, peroneus brevis | Motor innervation: Extensor digitorum longus, Extensor hallucis longus, Tibialis anterior, peroneus tertius
sensory innervation: Lateral aspect of the lower leg, Dorsum of the toes except for the lateral side of the 5th toe and the first interdigital web-space | sensory innervation: The first interdigital space
Injury to the common peroneal nerve (common fibular nerve) at the level of the neck of the fibula causes foot drop. Ankle dorsiflexion, toe extension, and eversion of the foot are lost, while the inversion and plantar flexion are usually preserved.",312-326.PNG,A,319-336.PNG
Q5,A defect in which of the following aortic arches causes the defect shown in the image?,"a) 4th right
b) 4th left
c) 6th right
d) 6th left","The image above shows a patent ductus arteriosus due to a defect in the left side of the 6th aortic arch.
usually, in term infants, the ductus arteriosus closes within 72 hours of birth. Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close results in patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).
PDA usually presents with a hyperdynamic precordium, bounding peripheral pulses, wide pulse pressure, a machine-like continuous or systolic murmur, cardiomegaly, increased pulmonary vascular markings, hepatomegaly, increasing oxygen dependence, carbon dioxide retention, and renal failure.
other options
option A: The 4th right aortic arch gives rise to the proximal part of the right subclavian artery.
option B: The 4th left aortic arch gives rise to the arch of the aorta.
option C: The 6th right aortic arch forms the proximal part of the right pulmonary artery.",313-328.PNG,D,
Q6,which of the following structures develops from the structure marked A?,"a) Medial umbilical ligament
b) Median umbilical ligament
c) Meckel's diverticulum
d) Ligamentum teres","The structure marked A is the allantois. Its distal portion forms the urachus, which in turn gives rise to the median umbilical ligament.
The given image shows an embryo at the end of the third week.
Meckel's diverticulum is a congenital diverticulum arising from anti-mesenteric border of ileum. It is a remnant of the proximal part of the vitelline duct.",314-329.PNG,B,321-338.PNG
Q7,"A patient comes with abdominal pain, jaundice, and portal hypertension. Anastomosis between which of the following veins is seen?","a) Left colic vein and middle colic veins
b) Esophageal veins and left gastric veins
c) superior rectal and phrenic veins
d) sigmoid and superior rectal veins","In the given scenario of a patient with portal hypertension, anastomosis between esophageal veins and left gastric veins can be seen.
In portal hypertension, increased pressure within the portal venous system may result in the dilation of portal venous tributaries and reversed flow at sites of portosystemic anastomoses.
common sites of porto-systemic anastomoses and their clinical presentations are as follows:
portal | systemic | clinical presentation
--- | --- | ---
Left gastric vein | Distal esophageal veins | Esophageal and gastric varices
superior rectal vein | Middle and inferior rectal veins | Rectal varices
persistent tributaries of the left branch of the portal vein in ligamentum teres | periumbilical branches of epigastric and intercostal veins | caput medusae
Right branch of portal vein | Retroperitoneal veins draining into azygos, hemiazygos, lumbar, intercostal, and phrenic veins | Dilated retroperitoneal veins at risk during surgery or interventions
omental and colonic veins | Retroperitoneal veins near hepatic and splenic ■exures | At risk during surgery",,B,
Q8,A patient presents with swelling under the left ear lobule and complains of pain. which of the following structures is the likely cause of the pain?,"a) Facial nerve
b) Greater auricular nerve
c) Auriculotemporal nerve
d) Investing layer of deep cervical fascia","The cause of the pain in this patient complaining of pain in the parotid region is likely to be the greater auricular nerve.
The greater auricular nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin overlying the parotid gland and the ear lobule. pain associated with swelling and inflammation in the parotid region could be transmitted through the greater auricular nerve. The parotid gland is covered by a parotid capsule that is derived from the investing layer of deep cervical fascia. Any acute inflammation of the gland such as acute sialadenitis results in pain in the preauricular region. The pain is mainly due to stretching of the capsule resulting in stimulation of the greater auricular nerve.",nan,B,nan
