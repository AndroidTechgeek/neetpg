Q1,A 2-month-old infant is brought to the OPD with a parietal swelling present since birth. The X-ray image is given below. what could be the probable diagnosis?,"a)subgaleal hematoma
b)cephalhematoma
c)caput succedaneum
d)Enecephalocele","In the given clinical picture, the swelling over the infant's head is likely to be a cephalhematoma.
cephalohematoma is a collection of blood in between the pericranium and the flat bone
(subperiosteal) of the skull, usually unilateral and over a parietal bone. It is never present at birth but gradually develops after 12–24 h. The swelling is limited by the suture lines of the skull as the pericranium is fixed to the margins of the bone.



The arrow mark in the image represents cephalohematoma.
Note: cephalhematoma is more likely to be identified soon after birth, and its presence as a
defined area of swelling that does not cross suture lines is more consistent with this diagnosis.



subgaleal hematoma occurs between the galea aponeurotica and the periosteum. It is commonly    caused by birth trauma, particularly forceps or vacuum-assisted delivery. subgaleal hematoma can cross suture lines and typically presents as a soft, fluctuant swelling on the scalp.
caput succedaneum is an edema of the scalp that can cross suture lines. It is usually present at    birth or develops shortly after due to pressure on the presenting part of the head during labor. It generally resolves within a few days.
Encephalocele is a neural tube defect that results in a sac-like protrusion of the brain and its
meninges through an opening in the skull. It is a congenital condition and is typically diagnosed at birth or via prenatal ultrasound.",4012-2573.PNG,B,4015-2576.PNG;4015-2575.PNG
Q2,"A patient presented with abdominal pain and sterile pyuria, and the x-ray showed the following features. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)putty kidney
b)Nephrocalcinosis
c)staghorn calculus
d)psoas calcification","A patient with abdominal pain and sterile pyuria, with the given x-ray showing diffuse alveolar calcification in the right renal region point towards a diagnosis of a putty kidney.
The putty kidney is a characteristic finding of genitourinary tuberculosis (TB), specifically renal TB. The given image shows a homogenous and ground-glass-like calcification of the kidney
appearing like putty. It is caused by the dissemination of the organism through the bloodstream and is thus always a secondary TB. There is either reinfection or reactivation of old TB.
Genitourinary TB is a cause of sterile pyuria. Diagnosis is confirmed with a tuberculin test, or at least 3 consecutive early-morning specimens of urine are examined for acid-fast bacilli. They are stained with a ziehl-Neelsen stain and subsequently cultured.
CT is the most sensitive modality and is the preferred means of visualizing renal calcifications. CT urography is done to assess the various stages of renal TB and its manifestations, which are as
follows:
• Early:
• papillary necrosis
• progressive:
• Multifocal strictures
• Generalized or focal hydronephrosis
• Mural thickening and enhancement
• poorly enhancing renal parenchyma
• End-stage:
• progressive hydronephrosis
• Amorphous dystrophic calcification that involves the entire kidney - putty kidney
Treatment involves short-course therapy with antitubercular drugs like pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and rifampicin. partial nephrectomy, nephrectomy, or reconstructive surgery is often done.
option B: Nephrocalcinosis - This condition is characterized by the deposition of calcium in the    kidney parenchyma or tubules, often seen in hypercalcemic conditions like hyperparathyroidism. However, it would not explain the clinical presentation of sterile pyuria.





option C: staghorn calculi are large kidney stones that fill the renal pelvis and extend into the
renal calyces, often caused by urinary tract infections with organisms such as proteus,
pseudomonas, and staphylococcus. while these calculi can cause abdominal pain, they usually do not result in sterile pyuria, as they are associated with infection.
The image below shows a staghorn calculus of the left kidney.


option D: psoas calcification - This refers to calcification within the psoas muscle and is often   seen after acute renal failure and rhabdomyolysis. It is not associated with sterile pyuria and is not the cause of the patient's symptoms.",4013-2574.PNG,A,4017-2578.PNG;4017-2577.PNG
Q3,A woman with endometrial carcinoma is undergoing radiotherapy. which of the following is true?,"a)Intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source
b)small blood vessels are most radioresistant
c)Rapidly proliferating cells are most radioresistant
d)small intestinal mucosa is most radio-resistant","The true statement is that the intensity of radiation is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source in brachytherapy.
Radiotherapy is a common treatment modality for various cancers, including endometrial
carcinoma. It works by targeting rapidly dividing cancer cells with ionizing radiation, which can damage the DNA of these cells and lead to cell death. Radiotherapy can be delivered externally
(external beam radiotherapy) or internally (brachytherapy). In brachytherapy, radioactive sources are placed within or adjacent to the tumor, leading to a high radiation dose delivered directly to    the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue.
other options:
option B: Larger blood vessels are more radioresistant than microvasculature.
option C: permanent non-dividing cells are more radioresistant than rapidly proliferating cells. option D: small intestinal epithelial cells (intestinal crypts), which divide rapidly with no
differentiation are the most radiosensitive.",,A,
Q4,A patient presents with a history of fever and cough for the past 3-5 days. His examination findings reveal crepitations. chest X-ray is given below. what is the probable diagnosis?,"a)Apical segment of Right lower lobe consolidation
b)Right middle lobe consolidation
c)posterior segment of right lower lobe consolidation
d)Loculated pleural effusion","The given clinical scenario of fever, cough, and crepitations suggests features of
pneumonia. The chest X-ray showing opacities with obscuration of the right cardiac border is suggestive of right middle lobe consolidation.
This loss of clear demarcation between the normal lung and its surrounding soft structures (heart, diaphragm) is called the silhouette sign. It occurs due to loss of contrast between lungs and soft      tissue when the lung parenchyma is no longer filled with air. This sign may be seen in
consolidation, atelectasis, or mass lesions.
In the following images:
• Left image - red line indicates the normal demarcation between the right heart border and middle lobe of the right lung
• Right image - loss of demarcation i.e, positive silhouette sign due to right middle lobe consolidation





positive silhouette sign and corresponding anatomical site of pathology:
• Right heart border - right middle lobe or medial right lower lobe
• Left heart border - lingula segments of the left upper lobe
• Left hemidiaphragm or descending aorta - left lower lobe
• Aortic knuckle - left upper lobe (posterior segment)
• Right hemidiaphragm - right lower lobe
• Right paratracheal stripe - right upper lobe other options:
Apical segment of Right lower lobe consolidation: In this case, the chest X-ray would show an
opacity or consolidation in the apical segment of the right lower lobe. The consolidation would be located in the lower part of the right lung, towards the apex. The right heart border, however,
would remain visible, as it is not adjacent to the apical segment of the right lower lobe.
posterior segment of right lower lobe consolidation: A chest X-ray revealing consolidation in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe would show an opacity in the lower part of the right
lung, more posteriorly. This would not affect the visibility of the right heart border, as it is not   adjacent to the posterior segment of the right lower lobe. In a posteroanterior (pA) chest X-ray, this consolidation may be difficult to appreciate, but it would be more evident in a lateral view.
Loculated pleural effusion: In a chest X-ray showing a loculated pleural effusion, there would be a fluid collection within the pleural space. This fluid collection would appear as a well-defined
opacity, typically with a convex border facing the lung parenchyma. It may appear as a lenticular shape, conforming to the space between the lung and chest wall or diaphragm. The loculated
pleural effusion would not create a silhouette sign with the right heart border, as it is located in the pleural space rather than the lung parenchyma.",3997-2560-1.png,B,4019-2579.PNG
