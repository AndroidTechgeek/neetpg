Q1,"A child before playing consumed fruit from the garden. After some time he developed a high  fever, confusion, photophobia, and unable to urinate. what are the likely causative agent and the appropriate antidote used in this case?","a)Datura, pralidoxime
b)Datura, physostigmine
c)yellow oleander, pralidoxime
d)yellow oleander, physostigmine","The clinical vignette in the question is suggestive of Datura poisoning, for which the appropriate antidote is physostigmine, a reversible acetylcholine esterase antagonist. It is an effective
treatment for severe anticholinergic poisoning.
Datura poisoning:
The common names include thorn apple, Jimson weed, and Devil's trumpet. The active
ingredients include the anticholinergic alkaloids atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine. The seeds or other parts of the plant can be ingested or smoked.
Toxic manifestations of Datura:



• Mnemonic: ""hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone, red as a beet, and mad as a hatter""
• Also, remember the D's of Datura
• Dry hot skin (Temp rises up to 42 C, a scarlet rash may also be appreciated).
• Dilatation of pupils along with loss of accommodation
• Diplopia
• Dryness of the mouth and throat, unquenchable thirst
• Dysphagia
• Dilatation of cutaneous blood vessels
• Dysarthria (Difficulty in talking)
• Drunken gait
• Delirium
• Drowsiness
• Death due to respiratory or cardiac failure Treatment
• Gastric lavage or decontamination with activated charcoal or tannic acid: Gastric emptying is
often delayed, and the small, plentiful seeds can become trapped among the gastrointestinal folds after ingestion; thus, gastric decontamination can be an important therapy.
• physostigmine in severe toxicity given 1-2 mg IM/IV after every half hour as required: It is a physiological antidote. pilocarpine may also be given.
Medico-legal importance:
In India, Datura is used as a stupefying poison prior to robbery, kidnapping, and rape. It is also  known as a rail-road poison, as it is commonly encountered during a journey. Robbers disguised as saints may offer ‘prasad’ mixed with Datura seeds and rob the passengers.
yellow oleander:
All parts of the plant are poisonous. The active principles are thevatin and thevatoxin, which
are cardiac glycosides. The nectar of the flower yields poisonous honey. symptoms include a
burning sensation in the mouth, tingling of the tongue, dryness of the throat, vomiting, diarrhea,  headache, dilated pupils, irregular action of the heart followed by drowsiness, coma, collapse, and death.
Treatment includes
• Gastric lavage
• single-dose activated charcoal
• To combat acidosis IV sodium lactate and 5% glucose can be given
• Atropine, adrenaline, or noradrenaline (if blood pressure is low)
• Digoxin-specific antibodies

Q2,The method of autopsy carried out en masse to remove from tongue to prostate is_____.,"a)virchow technique
b)Rokitansky technique
c)Ghon technique
d)Letulle technique","The en masse removal of organs is done in the Letulle technique.
It is the removal of the cervical, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic organs as a single organ mass. They are subsequently dissected into organ blocks.",,D,
Q3,"A 42-year-old HIv-positive patient died, and his body was brought for post-mortem. The method of autopsy to be done is_____.","a)Ghon technique
b)Letulle technique
c)virchow technique
d)Rokitansky technique","Rokitansky's technique of autopsy will be done on patients with highly transmissible diseases such as HIV, Hepatitis B, etc.
It involves in situ dissection in part, combined with en block removal of organs.",,D,
Q4,"A 1o-year-old male child came to the casualty with difficulty in walking and pain in the
perianal region. on subjecting the specimen from the perianal region to a test, it produces



yellow needle-shaped rhombic crystals with picric acid. what is the test done?","a)Barberio test
b)Florence test
c)Teichmann test
d)Acid phosphatase test","The test done in the scenario is the Barberio test.
Barberio is used to detect seminal fluid. when a saturated aqueous or alcoholic solution of picric acid is added to the spermatic fluid, yellow needle-shaped rhombic crystals of spermine picrate    are produced.
other options:
option B: Florence test is used to detect semen. If semen is present, dark brown rhombic or needle-shaped crystals of choline iodide appear immediately
option C: The Teichmann test (hemin crystal test) is used to detect bloodstains. If bloodstain is present, faint yellowish-red to brownish-black rhombic crystals of hemin or hematin chloride



appear. when hydrogen peroxide is added, the hematin crystals give bubbles of gas.
option D: The acid phosphatase test is a quantitative test for the presence of acid phosphatase
enzyme in the semen. High levels of acid phosphatase from prostatic secretions are present in
seminal stains (Normal vaginal secretions have low levels of acid phosphatase). positive reactions are found till 36 hours after which the enzyme levels fall and disappear within 72 hours. In the
absence of demonstrable sperm or aspermia, this test can be considered conclusive.",,A,
Q5,"A patient was brought to casualty with seizures. He had multiple episodes and was taking herbal medicines for the same. He was conscious in between the episodes. During the
episodes, he had arching of his back. what is the likely cause?","a)Strychnine
b)Ricinus
c)Nerium odorum
d)Datura","The given clinical vignette suggests the diagnosis of strychnine poisoning.
strychnine poisoning occurs if a person ingests crushed seeds of strychnos nux vomica. If
swallowed uncrushed, the seeds of nux vomica have no poisonous action. The fatal dose is 15-3o mg of strychnine or one crushed seed.
strychnine is a competitive antagonist of glycine at the postganglionic receptors in the motor neurons of the anterior horn of the spinal cord. This leads to increased activity in the motor   neurons.
patients typically present with
• Convulsions are clonic initially but eventually become tonic.
• Risus sardonicus results from the contraction of the jaws and facial muscles in which the corners of the mouth are drawn back.
• The convulsions are most marked in anti-gravity muscles so that the body typically arches in hyperextension, the posture known as opisthotonus.
• If the spasm involves the abdominal muscles, the body bends forward (emprosthotonos), or to the side (pleurosthotonus).
• If death is preceded by a severe convulsion, as in strychnine poisoning, it causes an increase in the body temperature known as postmortem caloricity.
The first step in the management of strychnine poisoning is to control convulsions with
benzodiazepines or barbiturates to control seizures, and the patients should be placed in a dark room to avoid triggering further convulsions. Activated charcoal can be used to adsorb
unabsorbed poison after a thorough stomach wash. Acidification of urine can be done to increase the excretion of strychnine.
other options:
option B: Ricinus poisoning leads to symptoms such as the burning of the oral mucosa, salivation, nausea, vomiting, severe abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. It may also cause drowsiness,
convulsions, delirium, and death.
option C: Nerium poisoning presents with headache, dizziness, respiratory difficulty, and nausea. Ingestion causes difficulty in swallowing and articulation, abdominal pain, vomiting, profuse
frothy salivation, and diarrhea. Blood pressure falls, fibrillation, Av block, coma, respiratory paralysis, and death can occur due to cardiac failure.
option D: Datura poisoning presents with



• Dry hot skin (Temperature rises up to 42°c, a scarlet rash may also be appreciated)
• Dilatation of pupils along with loss of accommodation
• Diplopia
• Dryness of the mouth and throat, unquenchable thirst
• Dysphagia
• Dilatation of cutaneous blood vessels
• Dysarthria (Difficulty in talking)
• Drunken gait
• Delirium
• Drowsiness
• Death due to respiratory or cardiac failure",,A,

b)causing miscarriage without the consent of the mother
c)Death of the mother by act done with intent to cause miscarriage
d)causing the death of the quick unborn child by an act amounting to culpable homicide","BNS Section 9o (IPc 314) deals with the death of the mother due to miscarriage.
Important sections of IPc relating to miscarriages:
Note: A quick child is a fetus that has developed to such a stage that it moves within the womb of the mother. It shall mean an unborn child whose heart is beating, who is experiencing
electronically measurable brain waves, who is discernibly moving, and who is so far developed    and matured as to be capable of surviving the trauma of birth with the aid of usual medical care and facilities available in this state.

Q7,The temperature of a body of a deceased person is found to be 39 degrees celsius. which of the following is the most probable reason?,"a)cyanide poisoning
b)Septicemia
c)corrosive poisoning
d)Intra-abdominal hemorrhage","The condition in which the temperature of the body remains raised for about the first two hours after death is termed postmortem caloricity and the most probable reason for this is septicemia.
The condition occurs
• when the regulation of body temperature has been severely disturbed before death as in sunstroke or pontine hemorrhage.
• when heat production in muscles is increased due to convulsions as in tetanus and strychnine poisoning.
• when there is increased bacterial activity as in septicemia and cholera.",,B,
Q8,"A farmer was sleeping in the field, and he felt a sting on his leg. He saw something moving  away quickly. He then got drowsy and was taken to the hospital. He developed pain around the site and continued to bleed profusely from the wound site. The wound became red with blisters. which of the following is the most likely cause?","a)viper
b)cobra
c)wasp bite
d)scorpion","Based on the given clinical findings, the most likely cause is a bite of viper snake, resulting in a haemotoxic envenomation.
The Russell's viper has a flat and triangular head with a V-shaped mark, white in color, with the angle of the V pointing forwards. Along the back, it has three rows of diamond-shaped spots.
other points of identification include broad plates on its belly, the small scales on the head, and a shield beneath the tail divided into two rows. It is commonly found throughout India.
patients with Russell's viper bite usually present with severe pain, and redness around the bite
site. swelling usually develops followed by blisters in and around the wound site. persistent
bleeding from the bite site is a constant feature. patients may develop hemorrhagic syndrome due to bleeding from various sites like gums, nose, rectum, etc. In severe cases, shock may develop.
Bleeding and clotting time are usually prolonged. Death usually occurs due to shock or
hemorrhage.
other options:
option B: Cobra venom usually produces neurotoxic effects with minimal local effects.
Neurological manifestations of cobra venom include ptosis, paralysis of the face, palate, jaws, tongue, neck muscles, muscles of deglutition, and respiratory muscles.
option C: wasp stings cause immediate pain, a wheal and flare reaction, and local edema and    swelling that subside in a few hours. Multiple stings can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, generalized edema, dyspnea, hypotension, and collapse.
option D: scorpion sting usually presents with localized redness and burning pain which is unable to localize due to its radiation along the dermatomes involved, localized swelling, and punctate
hemorrhagic spots. other features include headache, profuse perspiration, chest discomfort,
paraesthesias, hypersalivation, cold extremities, and sometimes, priapism. Hypertension usually develops early, while pulmonary edema and myocarditis may develop later.",,A,
