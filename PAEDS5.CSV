Q1,"A fetus with intrauterine growth restriction was born prematurely with jaundice,
hepatosplenomegaly, microcephaly, and diffuse petechiae at birth. A brain CT was done
which revealed periventricular calcifications. what is the best method for the diagnosis of the etiological agent?","a)urine examination
b)Liver biopsy
c)Blood examinaton
d)CSF examination","periventricular calcifications and microcephaly in a baby with suspected congenital infection point toward cytomegalovirus (CMV). The best diagnostic method for CMV is pCR or viral culture on
urine.
since not all affected infants are viremic at birth, urine is a more reliable sample than blood.
Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), prematurity, and hepatosplenomegaly raise the suspicion of congenital infection. Hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, pneumonitis, petechiae, and
meningoencephalitis are common to toxoplasmosis, rubella, CMV, herpes simplex virus (HsV), enteroviruses and syphilis. Hydrocephalus is seen in CMV, toxoplasmosis, HsV, and rubella.
The characteristic clinical features of various congenital infections are described in the table below:
The triad of congenital CMV infection includes intracranial calcifications (periventricular), microcephaly, and chorioretinitis.
Most CMV transmission occurs in the first trimester. The risk of transmission is high in the third trimester. 9o% of the infected babies are asymptomatic and have lesser chances of having late
sequelae.
In symptomatic individuals, ganciclovir can limit hearing loss and improve the developmental outcome, while there is no definitive management for congenital CMV infection.

Q2,which of the following is false regarding the given image?,"a)It represents melanocytic hamartoma
b)It causes no visual disturbance
c)It is associated with facial angiofibroma
d)They are diagnostic of a neurocutaneous syndrome","The given image shows discrete tan-colored nodules over the iris called Lisch nodules (pigmented melanocytic hamartomas). They are seen in neurofibromatosis-1 (NF-1). Facial angiofibroma
(adenoma sebaceum) is a feature of tuberous sclerosis (TS) and not neurofibromatosis.
The image below shows facial angiofibroma seen in tuberous sclerosis (Bourneville disease).


Lisch nodules are specifically associated with NF-1 and are usually multiple and bilateral. They are best visualized with a slit lamp examination and don’t cause any visual disturbances.
other important ocular manifestations in NF-1 include eyelid plexiform neurofibroma, which
causes S-shaped deformity of the upper lid, with a 'bag of worms' like texture, optic nerve glioma, and spheno-orbital encephalocele due to dysplasia of greater wing of the sphenoid.



NF-1 (von Recklinghausen's disease) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a
loss-of-function mutation of the NF-1 gene located on chromosome 17q11.2. NF-1 produces
neurofibromin, which acts as a tumor suppressor and a negative regulator of RAs-MAP kinase signaling.
clinical features of NF-1 include café-au-lait macules, axillary freckling, Lisch nodules, neurofibromas, and optic gliomas.
NF-1 is more common than NF2 and typically diagnosed in childhood. NF-2 is rarer but often presents with bilateral acoustic neuroma, juvenile cataract and schwannoma.
The various neurocutaneous syndromes and their ocular manifestations are as follows:

Q3,congenital adrenal hyperplasia most commonly presents as _______.,"a)Male pseudohermaphroditism
b)Female pseudohermaphroditism
c)True hermaphroditism
d)46, Xy intersex","congenital adrenal hyperplasia (cAH) most commonly presents as female
pseudohermaphroditism as the most common enzyme deficiency is 21-hydroxylase deficiency. A female pseudohermaphrodite is a genotypically normal female (46, XX), whose external
genitalia resembles a male's.
The image below shows ambiguous genitalia in a female with cAH:





The mechanism underlying the endocrine defects in 21-hydroxylase deficiency is depicted in the image below:


Babies with 21-hydroxylase deficiency typically present around 1o-14 days of age with the subset of symptoms due to aldosterone deficiency, cortisol deficiency and androgen excess.
Aldosterone deficiency leads to salt-wasting crises marked by hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis.
cortisol deficiency causes manifestations like hypoglycemia, hyperpigmentation, weight loss, weakness, anorexia, vomiting, and shock.
Androgen excess in 21-hydroxylase deficiency results in virilization of females, leading to female     pseudohermaphroditism, and precocious puberty in males. virilization is usually apparent at birth in females and within 2 to 3 years of life in males.
without treatment, shock, cardiac arrhythmias, and death may occur within days or weeks.



other options:
option A: Male pseudohermaphroditism is seen in CAH due to 17α-hydroxylase deficiency     resulting in incomplete virilization. 17α-hydroxylase deficiency is 2nd most common enzyme affected in CAH.
option C: True hermaphroditism is presently referred to as an ovotesticular disorder of sex   development(DSD). Here, both ovarian and testicular tissue is present. It is not due to CAH.
option D: 46 Xy intersex (now called 46 Xy DSD) has under virilization of genitalia. Adrenal causes include lipoid adrenal hyperplasia, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency,
17-hydroxylase/17,2o-lyase deficiency, and not 21 hydroxylase deficiency.",,B,5575-3555.PNG;5575-3554.PNG
Q4,A newborn presented with a tuft of hair over the lumbosacral region. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)spina bifida occulta
b)spinal lipoma
c)Dermal sinus
d)Any of the above","A tuft of hair over the lumbosacral region in a newborn is suggestive of occult spinal dysraphism    or neural tube defect. It comprises a range of conditions, including spina bifida occulta, intradural lipoma, and dorsal dermal sinus.
Spinal dysraphism is due to the defective fusion of the midline embryonic neural, vertebral, and mesenchymal structures. Associated clinical features are high-arched feet, muscle size and
strength differences between legs, and abnormal walking patterns. In newborns and young
infants, the neurological examination is usually normal, but older children may experience a lack of sensation in the perineal area and back pain.
Most of the patients will have a cutaneous abnormality overlying the lower spine, including a small dimple, a tuft of hair, or a subcutaneous lipoma.
The image shows a tuft of hair in a case of spinal dysraphism:


Spinal dysraphism also includes meningocele, myelomeningocele, lipomeningocele,
diastematomyelia (split spinal cord), thickened filum terminale, and cauda equina tumour.
The initial investigation is usually ultrasound in the neonate and the best investigation is MRI.



Spina bifida is the most common type of spinal dysraphism, in which the spinal column does not close completely, leaving the spinal cord and its protective covering exposed.


Myelomeningocele is the most severe form of spina bifida, where the spinal cord and nerve roots  are exposed and may be damaged. A sac-like protrusion, containing spinal cord tissue, meninges, and cerebrospinal fluid, is visible outside the body, often leading to significant neurological
impairments and disabilities.",,D,5576-3556.PNG;5577-3557.PNG
Q5,what is the most common cause of ventriculomegaly in newborns?,"a)Arnold-chiari malformation
b)Dandy-walker syndrome
c)Arachnoid villi malformation
d)Aqueductal stenosis","Aqueductal stenosis is the most common cause of ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus in newborns.
ventriculomegaly is the dilation of the ventricles. when ventriculomegaly occurs in association with raised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, it is called hydrocephalus.
pathologic etiologies can be congenital or acquired. Congenital causes include structural
abnormalities such as aqueductal stenosis, agenesis of the corpus callosum, Dandy-walker
malformations, Chiari malformations, and neural tube defects. Acquired causes are intracranial  infections(cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis), intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic injury, and brain parenchymal tumors.
Aqueductal stenosis is the narrowing or obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct, a narrow channel
that connects the third and fourth ventricles in the brain. As a result, the fluid accumulates within the ventricles, causing them to enlarge.
Treatment for aqueductal stenosis includes ventriculostomy, diuretics, serial lumbar punctures in specific cases, and CSF diversion. In severe cases, CSF diversion procedures (shunting), may be     necessary to redirect the flow of CSF and relieve pressure on the brain.",,D,5578-3559.PNG
Q6,when do you consider administering epinephrine in a neonate during resuscitation?,"a)Heart rate remains at &lt; 6o beats/minute despite effective compressions and ventilations.
b)Heart rate remains at &lt; 1oo beats/minute despite effective compressions and ventilations.
c)Heart rate does not improve after 3o seconds with bag and mask ventilation.
d)Infants with severe respiratory depression fail to respond to positive-pressure ventilation via bag and mask.","As per the newborn resuscitation protocol (NRP), a heart rate &lt; 6o beats/minute despite effective compressions and ventilation is the indication to administer epinephrine.
The NRP algorithm is shown below:


The response to neonatal resuscitation at various steps is assessed based on the heart rate, as a rise in heart rate is the most effective indicator of successful ventilatory effort.
If the heart rate is less than 1oo, positive pressure ventilation (PPv) is provided with a bag and mask.
In case of no response even after doing ventilation corrective steps (options C and D), endotracheal intubation is done.



The ventilation corrective steps are as follows and can be remembered with the mnemonic MRSOPA.
• Mask has to be reapplied
• Reposition head
• Suction the secretions
• Open mouth slightly and ventilate
• Pressure is increased slightly
• Airway may be changed
If the heart rate is below 6o, then chest compressions are initiated over the lower third of the sternum at a rate of 9o compressions/min. The ratio of compressions to ventilation is 3:1.
If the heart rate continues to remain &lt;6o despite effective compressions and ventilation, then
IV epinephrine is given.",,A,5578-3558.PNG
Q7,which of the following is not true regarding ataxia-telangiectasia?,"a)Mutations in 11q gene is implicated
b)Follows autosomal dominant mode of inheritance
c)Humoral and cellular immunodeficiency
d)Linked to adenocarcinomas","Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) or Louis–Bar syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder.
The defect in AT is in the ATM gene localized to chromosome 11q22-23. The ATM gene is involved in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks. This defect in DNA repair leads to combined
immunodeficiency (impaired immunoglobin isotype switching and association with thymic
hypoplasia) and predisposition to an increased risk of lymphoreticular tumors such as lymphoma or leukemia.
AT is characterized by progressive ataxia (beginning during infancy), telangiectasia (initially on bulbar conjunctiva), sinopulmonary infections, hypogonadism, sensitivity to ionizing radiation, insulin resistance, and raised alpha-fetoprotein levels.",,B,
Q8,warthin Finkeldey cells are seen in:,"a)Rubella
b)Rubeola
c)Rabies
d)Typhoid","warthin-Finkeldey cells are multinucleated giant cells that are present in the prodromal stage of measles (rubeola), HIV lymphadenitis, and various benign and malignant lymphoid conditions.
The cytopathic effect of measles consists of multinucleate syncytium formation with numerous acidophilic nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions.
The image given below shows the warthin-Finkeldey giant cells:





Measles is an infection caused by paramyxovirus which is a single-stranded enveloped RNA virus. It spreads 4 days before and 5 days after the appearance of the rash through body secretions.
clinical features include mild fever, conjunctivitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and
pathognomic koplik spots. The koplik spots are red lesions with bluish-white spots seen in the inner cheeks at the level of premolars. The red maculopapular rashes begin on the forehead,
behind the ears, and on the upper neck on the 4th day. It then spreads towards the torso, and extremities and reaches the palms and soles.
The diagnosis is mainly made clinically but a serological demonstration of IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies is also used. complications include pneumonia, croup, and tracheitis. subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis is a fatal complication of chronic measles diagnosed by elevated IgG levels in cerebrospinal fluid.",,B,5580-3560.PNG
Q9,which of the following is an X-linked disorder?,"a)color blindness
b)Thalassemia
c)sickle cell anemia
d)cystic fibrosis","color blindness is primarily inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. The genes for color vision are located on the X chromosome.
Males have a single X chromosome inherited from mothers. If the X chromosome inherited  carries a mutation, males exhibit the disease. However, females become carriers of the color blindness gene and have a 5o% chance of passing it on to their children.
Female carriers usually are protected because of the random inactivation of one X chromosome. But there is a possibility that the mutant X chromosome remains active if the normal alleles are  inactivated in some of the cells so the heterozygous female can express the disorder partially.
The image shows the pattern of X-linked inheritance:





In color blindness, the mechanism to appreciate one or more primary colors is either defective
(anomalous) or absent (anopia). It may be congenital or acquired. congenital color blindness can be dyschromatopsia (defective color vision of any one of the RGB colors) or achromatopsia
(complete color blindness of all three RGB colors). RGB colors are red, green, and blue. Tests for color blindness include the Ishihara test, Hardy–Rand–Rittler test, and
Farnsworth–Munsell 1oo-hue test.",,A,5581-3561.PNG
Q10,The following parameter in ALL indicate a poor prognosis ________.,"a)Age &gt;1o years
b)Leukocyte count &lt;5o,ooo/mm3
c)Hyperdiploidy
d)Trisomy of chromosomes 4, 1o, and 17","Age &gt;1o years indicates a poor prognosis in ALL.
Leukocyte count &lt;5o,ooo/mm3, hyperdiploidy, and trisomy of chromosomes 4,1o,17 indicate a good prognosis.",,A,
Q11,Viral infection causing transient aplastic anemia is ______,"a)HIV
b)polio
c)parvovirus B-19
d)HHV-8","parvovirus B19
• common, most prevalent are the rash illness of erythema infectiosum and transient aplastic crisis.
• Transmission by respiratory route but also transmissible in blood and blood products.
• shows erythrotropism – it specifically targets the erythroid cell line, especially the
pronormoblast stage. viral infection produces cell lysis, leading to depletion of erythroid precursors and a transient arrest of erythropoiesis. This may lead to a precipitous fall in  haemoglobin which may even require blood transfusion.
clinical manifestations of parvovirus B19 infection
• Erythema infectiosum/Fifth disease (slapped cheek appearance)



• Transient aplastic anemia
• petechial/ purpuric skin eruptions: papular purpuric “gloves and socks” syndrome
• Arthritis and arthralgia
• chronic anemia in immunocompromised persons
• primary maternal infection is associated with non-immune fetal hydrops and intrauterine fetal demise.",,C,
Q12,what is true about ovotesticular disorders of sex development?,"a)karyotype is 46 Xy.
b)ovotestis is seen in the gonadal biopsy
c)The response of testosterone to hcG is increased.
d)uterus is usually absent.","ovotesticular disorder of sex development (DSD) is characterized by the presence of both ovarian and testicular tissue in the same individual. An ovotestis is present in approximately 2/3 of
affected individuals.
Most affected individuals have a 46, XX chromosomal karyotype, which normally results in female sexual development. In about 1o% of patients, testicular tissue in an individual with a 46, XX
karyotype is present as a result of a translocation of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome to the X chromosome or another chromosome. There is a defect in R-spondin1 protein encoded by the
RSpo1 gene, described in 46, XX ovotesticular DSD.
An abnormal vagina and an underdeveloped uterus are usually present. The testes are usually
undescended, and the penis may present with hypospadias. upon reaching puberty, breast
development, feminization, and menstruation may occur. Most affected individuals are infertile, but ovulation or spermatogenesis is possible. The response of testosterone to hcG is normal or   reduced.",,B,
Q13,which one of the following is not included in the criteria for neurofibromatosis 1?,"a)Two or more iris hamartomas
b)Acoustic neuromas
c)Dysplasia of the sphenoidal and tibial bone
d)cafe-au-lait spots","In neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), two or more of the following clinical manifestations are present:
• Six or more café-au-lait macules
• Axillary or inguinal freckling
• Two or more iris Lisch nodules (hamartomas of iris)
