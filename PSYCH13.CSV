"Q1","A boy is experiencing low mood, decreased energy, and decreased interest in his
surroundings. He is not taking food for the past one week. The thought sample says ""I lost my head. I am dead. How can I eat?"". what is the delusion seen in this case?","a)cotard's syndrome
b)Hypochondriacal delusion
c)Nihilistic delusion
d)Bizarre delusion","The type of delusion seen in this patient is a nihilistic delusion.
Nihilism refers to the delusion of the non-existence of self or parts of self. It also includes an attitude of rejection of established values or extreme skepticism regarding moral and value
judgments. The patient may believe that they are going to die soon or their organs are rotting.
Delusion of nihilism is often seen as a mood-congruent delusion in depression with psychotic
symptoms. This patient has three major symptoms of depression — low energy, depressed mood,  and lack of interest in the surroundings. However, these symptoms have to be present for a period of at least 14 days to make the diagnosis of major depressive disorder.
other options:
option A: cotard's syndrome was first described by Jules cotard. He described a psychotic
disorder characterized by severe depression and nihilistic delusions regarding one's own body or existence. In the DSM or IcD, cotard's syndrome is not classified separately. Nihilistic delusions have been mentioned as examples of mood-congruent delusions in a depressive episode with
psychotic features.
option B: patients with hypochondriacal delusions are fixated on one or more somatic symptoms as evidence of some severe, yet undetected disease. They undergo repeated and unnecessary
medical examinations and tests. There are frequent deteriorations of relationships with their doctors when nothing suggesting a disease is ever found, and this leads to doctor shopping.
option D: Delusions are false and fixed ideas that are not shared by other people. Bizarre
delusions are the ones whose content is out of the realm of possibility, for example, a patient believing that aliens abduct him and take him to Mars every night. Typically, patients with     schizophrenia tend to have bizarre delusions.","","C",""
"Q2","La belle indifference is seen in:","a)Mania
b)Depression
c)schizophrenia
d)conversion disorder","La belle indifference is seen in conversion disorder.
La belle indifference refers to a lack of concern towards the symptoms, despite the apparent
severity of the disability. Although not pathognomonic of conversion disorder, it is often seen in



association with it.
conversion disorder is also known as functional neurological symptom disorder or dissociative disorder. It includes acute and temporary loss of motor or sensory function without any
underlying neurological disease. Because the onset of such symptoms often coincides with
psychological issues such as internal conflict, it was speculated that these issues converted to neurological symptoms. conversion disorder can present with symptoms such as paresis,
non-epileptic seizures (NES), blindness, and anesthesia of the extremities. one of the gait
disturbances which can be seen is astasia-abasia — a wildly ataxic, staggering gait with gross and irregular truncal movements, and thrashing and waving arm movements. The patient often has a carefree attitude towards his illness as mentioned above.
patients of conversion disorder achieve primary gain by keeping internal conflicts outside of their awareness. These conflicts manifest as physical symptoms. As a result of being sick, the patients   are excused from obligations and receive support that might not otherwise have been available.    This is referred to as secondary gain.","","D",""
"Q3","scOFF protocol is used for assessing:","a)Mental health disorder
b)Behavioural disorder
c)sexual health disorder
d)Eating disorder","The ScoFF (Sick, control, one, Fat, Food) questionnaire is a screening tool for eating disorders (anorexia nervosa and bullimia nervosa).
It consists of 5 questions addressing the core features of these disorders. The ScoFF questions are:
• Do you make yourself Sick because you feel uncomfortably full?
• Do you worry that you have lost control over how much you eat?
• Have you recently lost more than one stone (~6.35 kg) in a 3-month period?
• Do you believe yourself to be Fat when others say you are too thin?
• would you say that Food dominates your life?
A 'yes' answer to 2 or more questions out of the 5 indicates likely anorexia or bulimia.","","D",""
"Q4","The tactile hallucinations seen in cases of chronic cocaine intoxication is?","a)Oneroid state
b)Formication
c)Dipsomania
d)carphologia","Formication, which refers to the sensation of insects crawling beneath the skin, is a feature of cocaine abuse. It is also referred to as Magnan's symptoms or cocaine bugs.
The symptoms of acute stimulant intoxication include agitation, irritability, aggression, and an
increase in psychomotor activity. on examination, tachycardia, hypertension, and mydriasis may be seen. when psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations are present due to
stimulants such as cocaine, it is referred to as stimulant-induced psychotic disorder. paranoid
delusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of stimulant-induced psychosis. Tactile hallucinations in the form of formication are seen in cocaine use. The presence of these symptoms depends on    the dose and duration of the substance abuse and thus may not be seen in all patients.
cocaine-induced psychotic disorders are more frequently seen in intravenous users and those who



use crack (an extremely potent and addictive form of cocaine that can be smoked).
other options:
option A: oneroid state is a dream-like state which can happen because of substance use or some organic disorder.
option C: Dipsomania refers to a compulsive urge to drink alcoholic beverages. patients suffering from alcohol-use disorders feel a need for daily use of large amounts of alcohol for adequate
functioning throughout the day.
option D: Carphologia (also known as floccillation) refers to the action of trying to pick imaginary objects. The patient will usually be trying to pick lint from his clothes or the bedsheet. This is
often seen in delirium. Datura intake can lead to a delirious state and may show carphologia.","","B",""
"Q5","which of the following is used to define dependence?","a)1, 2
b)1 only
c)1, 2, 3, 4
d)1, 2, 3","According to ICD-11, dependence on any substance is characterized by:
• strong internal drive to use the substance, which the patient is unable to control.
• Increased priority is given to the use of the substance over other activities.
• persistence of substance use despite harmful consequences.
• presence of the subjective sensation of urge or craving to use the substance.
• Tolerance to the effect of the substance; the patient may require higher amounts of the substance to achieve the same effect.
• Appearance of withdrawal symptoms on cessation or reduction in the dose of the substance.
The diagnosis of dependence can be made if these symptoms are present for at least a period of 3 months.","","C",""
"Q6","A pregnant female with bipolar disorder came to the clinic in the third trimester. She has had 4 episodes in the past and is stable on lithium 75o mg/day since 1 year during which time she has not had any episodes. what is the next best step in management?","a)Stop lithium and let her be drug free
b)Increase lithium dosage
c)Decrease lithium dosage
d)Switch to valproate","In this scenario of a pregnant woman in her third trimester with bipolar disorder with multiple past episodes and currently stable on lithium, the best next step in management is to decrease  lithium dosage within therapeutic levels.
Lithium is a mood stabilizer with a very narrow therapeutic index and is the first line of
management in bipolar disorder. Lithium therapy should be continued throughout the pregnancy in women who have severe, frequent episodes, and these patients should be counseled about the   reproductive risks associated with therapy. Ideally, the next best step in this scenario would be to monitor lithium blood levels monthly until 34 weeks, and weekly monitoring thereafter until
delivery. However, dose reduction can be considered closer to delivery as there may be an
increased risk of lithium toxicity in the fetus. According to NICE guidelines, it is recommended to stop lithium during active labour, measure lithium levels 12 hours after the last dose and
reestablish prophylactic levels after delivery.



First and second trimester are characterised by a significant decrease of lithium blood levels with a risk of subtherapeutic levels. In third trimester and the postpartum, lithium levels gradually
return to their preconception level which implicates that in this period clinicians need to be aware of the risk of lithium intoxication (option B).
Bipolar disorder has been associated with adverse perinatal outcomes such as preterm birth.
Medication discontinuation in pregnancy (option A) can pose an increased risk for relapse.
Moreover, symptomatic women during pregnancy more likely have postpartum relapses that can be severe.
Typical therapy for bipolar disorder includes mood stabilizers such as lithium, valproic acid, and carbamazepine and antipsychotic medications. Bipolar disorder during pregnancy is a
complicated condition that is best treated in tandem with psychiatric care. Risks and advantages of mood stabilizers, some of which are teratogenic, must be considered while making decisions.
For example, lithium use during the first trimester has been linked to Ebstein anomaly, although very rarely. Fetal echocardiography is recommended for lithium-exposed fetuses. Fetal lithium
exposure is also associated with neonatal goiter, CNS depression, hypotonia (floppy baby syndrome), and cardiac murmur.
Maternal adverse effects of lithium can be acute such as tremors, ataxia, weakness, polyuria, polydipsia or chronic such as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, thyroid dysfunction, and
hyperparathyroidism.
Due to all these adverse effects, patients on lithium therapy should have routine monitoring of   serum electrolytes, serum calcium, thyroid profile, renal function tests, ECG, and serum lithium levels.
other options :
option D : It is not necessary to switch to valproate in the third trimester as the patient is already stable on lithium. use of valproate in the first trimester is associated with significant
teratogenicity.","","C",""
"Q7","HEADSSS assessment will be used by an intern for which of the following patient groups?","a)children under 5 years
b)Neonates
c)Infants
d)Adolescents","HEADSSS assessment is done in adolescents to determine early symptoms of mental disorders and functional impairment in major life domains such as home and family, school, peers, and   community.
These domains are included in the HEADSSS (Home, Education, Activities, Drugs, Sexuality, Suicide/Depression, Safety) Interview Guide. An adolescent’s risk and protective factors are    identified during each visit using this assessment. Risk factors increase the likelihood that an adolescent will engage in risky behaviors, whereas protective factors build an adolescent’s
resiliency and ability to cope with stress.
Examples of questions in HEADSSS assessment :
