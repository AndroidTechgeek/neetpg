Q1,A patient met with road traffic accident and complained of severe back ache. The X-ray is shown below. what fracture does the patient have?,"a)chance fracture
b)Burst fracture
c)compression fracture
d)Fracture of spinous process","The X-ray shows a vertebral fracture with a horizontal fracture line passing through the body of the vertebra. This indicates chance fracture.
chance fracture is also known as seat-belt injury or the jack-knife injury. This injury is typically
located in the upper lumbar spine in people involved in motor vehicle collisions while wearing a lap seat belt without a shoulder harness. The sudden deceleration causes flexion and posterior
distraction of the spine. This causes the mid-lumbar spine to bend like a jack-knife around an axis anterior to the vertebral column.



There is a tear in the vertebra that passes transversely through the bones (bony chance fracture), or the ligamentous structures (soft chance fracture), or both. There is little or no crushing of the  vertebral body. However, it is an unstable injury as the posterior and middle columns are
distracted. Neurological damage is uncommon. Associated intra-abdominal injuries are seen in 5o% of these injuries.


X-rays may show a horizontal fracture with the split running through the vertebra. It may involve the spinous process, the transverse processes, pedicles and the vertebral body. There may be
opening up of the disc space posteriorly.
Most chance fractures can be managed conservatively with bed rest and bracing. If posterior
fixation is done, it will allow early mobilization. Ligamentous chance fractures require posterior instrumented fusion.
other options:
option B: Burst fracture results from severe axial compression that explodes the vertebral body. The lateral view cT image showing the L4 vertebra burst fracture is given below.






option C: spinal compression fractures occur as a result of injury, common fall onto the buttock  or pressure from normal activities, to the weakened vertebrae due to osteoporosis. Compression   causes a short oblique fracture. The image showing the L4 vertebra compression fracture is given below:


option D: Fracture of the spinous process of C7(Clay shoveller's Fracture) is an example of an     avulsion injury which may occur with severe voluntary contraction of the muscles at the back of the neck.",5469-3486.PNG,A,5479-3497.PNG;5479-3496.PNG;5480-3498.PNG
Q2,An 18-year-old boy complains of fever and pain in the lower limb. There is a localised rise of   temperature and tenderness in the region shown in the radiograph. ESR is raised. what is the most probable diagnosis?,"a)osteosarcoma
b)Ewing's sarcoma
c)Giant cell tumour
d)osteomyelitis","The clinical features and radiograph showing onion peel type of periosteal reaction point towards a diagnosis of Ewing’s sarcoma.
Ewing's sarcoma is a malignant tumour that occurs more frequently in males, typically between 1o and 2o years of age and has a diaphyseal long-bone location. The femur is the most common
long-bone site, followed by the tibia, humerus and fibula. Ewing’s sarcoma is believed to arise from mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow.
pain is the earliest symptom, followed by swelling and a low-grade fever. Radiographically, an aggressive, permeative, poorly defined osteolytic lesion with cortical destruction, periosteal
reaction and large, radiolucent soft-tissue mass may be found. periosteal reaction is common in young patients with the lamellar ‘onion-skin’ appearance causing fusiform bone enlargement.
Ewing’s sarcoma is composed of primitive, undifferentiated, small, round blue cells with large nuclei and scant cytoplasm. The characteristic translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22  results in a fusion gene, EWsR1-FL11, which is present in 9o% of cases.
preoperative chemotherapy frequently results in extensive tumour necrosis and shrinkage. Agents used in Ewing’s sarcoma include vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide. Wide excision may be combined with adjuvant radiotherapy if surgical margins are poor. A more favourable
outcome is expected with younger age, distal appendicular sites, small tumour volume, normal



ESR and greater chemotherapy necrosis response.


other options:
option A: osteosarcoma has a periosteal reaction characterised as the Codman triangle. It can also be seen in Ewing’s sarcoma.


option C: Giant cell tumor has a characteristic soap bubble appearance.





option D: Acute osteomyelitis in children presents with fever, pain, refusal to bear weight,
elevated WBC count, elevated CRP, and elevated ESR. During the first week, the X-ray appears to be normal and by the second week, a faint extracortical line may be visible due to periosteal new   bone formation. This is a classic sign of early pyogenic osteomyelitis. A combination of regional     osteoporosis with a localized segment of apparently increased density is an important late finding in this condition.
Chronic osteomyelitis presents with erythema, chronic pain, swelling, tenderness, and discharging sinus tract. X-ray shows sequestrum is a piece of devitalized bone that has been separated from its surrounding bone during the process of necrosis, involucrum is the thick sheath of periosteal new  bone that surrounds the sequestrum and cloacae are openings in the involucrum that allow
drainage of purulent and necrotic material out of the dead bone.",5470-3488.PNG,B,5481-3499-1.png;5481-3499.PNG;5430-3469.PNG;5482-3500.PNG
Q3,A child sustained an injury as shown in the below radiograph. what is the classification used and the grade used for this type of injury?,"a)salter harris classification-type III
b)Gartland's classification-type IV
c)Gartland's classification-type III
d)salter harris classification-type IV","The given clinical features and X-ray image are suggestive of a supracondylar fracture of the humerus (extension type) and Gartland classification is used in this case. The extension type fracture which is displaced with no intact posterior cortex is type 3 as per this classification.
Gartland classification (in children):
• Type I: undisplaced
• Type II: Displaced but posterior cortex is intact
• Type III: Displaced but no intact posterior cortex and distal fragment could be either displaced:
• posteromedial
• posterolateral
supracondylar fracture of the humerus is most commonly seen in children of 5-7 years after a fall on an outstretched hand with the elbow in full extension. It is most commonly of extension type
followed by flexion type. Gartland classification is used for supracondylar fractures. The
three-point bony relationship is maintained in supracondylar fracture (option B). Three-point  bony landmarks in the elbow are the tips of medial and lateral epicondyles and the olecranon.
Nerve and vessel injury:
• The most common nerve to be injured in extension type - anterior interosseous nerve &gt; Median nerve &gt; Radial nerve &gt; ulnar nerve. (AMRu)
• The most common nerve to be injured in the flexion type the ulnar nerve.
• The most common vessel to be injured - the brachial artery.
Radiological findings: An undisplaced fracture may show a triangular lucency like a sail of a yacht (sail sign), also called a fat pad sign. This is due to the fat pad around the elbow being pushed
forward by the hematoma. Baumann’s angle (humeral-capitellar angle) can help in assessing the degree of medial angulation before and after reduction.
The most common complication of supracondylar fracture is malunion. This leads to cubitus
varus or gunstock deformity. Malunion occurs due to improper reduction and not due to physeal damage, as the fracture is extraphyseal other complications include myositis ossificans,
compartment syndrome, and volkmann ischemic contracture.
undisplaced supracondylar humerus fractures are treated by an above-elbow plaster slab with the elbow in 9oº flexion. Displaced fractures are treated by closed reduction and K-wire fixation since  they tend to slip after reduction. open fractures or those associated with brachial artery injury are treated by open reduction and internal fixation.
other options:
options A and D: salter and Harris created a classification of physeal injuries for risk stratification.
• Type 3: Here, the fracture splits the epiphysis and then goes transversely in either direction into the hypertrophic layer of the physis. This leads to damage of the growth plate leading to growth    disturbance.
• Type 4: The fracture splits the epiphysis and extends into the metaphysis. Displacement can occur in these types leading to asymmetrical growth.",5470-3487.PNG,C,
Q4,A patient sustained a fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal in the right foot. He was advised below knee pop cast. How long should the cast be put?,"a)6-8 weeks
b)2-3 weeks
c)3-5 weeks
d)16-2o weeks","The given X-ray indicates a Jones fracture. conservative management involves a short-leg non-weight bearing cast for 6-8 weeks.
A Jones fracture is typically caused by forced inversion of the foot, such as during a pothole
injury, leading to the avulsion of the base of the fifth metatarsal. This injury is due to the pull of     the peroneus brevis tendon or the lateral band of the plantar fascia, which inserts onto the base of the fifth metatarsal.
surgical correction, such as intramedullary screw fixation, is recommended for faster healing in   highly active individuals. proximal avulsion fractures can generally be managed symptomatically with rest and support, followed by early mobilization and return to function.",5471-3489.PNG,A,5482-3500-1.png
Q5,"Following a road traffic accident, a patient with an intertrochanteric fracture of the femur was treated with the implant shown below. Identify the implant.","a)proximal femoral nail
b)Dynamic hip screw
c)Austin Moore prosthesis
d)Herbert screw","The above radiograph shows an extramedullary implant called a dynamic hip screw.
Intertrochanteric fractures of the femur can be treated by:
• Extramedullary implants - dynamic hip screw
• Intramedullary implants - proximal femoral nail and gamma nail.
Dynamic hip screws are used in undisplaced intertrochanteric fractures, whereas proximal femoral nails are used in displaced intertrochanteric fractures.
The below image shows a dynamic hip screw.






Advantages of using a proximal femoral nail over a dynamic hip screw include:
• smaller incisions
• Reduced blood loss
• Decreased femoral neck shortening
• Decreased risk of infection other options:
option A: The below image shows a proximal femoral nail with locking and stabilization screws.






option C: Austin Moore's implant is an older implant used in unipolar hemiarthroplasty. It can be identified by the fenestrations on the shaft of the prosthesis, as shown below.





option D: Herbert screw is cannulated and threaded at both ends. It is designed for use in fractures of small articular bones such as carpals and scaphoid.",5464-3483.PNG,B,5464-3483.PNG;5464-3482.PNG;5486-3502.PNG;5486-3501.PNG;5487-3504.PNG;5487-3503.PNG;5488-3506.PNG
Q6,"A young woman, following an intense workout involving heavy weight lifting, presents with    lower back pain radiating to her right hip and extending down to her right ankle. MRI shows the following finding. Based on the location and radiation of her pain, which of the following nerve roots is most likely involved?","a)L4
b)L5
c)S1
d)L3","Based on the clinical presentation of lower back pain radiating to the right hip and ankle, along   with an MRI showing L4-L5 disc prolapse, the likely nerve root involved is L5. In a typical L4-L5 disc herniation, the L5 nerve root is most commonly compressed.
other options:
option A: L4: Involvement typically causes symptoms around the knee and anterior lower leg, but not the ankle.
option C: S1: Compression here causes symptoms in the posterior leg, calf, and heel, differing from this case's distribution of pain.
option D: L3: Affects the anterior thigh, with no radiating pain below the knee.",5472-3490.PNG,B,5488-3505.PNG;5489-3507.PNG
Q7,"A child with rickets not responding to treatment is being evaluated. Investigations show a serum calcium level of 9 mg/dL, low phosphate level of 2 mg/dL, elevated alkaline
phosphatase, and normal parathyroid hormone levels with normal arterial blood gas levels. what is the diagnosis?","a)vitamin D resistant rickets type 2
b)Hypophosphatemic rickets
c)vitamin D resistant rickets type 1
d)Nutritional rickets","The given scenario indicates the diagnosis of hypophosphatemic rickets because of the following features:
• normal calcium levels (Normal: 9-11 mg/dL)
• normal parathyroid hormone levels
• decreased phosphate (Normal: 2.5-4.3 mg/dL)
• elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase (Normal: 33-96 U/L)
• normal arterial blood gas levels
Hypophosphatemic rickets:
X-linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets are the most common genetic cause of rickets while the most common, overall is nutritional vitamin D
deficiency. PHEX gene (phosphate-regulating endopeptidase on x chromosome) products are
responsible for the inactivation of phosphatonin. Mutation of this PHEX leads to increased
phosphatonin (FGF 23) levels, and hence, the excretion of phosphorous is increased. This is also
associated with impaired renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate leading to its excess excretion. The chart attached below summarizes the evaluation of hypophosphatemic rickets.





other options:
options A and C: In vitamin D-resistant rickets, the renal tubule’s inability to retain phosphate results in the loss of excessive phosphate through urine. Therefore, even normal or higher
supplementations of vitamin D are not sufficient for bone mineralization.
• vitamin D-dependent Type 1 rickets is due to decreased activation of vitamin D to its active form in the kidney.
• vitamin D-dependent Type 2 rickets is due to resistance to vitamin D in peripheral tissues. This resistance to vitamin D can be overcome with high levels of this vitamin by supplementation.
option D: Nutritional rickets occur due to a deficiency of vitamin D. This leads to low calcium    levels in the blood. To raise the serum calcium, the secretion of the parathyroid hormone rises.  The parathyroid hormone tries to raise the calcium levels by reabsorbing calcium in the kidneys and secreting phosphate in exchange leading to low phosphate levels and increasing bone
resorption.",,B,5490-3508.PNG
Q8,what is this type of amputation called?,"a)Above knee amputation
b)Below knee amputation
c)knee disarticulation
d)syme’s amputation","The given image shows below-knee amputation.
By retaining the knee joint, a below-knee amputation allows for better mobility and function compared to an above-knee amputation. After surgery, patients can usually be fitted with a    prosthetic limb, enabling them to walk with a relatively normal gait.
other options:
option A: Above-knee amputation (AKA): surgical removal of the lower limb above the knee joint, typically at the femur, resulting in the loss of the knee and requiring a more complex prosthetic
for ambulation.
option C: Knee disarticulation: Amputation through the knee joint, preserving the femur while   removing the tibia and fibula, allowing for better weight-bearing but with a longer residual limb



than AKA.
option D: syme's amputation: Removal of the foot at the level of the ankle joint, preserving the heel pad for weight-bearing and creating a durable limb for ambulation without complex
prosthetics.",5473-3491.PNG,B,
Q9,"A patient complains of decreased sensation in the lateral three-and-a-half fingers on the
palmar side of the right hand, along with difficulty moving the upper phalanx of the thumb.    Examination reveals thenar atrophy. which of the following structures, when affected, lead to this presentation?","a)High radial nerve
b)High median nerve
c)High ulnar nerve
d)carpal tunnel","The most likely nerve injured here is the median nerve, which occurs in carpal tunnel syndrome.
carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common entrapment mononeuropathy caused by
compression of the median nerve as it passes through the fibro-osseous carpal tunnel beneath the flexor retinaculum. patients present with pain and paresthesia over the lateral 3 and a half digits. There may be a weakness of thumb opposition. In chronic cases, the thenar eminence is lost due   to thenar atrophy. carpal tunnel syndrome can be associated with rheumatoid arthritis,
pregnancy, chronic renal failure, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, and gout. The diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds but nerve conduction studies can confirm the diagnosis.
other tests for cTs -
• phalen's test - Elicited by holding the wrist flexed fully. The appearance of sensory symptoms within 6o seconds implies a positive test.
• Tinel's sign - sensory symptoms reproduced by percussing over the median nerve imply a positive test.
The given image shows carpal tunnel syndrome:


Non-surgical Management of carpal Tunnel syndrome: In mild to moderate cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, non-surgical management options can be explored to alleviate symptoms and improve  function. These conservative treatments include:
•



wrist splinting: wearing a wrist splint at night can help maintain the wrist in a neutral position, reducing pressure on the median nerve and providing relief from nocturnal symptoms.
•
Activity modification: Identifying and modifying activities that exacerbate symptoms can help in   managing carpal tunnel syndrome. For example, taking frequent breaks during repetitive tasks or adjusting the workstation ergonomics can be beneficial.
•
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): over-the-counter NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, can help manage pain and inflammation associated with carpal tunnel syndrome.
•
Corticosteroid injections: In some cases, corticosteroid injections into the carpal tunnel may
provide temporary relief from symptoms by reducing inflammation and pressure on the median nerve.
•
physical and occupational therapy: Therapists can help patients learn exercises to stretch and strengthen the hand and wrist muscles, improving symptoms and function.
If conservative treatments do not provide sufficient relief or the condition worsens, surgical intervention, such as carpal tunnel release surgery, may be considered.
other options:
option A: High radial nerve injuries typically cause wrist drop due to weakness in wrist and finger extensors, with sensory loss in the dorsal aspect of the hand, not the lateral three and a half
fingers on the palmar side.
option B: High median nerve injuries can affect sensation in the lateral three-and-a-half fingers
on the palmar side and impair thumb flexion and opposition, particularly at the proximal phalanx. There is a loss of pronation due to the paralysis of the pronator teres and pronator quadratus.
paralysis of flexor digitorum superficialis and lateral half flexor digitorum profundus results in loss of wrist flexion. Ape-like hand and pointing index are due to this injury.
option C: High ulnar nerve injuries result in sensory loss in the medial one-and-a-half fingers (pinky and ring finger) and hand intrinsic muscle weakness, unrelated to thenar muscle
involvement.",,D,5495-3509-1.png
Q10,patient presented with a twisting injury of the knee. Identify the test being performed.,"a)McMurray's test
b)Lachman test
c)Anterior drawer test
d)posterior drawer test","The image shows an examination being performed with the knee flexed to about 2o degrees which indicates that it is the Lachman test. The presence of free gliding indicates that it is a positive
Lachman test.
Lachman test: The patient’s knee is flexed to 2o degrees.  The lower part of the thigh is grasped with one hand and the upper part of the leg with the other hand. The joint surfaces are shifted   backward and forward upon each other.  If the knee is stable, there should be no gliding. The     presence of gliding indicates the laxity of the anterior cruciate ligament.



other options:
Anterior and posterior drawer test: The test is performed with the patient’s knees flexed to 9o
degrees, and the feet resting on the examining bed. The examiner then grasps the upper part of
the leg with both hands and rocks it forward and backward. Excessive anterior movement denotes anterior cruciate laxity (anterior drawer test) Excessive posterior movement denotes posterior
cruciate laxity (posterior drawer test).
McMurray’s test: The test is used to identify torn meniscus. The knee is flexed as far as possible and the joint is stabilized with one hand. with the other hand, the examiner rotates the leg
medially and laterally. If there is a clicking sound while rotating the leg, the test is positive. The    sound is produced due to the trapping of the loose tag of the torn meniscus between the articular surfaces.",5474-3492.PNG,B,
Q11,A child sustained a fracture after a fall. An X-ray taken after fracture management is shown below. By which of the following mechanisms will fracture healing occur?,"a)secondary healing
b)primary healing
c)creeping osteogenesis
d)Intermembranous ossification","The clinical vignette describes a child sustaining a fracture, and the X-rays show compression plating. In this case, the fracture heals through primary healing without callus formation.
The stages of fracture healing are as follows:
• Hematoma stage (up to 7 days): The periosteum and soft tissues detach from the fracture ends,  leading to ischemic necrosis. some osteocytes die from lack of blood flow, while others transform into daughter cells that aid in healing.
• Granulation Tissue stage (2-3 weeks): sensitized daughter cells differentiate into blood vessels, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts, forming soft granulation tissue that fills the fracture gap.
• callus stage (4-12 weeks): Granulation tissue differentiates into osteoblasts that produce an
intercellular matrix infused with calcium salts, forming a callus (woven bone), which is visible on X-rays around 3 weeks after the fracture.
• Remodeling stage (1-2 years): The woven bone is replaced by mature lamellar bone, known as the secondary callus, through a multicellular process of substitution.
• Modeling stage: The bone undergoes gradual strengthening and reshaping of its periosteal and  endosteal surfaces, driven by local strains from weight-bearing stresses and muscle forces during normal activities.
other options:
option A: secondary healing is more typical for fractures that have not been perfectly aligned or stabilized, where a callus is formed (soft callus forms first, followed by a hard callus as healing    progresses).
option c: creeping osteogenesis refers to the process where new bone forms along the surface of existing bone, typically seen in the context of distraction osteogenesis or in cases where there is a gap that needs to be filled.
option D: Intramembranous ossification is a type of bone formation that occurs primarily in flat bones and does not typically apply to the healing of fractures.",5475-3493.PNG,B,
Q12,A 58-year-old female patient presents with a pathological fracture of the hip and femur. Her serum calcium and phosphate are increased. DEXA scan confirms decreased bone density.   which of the following parameters will increase in this condition?,"a)Lactate dehydrogenase
b)Aspartate aminotransferase
c)Alanine transaminase
d)Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase","In this patient, the pathological fracture and elevated serum calcium and phosphate suggest a possible metabolic bone disease such as Paget’s disease of bone. The parameter likely to be
increased is TRAP (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase), which is a marker of osteoclast activity.
TRAP is an enzyme produced by osteoclasts, which are cells responsible for bone resorption.
Elevated levels of TRAP are often seen in conditions with increased bone turnover, such as Paget’s disease, hyperparathyroidism, and certain bone malignancies.",,D,
Q13,A fracture line passing through which of these will impair longitudinal growth of the bone?,"a)Epiphyseal plate
b)Epiphysis
c)Metaphysis
d)Diaphysis","A fracture line passing through the epiphyseal plate (also known as the growth plate) will impair the longitudinal growth of the bone.
The epiphyseal plate is the area of growing tissue near the ends of the long bones in children and adolescents. It is responsible for bone lengthening (longitudinal growth). If the fracture involves   the epiphyseal plate, it can disrupt this process and lead to growth disturbances or deformities.
other options:
option B: The epiphysis is the end of a long bone. while fractures involving the epiphysis can
affect joint function, they don’t directly impair longitudinal growth unless the epiphyseal plate is involved.
option C: The metaphysis is the region of bone between the diaphysis and the epiphysis, where bone growth in width occurs. A fracture here doesn’t directly impact longitudinal growth.
option D: Diaphysis describes the shaft of the bone. A diaphyseal fracture typically affects the strength and structural integrity of the bone but doesn’t impair longitudinal growth.",,A,
Q14,A 56-year-old woman presented with chronic lower back pain. MRI of the lower back shows the following findings. Identify the diagnosis.,"a)Renal osteodystrophy
b)spinal Tuberculosis
c)spinal metastasis
d)spondylolisthesis","The above clinical scenario, the history and MRI scan are suggestive of spondylolisthesis.
spondylolisthesis is the anterior displacement of a vertebra over another, usually at the lower
lumbar spine. occasionally, the displacement is backward (retrolisthesis). It is characterized by chronic back pain, lumbar lordosis, and step sign. Normally, spinous processes of adjacent
vertebrae can be palpated on the back smoothly. In spondylolisthesis, a step-off or step sign can be felt over the spinous process at the affected level.
The Beheaded scottish terrier sign (shown in the image below) on the x-ray is diagnostic. It is due to a break in the pars interarticularis of the vertebra.





It is usually managed conservatively based on symptoms with analgesics, temporary activity restriction, muscle relaxants, physical therapy, and strengthening exercises.
other options:
option A: Renal osteodystrophy is a complex condition that results from the kidneys' inability to maintain the proper levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood, leading to secondary
hyperparathyroidism. The below image represents Rugger Jersey spine which is characteristic of hyperparathyroidism seen in renal osteodystrophy.


option B: TB spine occurs secondary to a pulmonary or gastrointestinal primary and spreads through the Batson's plexus of veins (paravertebral plexus). It most commonly involves the     dorso-lumbar region.





option C: spinal metastasis: Represents the spread of malignancy to the spine, causing bone
destruction. MRI would demonstrate vertebral lesions, bone marrow involvement, or spinal cord compression, without evidence of vertebral slippage. The following image shows a radiograph of  spinal metastasis.",5476-3494.PNG,D,5495-3510.PNG;5495-3509.PNG;5496-3512.PNG;5496-3511.PNG
Q15,"A 21-year-old patient with a history of a fracture had a cast applied. on removal of the cast, the following deformity was seen. what is the most likely cause of this deformity?","a)suprachondylar humerus fracture
b)Radial fracure
c)Mid shaft fracture of humerus
d)Lateral condylar fracture","The given image shows cubitus varus deformity, where the forearm has deviated medially in
relation to the upper arm, which is a common complication of supracondylar humeral fracture.
Malunion is the commonest complication of a supracondylar fracture and results in a cubitus
varus deformity, also known as gunstock deformity. This occurs when the fracture unites with the distal fragment tilted medially and in internal rotation.



The image below shows gunstock deformity:


Cubitus varus is primarily a cosmetic concern with minimal functional impairment. Mild cases may not necessitate treatment, while severe deformities should be corrected through a lateral   closed wedge osteotomy (French osteotomy).",5476-3494-1.png,A,5496-3511-1.png
Q16,A 1o-year-old child fell down the stairs. An X-ray was done. Identify the structure injured as marked in the X-ray.,"a)Medial tubercle
b)Tibial tuberosity
c)Gerdy's tubercle
d)Anterior intercondylar area","The given X-ray points towards the tibial tuberosity. This image shows an avulsion fracture of the tibial tuberosity.
The tibial tuberosity is a bony prominence located on the anterior part of the tibia, just below the knee. It is the attachment point for the patellar tendon. Injury to the tibial tuberosity is common  in adolescents, especially those involved in sports or after trauma like a fall.
other options:
option A: The medial tubercle refers to part of the medial condyle of the tibia.
option C: Gerdy's tubercle is located on the lateral aspect of the tibia, where the iliotibial band (IT band) inserts. It is less commonly injured in falls but can be affected in conditions related to the     IT band, like IT band syndrome.
option D: Anterior intercondylar area is an area is located between the medial and lateral
condyles of the tibia and serves as an attachment point for the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Injuries in this region are more commonly associated with ACL tears.",5477-3495.PNG,B,
