Q2,There is an outbreak of buboes in the community. what is the vector responsible for this condition?,"a)xenopsylla cheopis
b)phlebotomus argentipes
c)Ixodes tick
d)Female Anopheles mosquito","The vector for bubonic plague is xenopsylla cheopis. It is also called a rat flea. It also transmits    murine typhus, chiggerosis, and hymenolepsis diminuta. It can be identified by the presence of a conical-shaped head, the presence of thorax, abdomen, and three pairs of legs.
plague is a zoonotic disease caused by yersinia pestis. It is a gram-negative, non-motile,
coccobacillus that exhibits bipolar staining with special stains like wayson's stain. The reservoir of infections is wild rodents like field mice, gerbils, skunks, etc. In India, Tatera indica is the main
reservoir. The important vector of plague is rat flea, also called xenopsylla cheopis.
Humans acquire the disease by the bite of an infected flea, by direct contact with the tissues of the infected animal, or by droplet infection from cases of pneumonic plague.
Human plague mainly presents as:
Bubonic plague- This is the most common type of disease. The patient develops a sudden fever, chills, headache, and painful lymphadenitis. within a few days, the lymph nodes in the groin,    axilla, or neck enlarge and are called buboes. This is followed by the suppuration of the buboes. Bubonic plague cannot spread from person to person as the bacilli are locked up in the buboes   and do not find a way or easy exit.
pneumonic plague- It develops as a complication of bubonic-septicemic plague.
septicemic plague- It occurs when the infection spreads to blood.
other options
option B- species phlebotomus argentipes, belongs to the group of sand fly. It transmits kala azar. Diseases caused by other species of sand flies are sandfly fever and oriental sore.

Q3,The pathanamthitta district of kerala was affected by floods and the government distributed doxycycline tablets for prophylaxis. which other chemical will be distributed along with it?,"a)zinc phosphide
b)Malathion
c)Lindane
d)paris green","Leptospirosis, followed by acute diarrhoeal diseases and dengue are most commonly prevalent following floods in kerala. Malathion will be the choice of insecticide used in this scenario.
Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonotic disease transmitted via water contaminated with rodent
urine. Infected rodents excrete large amounts of leptospira in their urine and floods facilitate the



spread of the organism.
prevention of leptospirosis:
• chemoprophylaxis with Doxycycline 2oo mg once a week for 6 weeks is recommended for
high-risk populations in endemic areas. In case of fever, Doxycycline 1oo mg twice a day for seven days is the recommended dose.
• Rubber shoes and gloves should be used.
• Anti-rodent measures must be taken.
• Mapping of water bodies must be done to establish a proper drainage system.
other diseases usually transmitted after floods are typhoid fever, malaria, cholera, hepatitis A &amp; E.
General measures to control disease spread during floods are:
• chlorine tablets are distributed to disinfect the household water supply. one tablet can
chlorinate 2o liters of water. Drinking water disinfectants like bleaching powder are also used.
• Malathion is an organophosphorus synthetic insecticide used for vector control (adult
mosquitoes). It is a contact poison that is sprayed using ultra-light volume fogging machines.
• Indoor residual sprays with insecticides and larvicides like abate for drinking water are recommended.
• Tetanus booster dose for previously vaccinated people with open injuries may be indicated.
• General hygiene and sanitary measures must be followed.
other health risks posed by floods are hypothermia, respiratory tract infections, snake bites, and injuries/drowning.
other options:
option A: zinc phosphide is a rodenticide used to kill animals like mice and rats. It is a highly toxic compound and can produce toxicity by oral ingestion, inhalation, and through damaged  skin.
option c: Lindane is used as an insecticide for hardwood logs, lumber, and crops. It also has topical pediculicidal and scabicidal activities and is used in pet treatment.
option D: paris green is an insecticide that is not much used due to the availability of lesser phytotoxic agents.",,B,

Q6,There is an outbreak of acute encephalitis in the community and a vaccination drive is launched. which of the following is true about the vaccine given in this condition?,"a)Live and subcutaneous
b)killed and intramuscular
c)Live and intramuscular
d)killed and subcutaneous","The given scenario is suggestive of Japanese encephalitis for which a killed vaccine is
administered intramuscularly.
The Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is transmitted by the bite of culex mosquitoes, specifically culex tritaeniorhynchus and culex vishnui (common in India) species. They present with fever
and headache in mild disease form. still, severe disease presents with rapid onset of high fever,
headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, and ultimately death.
killed JE vaccines (Inactivated sA 14-14-2 cell culture-derived and inactivated vero cell
culture-derived) are gradually replacing live attenuated vaccines. This change is because the killed vaccines are reported to have better immunogenicity than the live attenuated vaccine.
The sA 14-14-2 (live attenuated) vaccine is based on a stable neuro-attenuated strain of the JE  virus with a yellow Fever vaccine acting as a viral vector. Adverse effects of the vaccine include fever and rash.
Dose: o.5 ml
site:  Live vaccine: subcutaneous, left upper arm
killed vaccine: Intramuscular, anterolateral side of left mid-thigh
They can be administered up to 15 years of age with a month gap between the two doses.
The JE virus vaccine has been included in the National Immunization schedule (NIs) to be
administered in endemic areas (uttar pradesh, Assam, west Bengal, karnataka) in two doses. The first dose is administered at 9-12 completed months. The second dose is administered at 16-24
months. The schedule however mentions the use of both live and killed vaccines.
Note: According to the national immunisation schedule, both live attenuated, killed-inactivated vaccines are now used for vaccination against the JE virus.",,B,
Q7,The evaluation based on the treatment given to the patient and their clinical management in a health care facility measures which of the following?,"a)outcome
b)process
c)structure
d)Input","The evaluation based on the treatment given to the patient and their clinical management in a health care facility measures the ""process"" of medical care.
The basic steps of evaluation are as follows :



• Determine what is to be evaluated
• Establish standards and criteria
• plan the methodology to be applied
• Gather information
• Analyze the results
• Take action
• Re-evaluate
The three types of evaluation are:
• Evaluation of ""structure"": This is an evaluation of whether facilities, equipment, manpower, and organization meet a standard approved by experts.
• Evaluation of ""process"": The process of medical care includes the problems of recognition,
diagnostic procedures, treatment and clinical management, care, and prevention. They are
evaluated by comparing with a predetermined standard. Eg; Evaluation of the physician (or nurse) performance is known as ""Medical (or nursing) Audit"".
• Evaluation of ""outcome"": This is concerned with the benefits gained by people using the health   services. The traditional outcome components are the ""5 Ds"" of ill-health, i.e; disease, discomfort, dissatisfaction, disability, and death.
Elements of evaluation are relevance, adequacy, accessibility, acceptability, effectiveness, efficiency and impact.",,B,

other options :
option A - killed IpV is a form of killed/inactivated vaccine where the absolute contraindication is a severe local or general reaction to a previous dose.
options c and D - DpT and TT/Td fall under toxoids/protein vaccines that are usually highly efficacious and safe immunizing agents.",,B,
Q9,which of the following is a conditioning influence for malnutrition?,"a)Child rearing
b)Infectious diseases
c)Food habits
d)socioeconomic factors","From the given options, infectious diseases are the conditioning influence for malnutrition.
Ecology of Malnutrition :
The ecological factors related to malnutrition as follows
• conditioning influences: A conditioning factor that plays a huge role in malnutrition is infectious diseases which causes a vicious cycle where infections cause malnutrition which in turn causes
minor childhood ailments. Diarrhoeal diseases, intestinal parasites, measles, whooping cough,  malaria, tuberculosis contributes significantly to malnutrition. The occurrence of infections are largely based on the environmental conditions that the child is exposed to.
• cultural influences: poor diets as a result of cultural and regional influences also play a role in malnutrition. They are as follows with an example for each:
• Food habits, traditions, customs, beliefs and attitudes: Rice and wheat are largely staple in India.
papaya is avoided as it is thought to cause abortion.
• Food fads: personal likes and dislikes to a certain group of foods.
• cooking practices: prolonged boiling of cereals in open pans which leads to a loss of nutritive value
• child-rearing practices: premature curtailment of breastfeeding
• socio-economic factors: poverty plays a huge role in causing malnutrition. This is usually a result of ignorance, insufficient education, lack of knowledge regarding the nutritive value of foods,
inadequate sanitary environment, large family size, etc. which affects the quality of life.
• Food production: The amount of food produced is directly proportional to the amount of food    consumed. Developed countries have 5.8 hectares of arable land compared to the o.6 hectares of land per Indian. Even distribution of food among all sectors of society is also a factor.
• Health and other services: Remedial actions that can be taken by the health sector to reduce malnutrition are as follows -
• Nutritional surveillance - continuous monitoring of factors that affect nutrition; groups affected are identified.
• Nutritional rehabilitation - urgent care for individuals suffering from severe malnutrition.



• Nutrition supplementation - Supplementary feeds for mothers and children
• Health education - Health education programmes to increase awareness about malnutrition and nutrition value of food.",,B,
Q10,which of the following is not a component of the global hunger index (GHI)?,"a)Infant mortality rate
b)under 5 mortality
c)Percentage of undernourished population
d)Percentage of undernourished children under 5 years","The infant mortality rate is not a component of the global hunger index.
The Global Hunger Index (GHI) has three dimensions. These dimensions are measured by indicators.
GHI score = (1/3 X standardized PUN) + (1/6 X standardised CWA) + (1/6 X standardised CST) + (1/3 X Standardised CM)
Where,
• PUN is the proportion of the population that is undernourished
• CWA is the prevalence of wasting in children under 5 years of age
• CST is the prevalence of stunting in children under 5 years of age
• CM is the proportion of children dying under the age of 5 years of age.
The result lies on a scale from o to 1oo, with o meaning no hunger and 1oo being the worst score. The GHI is given by the International Food Policy Research Institute. In 2o21, India's GHI was
27.5. It ranks 1o1 among 116 countries. In the 2o22,India's GHI stands at 29.1, and India ranks 1o7th out of the 121 countries.

Q11,"A researcher wants to know whether there is an association of CRP values with the risk of  myocardial infarction/stroke. The study group was divided into quintiles and the following table is formed based on the study results. which of the following statements is true
regarding the relationship between CRP and the risk of myocardial infarction/stroke?","a)CRP has no association with risk of MI/stroke
b)Increase in CRP increases the risk of MI/stroke
c)Increase in CRP decreases the risk of MI/stroke
d)In quintile 1, there is no risk of MI/stroke","From the study results, option B is the true statement i.e; an increase in the CRP increases the risk of myocardial infarction/stroke.
Relative risk (RR)/risk ratio is the ratio of the incidence of the disease (or death) among exposed and the incidence among non-exposed.
Incidence of disease (or death) among exposed
RR=   Incidence of disease (or death) among non-exposed



It is a direct measure of the strength of the association between suspected cause and effect. The larger the RR, the greater the strength of the association between the suspected factor and
disease. As there is an increase in the RR with increasing CRP levels, the risk of an MI/stroke also increases with elevated CRP levels.
RR = 1 indicates no association.
RR &gt;1 indicates a positive association.
RR of 2 or higher indicates a &gt;/=1oo% increase in risk. Relative risk calculation (RR) = [ a/(a+b) ]/ c/(c+d)] where,
In the question, the table shows an increase in relative risk with an increase in CRP values. This thereby indicates that an increase in the CRP values increases the risk of myocardial
infarction/stroke.
Note: Relative risk provides information on the increase or decrease in the likelihood of a
condition based on exposure. It does not provide the absolute risk of the event occurring. The last option states that ""In quintile 1 there is no risk of MI/stroke"". Even though the relative risk is 1, it  only indicates no association but does not exclude the occurrence of MI/ stroke.

Q14,A pregnant woman whose niece lives with her in the same house contracted varicella. she tested negative for serum antibodies against varicella. what would this mean?,"a)she is immune to zoster
b)she is susceptible to zoster
c)she is susceptible to chicken pox
d)she is immune to chicken pox","The given clinical scenario showing the absence of serum antibodies is indicative of susceptibility to chickenpox.
Varicella zoster virus causes two host responses which present as chickenpox and herpes zoster.    They are characterized by a vesicular rash that is accompanied by fever and malaise (chickenpox). The immune system eliminates the infection except for some virions that establish latent
infections inside nerve cells which are reactivated when immunity is compromised and present as herpes zoster.
one attack with the virus gives durable immunity while a second attack of the virus is rare. In the absence of immunity, all ages are equally susceptible to the disease. The acquisition of maternal    antibodies protects the infant during the first few months of life. The IgG antibodies produced
during the first attack with the virus persist for life and their presence is correlated with
protection against varicella. The absence of antibodies in the given scenario signifies that the
patient is susceptible to chicken pox. Hence, the serologic screening of serum for lgG antibodies is used to assess immunity or susceptibility of a person to varicella, especially in unvaccinated
people, e.g. in healthcare workers.
The presence of cell-mediated immunity appears to be important in the recovery from Vz    infections and in protection against the reactivation of latent Vz virus which causes Herpes zoster.
Varicella in pregnant women :
The contraction of the virus by a pregnant woman increases the risk of the fetus to congenital varicella syndrome. This is seen in mothers who are affected during the first 2o weeks of
gestation. Affected babies present with the following :
• Foetal wastage
• cutaneous scars
• Atrophied limbs
• Microcephaly
• Low birth weight
• cataract
• Microphthalmia



• chorioretinitis
• Deafness
• cerebra-cortical atrophy
prevention:
• Varicella-Zoster lmmunoglobulin (VZIG) is given as post-exposure prophylaxis within 72 hours of exposure and has been recommended for prevention of chickenpox in exposed susceptible
individuals particularly in immunosuppressed persons such as:
• persons receiving immunosuppressive therapy
• persons with congenital cellular immunodeficiency
• persons with acquired immunodeficiency including HIV/AIDs
• Exposed pregnant women
• Newborns
• premature infants oflow birth weight
• Live attenuated vaccine is administered to children who have not had chicken pox between the age of 12 to 18 months.",,C,
Q15,The school health programs are managed by which of the following?,"a)primary health center
b)District hospital
c)sub-centre
d)sub-divisional hospital","The school health programs are managed by the primary health centre (pHc).
The school Health committee (1961) in India recommended that the school health services should be a part of the general health services. since the general health services are administered through pHcs, school health programs are also managed by the pHcs under their jurisdiction.
The school Health committee advocated the formation of school health committees at the village level, block level, district level, state level, and national level. The National school Health council will be an advisory and coordinating body.
pHcs provide the following school health services:
• screening of general health assessment of anemia/nutritional status, visual acuity, hearing
problem, dental check-up, physical disabilities, learning disorders, and behavior problems, etc.
• Basic medicines for common ailments
• Immunization
• Micronutrient (Vitamin A, iron, and folic acid) management
• Deworming

Q16,"A man from Chattisgarh presented with progressive muscle weakness and leg spasms. Pure
motor paresis was seen on examination. what is the most appropriate history to be elicited in this patient?","a)History of similar illness in the past
b)History of fever
c)History of vaccination
d)History of diet","The given clinical features are suggestive of neurolathyrism and excessive consumption of the
pulse Lathyrus sativus is the main cause. Hence, a diet history should be elicited in this patient to confirm the diagnosis.
Lathyrism is a paralyzing disease of humans and animals. It is due to the consumption of khesari dal/Lathyrus sativus. When the husk is removed, it looks similar to red gram dal or Bengal gram   dal. It is more prevalent in parts of Madhya pradesh, uttar pradesh, odisha, and Bihar.
In humans, it is referred to as neurolathyrism because it affects the nervous system. It
is characterized by gradually developing spastic paralysis of the lower limbs.
In animals, it is referred to as osteolathyrism/odoratism because the pathological changes in the bones lead to skeletal deformities.
It usually affects young males aged 15-45 years and it is manifested in stages:
• Latent stage
• No-stick stage
• one-stick stage
• Two-stick stage
• Crawler stage
BoAA (Beta oxalyl amino alanine) is the toxic compound causing Lathyrism. The water-soluble property of the toxin is used in removing it from the pulses by soaking it in hot water and
rejecting the soaked water.
parboiling can be used for detoxifying the crop on large-scale operations. overnight soaking in lime water followed by boiling is also effective in destroying the toxin.
vitamin C in doses of 5oo-1ooomg can be used for the prevention and treatment of lathyrism.
The prevention of Food Adulteration Act in India has banned Lathyrus sativus in all forms (whole/split/flour).",,D,
