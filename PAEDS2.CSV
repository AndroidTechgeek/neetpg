Q1,which of the following is not an indicator of fetal lung maturity?,"a)Lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio &gt; 2.5
b)positive shake test
c)Increased phosphatidyl glycerol
d)Nile blue test showing &gt;5o% of blue cells","Nile blue test showing &gt;5o% orange cells is a sign of fetal lung maturity, not blue cells.
Tests for the assessment of fetal lung maturity include:
The Nile blue test involves staining desquamated fetal cells from amniotic fluid with o.1% Nile blue sulfate. The presence of orange cells &gt; 5o% suggests lung
maturity. Lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio at 31 to 32 weeks is 1, and at 35 weeks ratio is 2. The ratio ≥2 indicates lung maturity (option A).
The shake test or bubble test (clement's test) (option B) involves mixing amniotic fluid with 95% ethanol, shaking it for 15 seconds, and observing it for 15 minutes. A complete ring of bubbles at the meniscus is a positive test and indicates lung maturity. This is a useful bedside test.
The presence of phosphatidylglycerol, (option c) saturated phosphatidylcholine and lamellar body count (&gt;5o,ooo/mcL) indicates lung maturity.
Glucocorticoids accelerate lung maturation and lower the incidence of respiratory distress and
neonatal mortality in preterms if the birth was delayed for at least 24 hours after initiation of
betamethasone. A single course of corticosteroids is recommended for women between 24 and 36  weeks who are at risk of delivery within 7 days. Intramuscular injections of either 2 doses of 12 mg betamethasone are given 24 hourly or 4 doses of 6 mg dexamethasone are given 12 hourly.",,D,
Q2,How long should a child be isolated after being diagnosed with bacterial meningitis to prevent further transmission?,"a)Till 24 hours after starting antibiotics
b)Till cultures become negative
c)Till antibiotic course is complete
d)Till 12 hours after admission","Isolation of the child is recommended until 24 hrs after the initiation of effective therapy after being diagnosed with acute bacterial meningitis to prevent further transmission.
Droplet precautions are recommended for patients with Neisseria meningitides and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) meningitis until they have received 24 hours of effective therapy. patients  should be in private rooms, and hospital personnel should wear a face mask when they are within 3 feet (1 meter) of the patient.
The child with meningitis shows nonspecific symptoms like fever, anorexia, poor feeding,
headache, myalgia, hypotension, petechia, purpura, or a rash. Meningial irritation is indicated by nuchal rigidity, back pain, and kernig, and Brudzinski signs (usually not seen in infants).
seizures and altered mental status may be present.
The recommended empirical antibiotic regimen in a suspected case of meningitis outside the
neonatal period is vancomycin combined with a third-generation cephalosporin. patients allergic to penicillin or cephalosporin can be treated with meropenem, fluoroquinolones, or
chloramphenicol.
chemoprophylaxis with rifampicin/ceftriaxone/ciprofloxacin is recommended for all close contacts with meningococcal meningitis regardless of age or immunization status. Rifampicin prophylaxis   should be given to all household contacts of patients with invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b, if an immunocompromised child of any age resides in the household or close
family member younger than 48 months has not been fully immunized.",,A,
Q3,choose the correct order of suctioning during neonatal resuscitation.,"a)Mouth-nose
b)Nose-mouth
c)Mouth-nose-oesophagus
d)Trachea-nose-mouth","During neonatal resuscitation, the mouth is suctioned first and then the nares, in order
to decrease the risk of aspiration. A 12 or 14 French suction catheter is used, with the suction pressure kept between 8o-1oommHg.
Routine suctioning of the trachea during neonatal resuscitation is not recommended.
The suctioning of the esophagus and stomach is avoided if not indicated specifically, as it can produce a vagal response due to stimulation in the posterior pharynx, resulting in
apnea and/or bradycardia.
The steps in neonatal resuscitation follow the ABcs, Airway, Breathing, and circulation.
The neonatal resuscitation algorithm is given below:


chest compression should be initiated over the lower third of the sternum at a rate of 9o/minutes. The ratio of chest compression to ventilation is 3: 1 (9o compressions: 3o breaths). The thumb
technique (preferred) and 2 finger technique are the two different techniques used for performing chest compression. umbilical vein cannulation is the preferred method for the administration of   medications.",,A,5522-3526.PNG
Q4,"An adolescent girl complaints of dropping objects from hands precipitated during morning  hours and exams. There is no history of loss of consciousness. one of her cousins has been  diagnosed with epilepsy. EEG was suggestive of epileptic spikes. what is the most probable
diagnosis?","a)Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy
b)Atypical absence
c)choreo-athetoid epilepsy
d)centrotemporal spikes","The given clinical scenario describes an adolescent girl with myoclonic jerks (a history of dropping objects) with preserved consciousness. This, along with abnormal EEG findings strongly suggests   juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.
Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Janz syndrome) is the most common generalized epilepsy in young adults. It starts in early adolescence with one or more of the following features: bilateral
myoclonic jerks in the morning, causing patients to drop things, generalized tonic-clonic or



clonic-tonic-clonic seizures upon awakening, and juvenile absence seizure.
consciousness is usually preserved. precipitating factors include sleep deprivation, alcohol, and  photic stimulation. EEG shows 4 to 5Hz polyspike and slow wave discharges. A family history of epilepsy is often present.
The treatment options for JME include sodium valproate, levetiracetam, and
topiramate. Benzodiazepine, lamotrigine, perampanel, phenobarbital, primidone, and zonisamide can be considered as add-on drugs. complete remission is uncommon and has a high risk of
seizure recurrence, hence antiepileptics are continued lifelong in a majority of the patients.
other options:
option B: Atypical absence seizures have been associated with myoclonic components and head drop. They are precipitated by drowsiness and EEG shows 1 to 2 Hz spike and slow wave
discharges.
option D: In benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, the child typically wakes at night due to a focal seizure with preserved awareness. Buccal and throat tingling and tonic or     clonic contractions on one side of the face are seen, with drooling and preserved consciousness. EEG shows typical wide-based centrotemporal spikes.",,A,
Q5,A newborn female presents with continuous dribbling of urine. The image below shows the pathology from which the patient is suffering. The most likely diagnosis is:,"a)Gastroschisis
b)Bladder exstrophy
c)superior vesical fissure
d)Anterior ectopic anus","Neonate with continuous urine dribbling a protruding bladder with exposed mucosa suggests bladder exstrophy.
In bladder exstrophy, the bladder protrudes from the abdominal wall, and its mucosa is exposed. The umbilicus is displaced downwards, the pubic rami are widely separated and the rectus
muscles are separated. Anomalies of the bladder occur when the mesoderm fails to invade the   cephalad extension of the cloacal membrane, the extent of this failure determines the degree of the anomaly.
Males commonly have complete epispadias with dorsal chordee, undescended testes, short penis, and inguinal hernia. Epispadias with separation of the two halves of the clitoris and wide
separation of labia is seen in females. Anus is displaced anteriorly in both sexes. Rectal prolapse may be seen.
Management involves a staged surgical reconstruction of the bladder and genitalia. untreated patients may develop total urinary incontinence and an increased incidence of bladder
adenocarcinoma.
other exstrophy anomalies are cloacal exstrophy and epispadias. cloacal exstrophy (ileocaecal
exstrophy) is a rare condition, in which there is a small exomphalos with an everted caecum and    ileum separating halves of the bladder and in males, a split penis. The hindgut is truncated (giving tusks on the face of the elephant appearance).





other options:
option A: Gastroschisis is a condition where the intestinal loops herniate through the defect in the abdominal wall (shown below). The defect usually lies on one side of the umbilicus (right side
commonly). The loops ofthe bowel are not covered by amnion as they herniate through the
abdominal wall directly into the amniotic cavity. It is associated with elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels.


option D: Mild forms of the imperforate anus are often called anal stenosis or an anterior ectopic anus.",5516-3523.PNG,B,5524-3528.PNG;5524-3527.PNG
Q6,The absence of which of the following milestones in a 3-year-old child is called as developmental delay?,"a)Hopping on one leg
b)Drawing a square
c)Feeding by spoon
d)passing a ball to someone","Feeding by spoon is a social milestone that typically appears by 18 months. If this is absent, then the child should be termed as having a developmental delay. Hopping on one leg, drawing a
square, and passing a ball to someone appear by 48 months of age.
Red flag signs in developmental screening and surveillance are indicators that suggest a serious disorder in a child's development, requiring referral to a pediatrician. These are given below:
positive indicators: presence of any of the following
• Loss of developmental skills at any age
• concerns about vision or confirmed visual impairment
• Hearing loss at any age
• persistently low muscle tone
• Lack of speech by 18 months without other means of communication
• Asymmetry of movements or features suggestive of cerebral palsy
• persistent toe walking
• complex disabilities
• unusual head circumference compared to norms
• clinician uncertainty about the developmental disorder.
Negative Indicators:
• Inability to sit unsupported by 12 months
• Inability to walk by 18 months in boys or 2 years in girls.
• Inability to walk normally
• Inability to run by 2.5 years
• Inability to hold objects in hand by 5 months or reach for them by 6 months.
• Inability to point at objects to share interest by 2 years",,C,
Q7,"A 2-year-old child with a history of fall 1 year back with parietal bone fracture, has now presented with a painful and growing parietal swelling. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Growing scalp hematoma
b)Growing fracture
c)subdural hygroma
d)chronic abscess","The clinical presentation of a child with a painful and growing parietal swelling, coupled with a
history of a prior parietal bone fracture one year ago, strongly suggests the diagnosis of a growing fracture, also known as traumatic encephalocele or leptomeningeal cysts.
skull fractures associated with a dural tear may fail to heal properly. The herniated brain, dilated ventricles, or a leptomeningeal cyst may cause an enlargement of this tear. These fractures are
called growing skull fractures. They are usually seen in children &lt; 3 years of age.
They present as a localized swelling or palpable skull defect that increases in size, most commonly seen in the parietal region. However, they may go undetected for years and present with delayed    onset of neurologic symptoms (headache, seizure, or neurologic deficit).
other options:



option A: The extended duration of one year makes scalp hematoma unlikely, as it usually resolves within a few months.
option c: subdural hygromas are characterized by fluid accumulation in the subdural space. Most patients with subdural hygromas are asymptomatic, but uncommon symptoms may include
headaches, changes in mental status, nausea and vomiting, focal neurological deficits, and seizures. They don't present with scalp swelling.
option D: chronic abscess may show inflammatory changes like erythema, pus, sinus, and systemic features like fever.",,B,
Q8,"After the delivery of an infant of a diabetic mother, the blood glucose of the Infant was 6o mg/dl. which other investigation would you do?","a)serum potassium
b)serum sodium
c)serum chloride
d)serum calcium","In an infant of a diabetic mother with normal blood glucose levels, the next investigation to
consider is serum calcium due to the high risk of developing hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia in these infants is attributed to the delayed response of the parathyroid hormone system.
Hypocalcemia is defined as a total serum calcium concentration of less than 8 mg/dL for a term baby (ionized calcium below 4mg/dL) and less than 7 mg/dL for a preterm baby. Asymptomatic  neonates can be managed conservatively with early nutrition. symptomatic neonates should
receive iv or oral calcium replacement.
Maternal hyperglycemia causes fetal hyperglycemia, and the fetal pancreatic response leads to
fetal hyperinsulinemia, which causes neonatal hypoglycemia. Neonatal hypoglycemia is defined as blood glucose &lt;4o mg/dL (plasma glucose &lt;45 mg/dL). The infant tends to be jittery,
tremulous, hyperexcitable, hypotonic, lethargic, and poor sucking during the 1st three days after  birth. These symptoms can also be related to hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia which occur in the 1st 24 to 72 hours of life.
Respiratory distress syndrome, macrosomia, hyperbilirubinemia, polycythemia, renal vein  thrombosis, visceromegaly, heart failure, and persistent pulmonary hypertension are other features seen in infants of diabetic mothers.
congenital anomalies are seen in infants of mothers with pregestational diabetes. Neural tube   defects (Encephalocele, meningomyelocele, anencephaly), transposition of great vessels (TGA), ventricular septal defect (VsD), atrial septal defect (AsD), hypoplastic left heart, aortic stenosis and coarctation of the aorta are commonly seen.
caudal regression syndrome is rare, but a specific anomaly seen in infants of diabetic mothers. small left colon syndrome is a rare anomaly that develops in the second and third trimesters.",,D,
Q9,You have been called to declare the brain death of a 12-year-old child in the IcU. which of the following is not seen in brain death?,"a)Normal BP without pharmacological support
b)Positive spinal reflexes on stimulation
c)sweating and tachycardia
d)Decorticate and decerebrate posturing","Decerebrate or decorticate posturing is not seen in brain death as they are motor responses to noxious stimuli that originate from the midbrain and cortex.
Brain death, also known as death by neurologic criteria refers to the irreversible and total cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brainstem.



The three components for diagnosing brain death are a demonstration of coexisting irreversible
coma with a known cause, absence of brain stem reflexes, and apnea. coma requires the patient to be unresponsive, even to noxious stimuli. The diagnosis of brain death can still be made despite
positive spinal reflexes. (option B)
Brainstem reflexes (pupillary responses, oculocephalic reflex, oculovestibular responses, corneal reflex, jaw reflex, facial grimacing, pharyngeal gag reflex, coughing) are absent. Apnea is the
absence of respiratory drive at paco2 of ≥6ommHg and &gt; 2ommHg above baseline, which is consistent with brain death.
The following manifestations are occasionally seen and should not be misinterpreted as evidence of brainstem function:
• Normal systolic blood pressure - sBp &gt;1oo mmHg (option A)
• Movements originating from the spinal cord or peripheral nerve may occur
• sweating, flushing, tachycardia (option c)
• Deep tendon reflexes; superficial abdominal reflexes; triple flexion response
• Babinski reflex
• spontaneous movements of limbs other than pathologic flexion or extension response
• Respiratory-like movements (shoulder elevation and adduction, back-arching, intercostal expansion without significant tidal volumes)",,D,
Q10,craniopagus is defined as the fusion of_______.,"a)Head and spine
b)Head only
c)Thorax and spine
d)Thorax only","craniopagus is a type of conjoint twin where there is a fusion of the head or cranium.
Foramen magnum or the skull base never fuses in the case of craniopagus. They usually will have fused skulls and meninges. A shared cerebral cortex may occasionally be found.
craniopagus has an incidence of 5%, and separation of the twins has a poor prognosis.
Dizygotic/fraternal twins result from the fertilization of two separate ova. Monozygotic/identical      twins arise from the division of a single fertilized ovum. The outcome of the monozygotic twinning process depends on when division occurs.
Types of conjoined twins:
• Thoracopagus: united at the thorax
• craniopagus: united at the head
• cephalothoracopagus: fusion of both head and thorax
• omphalopagous or xiphipagous: united anteriorly from the xiphoid to the umbilicus
• parapagus: lateral fusion with two heads, sharing a single thorax, abdomen, and pelvis
• Ischiopagus: united at the pelvis
• pygopagus: united in the sacral region
• Heteropagous: asymmetric forms



The image below shows the types of conjoined twins:

Monozygotic types	Time of zygote division

Q11,which of the following hormones is the major product of the fetal adrenal glands?,"a)DHEA
b)cortisol
c)corticosterone
d)Progesterone","The major steroid products of the fetal adrenal gland are DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) and DHEA-S.
They serve as important substrates for estrogen synthesis in the placenta.
The fetal-adrenal-placental axis is vital for normal childbirth. placental corticotropin-releasing hormone (cRH) stimulates the fetal adrenal gland to produce DHEA-S and cortisol. cortisol     further stimulates the production of placental cRH, creating a positive feedback loop that
enhances adrenal steroid hormone production.
The steroid products released by the fetal adrenal gland have effects on the placenta and
membranes. These effects contribute to transforming the myometrium from a quiescent to a contractile state.
congenital adrenal hyperplasia is an autosomal recessive condition in which cortisol synthesis in the adrenal gland is affected. cortisol deficiency increases the secretion of AcTH, which leads to  adrenocortical hyperplasia and overproduction of intermediate metabolites.",,A,5529-3530.PNG
Q12,"A 2-day-old neonate was admitted to the NIcU after he was observed to have movements as    shown in the clip. His APGAR scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. His blood sugar was within the normal range in the first 24 hours. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Focal tonic seizure
b)Focal clonic seizure
c)spasms
d)subtle seizure","The video clip of a 2-day-old neonate exhibiting repetitive, rhythmic movement in unilateral upper and lower limbs suggests a neonatal seizure of focal clonic type.
A focal clonic seizure is characterized by multiple, repetitive, rhythmic contractions of muscle     groups of the limbs, face, or trunk, maybe unifocal or multifocal. It may occur synchronously or asynchronously in muscle groups on one side of the body. It may occur simultaneously but
asynchronously on both sides. It cannot be suppressed by restraint.
other options:
option A: Focal tonic seizures are characterized by sustained posturing of a single limb, sustained asymmetrical posturing of the trunk, and sustained eye deviation. They cannot be provoked by
stimulation or suppressed by restraint.
option C: spasms are sudden generalized jerks lasting 1-2 sec and are usually associated with a
single, very brief, generalized discharge. They may be flexor, extensor, or mixed extensor/flexor     and can occur in clusters. They too cannot be provoked by stimulation or suppressed by restraint.
option D: subtle seizures include transient eye deviations, nystagmus, blinking, mouthing,
abnormal extremity movements (rowing, swimming, cycling, pedalling), fluctuations in heart rate, hypertension episodes, and apnea. They are more common in preterm than in term babies.
Myoclonic seizures are random, single, rapid muscle contractions of the limbs, face, or trunk.
They are not repetitive or may recur at a slow rate. They can be generalized, focal, or fragmentary. They can be provoked by stimulation.
Clinically apparent seizures in a neonate should be treated if they last &gt;3 minutes or are brief serial seizures. In all neonates with seizures, hypoglycemia, CNs infection, and hypocalcemia
should be ruled out before starting anti-epileptic drug treatment.

Q13,"A male child with coarse facies, macroglossia, thick lips with hepatosplenomegaly presents with copious mucous discharge from the nose. The most probable underlying diagnosis is","a)Hurler disease
b)Beckwith-wiedemann syndrome
c)proteus syndrome
d)Hypothyroidism","The given clinical scenario of a child with coarse facies, macroglossia, thick lips,
hepatosplenomegaly, and copious discharge from the nose is suggestive of Hurler's disease.
It is the severe form of mucopolysaccharidoses type 1 (MPs 1), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in α-L iduronidase, leading to the accumulation of heparan sulfate and
dermatan sulfate. The child usually presents between 6 and 24 months with hepatosplenomegaly, coarse facial features (shown below), corneal clouding, large tongue, prominent forehead, joint
stiffness, short stature, and skeletal dysplasia.
Most patients have recurrent upper respiratory tract and ear infections, noisy breathing, and persistent copious nasal discharge. Radiograph shows skeletal dysplasia, called dysostosis
multiplex - thick ribs, ovoid vertebral bodies, enlarged and trabeculated diaphyses of the long bones with irregular metaphysis and epiphysis.
Macrocephaly, enlarged J-shaped sella, premature closure of lambdoid sagittal sutures, and shallow orbits are seen with disease progression. obstructive airway disease, cardiac
complications, and respiratory infections are the common causes of death.
The image below shows the radiograph shows enlarged diaphyses ofthe metacarpal and phalanges.






other options:
option B: Beckwith-wiedemann syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome characterized by
macrosomia, macroglossia, hemihypertrophy, omphalocele, and renal anomalies. It is associated   with an increased risk of wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and adrenal cortical carcinoma.
option c: proteus syndrome is a disturbance of cellular growth involving ectodermal and
mesodermal tissues, caused by mutation in the AKT1 gene. They present with
hemimegalencephaly, asymmetric overgrowth of the extremities, verrucous cutaneous lesions, thickening of the bone, and excessive growth of muscles.
option D: A child with untreated congenital hypothyroidism may have stunted growth, short extremities, narrow palpebral fissures, swollen eyelids, depressed nasal bridge, thick broad    protruded tongue, and short and thick neck, dry and scaly skin.",,A,5530-3531.PNG

Q15,"A preterm infant in the NICU was observed to have marked nasal flare, distinct xiphoid
retractions, minimal intercostal retractions, and inspiratory lag with an audible grunt. what would be the silverman Anderson score?","a)1o
b)7
c)8
d)9","The silverman-Anderson score of the child would be 8.
calculation of the silverman-Anderson score of this child:
Total score: 8
A score of more than 7 indicates respiratory failure.
The silverman-Anderson score is a commonly used score to assess respiratory distress. It helps to assess the progression of distress over time and initiate treatment. It is more suited for preterms   with respiratory distress syndrome. scoring is to be done every half an hour and charting is
carried out to monitor progress.

Q16,True regarding the difference between adult and pediatric resuscitation.,"a)ventricular dysrhythmias are common in children
b)The no flow phase precedes the period of cardiac arrest in children.
c)More ventilation to be given compared to chest compressions in children
d)Dysrhythmias are most often due to respiratory insufficiency in children","Dysrhythmias in the pediatric age group are most often the result of respiratory insufficiency or hypoxia and not of primary cardiac causes, as in adults.



Hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis lead to bradycardia, hypotension, and secondary cardiac arrest in children.
other options:
option A: Supraventricular tachycardia is the most common tachydysrhythmia that necessitates treatment in pediatric patients. ventricular dysrhythmia is an uncommon presenting rhythm in  infants and children.
option B: The pre-arrest phase is the period that precedes the period of cardiac arrest.
Four phases of cardiac arrest have been described as follows:
• The prearrest phase- a period that precedes the period of cardiac arrest.
• The no-flow phase- reflects untreated cardiac arrest before it is recognized by a bystander in the community or by a medical provider in the hospital
• The low-flow phase- begins with the onset of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cPR)
• The post-resuscitation phase - The post-resuscitation phase begins with the return of spontaneous circulation (RoSc).
option c: The chest compression to ventilation ratio should be 3o:2 or 15:2. Excessive ventilation results in decreased venous return into the chest, decreased coronary and cerebral blood flow,
diminished cardiac output, and ultimately a decreased likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation.
