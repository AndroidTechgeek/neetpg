Q1,The following groups of people must be screened for ca cervix:,"a)More than 65 years old
b)Less than 21 years old
c)21 to 65 year old females
d)Teenagers","screening for cervical cancer is done in females aged 21 to 65 years.
*Three consecutive negative cytologic tests or two consecutive negative co-tests within the past 1o years, with the most recent test occurring within the past 5 years

Age Group	screening Recommendations
<21 years	Do not screen
21-29 years	cytologic testing (pap smear) every 3 years




Age Group	Screening Recommendations
3o-65 years	preferred: cytologic and HpV co-testing every 5 yearsAlter  native: cytologic testing ever   y 3 years
>65 years	Discontinue screening if suffi  cient negative screening resul ts* present, and if there is no  history of HSIL, adenocarcin  oma in situ, or cancer.
women who have undergone total hysterectomy with rem  oval of cervix	Discontinue screening",,C,
Q2,oral contraceptives act by all of the following mechanisms except:,"a)Inhibit implantation
b)cervical mucus thickening
c)Inhibit ovulation
d)Increase GnRH release","oral contraceptive pills (ocps) do not cause an increase in GnRH, they inhibit the release of GnRH.
ocps act via the following mechanisms:
• Inhibiting ovulation - Both estrogen and progesterone act on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to inhibit the release of GnRH (and thus subsequently LH and FSH). Seen in combined oral pills.
• preventing implantation - under the effect of ocps, endometrial stroma undergoes hypoplasia,  with atrophy of glands. This makes it unfavorable for implantation of the embryo. Seen primarily with mifepristone, but is a secondary mechanism of action with progesterone-only pills as well.
• cervical mucus becomes thick and scanty under the effect of progesterone. This makes it difficult for sperm to enter. Seen in progesterone-only pills.",,D,
Q3,A 3o-year-old woman is diagnosed with a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) of the cervix and no obvious macroscopic growth. what is the next line of management?,"a)Hysterectomy
b)conization
c)colposcopy and biopsy
d)Follow-up after 6 months","In a woman diagnosed with a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), the next step in management is to perform a colposcopy and biopsy.
patients who are found to have HSIL are further subjected to biopsy. This is done by colposcopic study for the visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) for aceto-white areas and taking biopsies of  abnormal areas.",,C,5884-3702.PNG
Q4,"A patient with 6 weeks amenorrhea and a positive pregnancy test came with complaints of
lower abdominal pain, moderate bleeding Pv. She was hemodynamically stable. on USG,
there was no gestational sac in the uterus. ovaries were normal and no free fluid in the pouch



of Douglas. what is the next line of management?","a)Declare as complete abortion and follow-up in 15 days
b)Admit and observe
c)Diagnostic laparoscopy
d)Follow-up with beta-HCG","The patient presents with a history of 6 weeks of amenorrhea, a positive urine pregnancy
test, abdominal pain and moderate vaginal bleeding. However, the ultrasound examination does not reveal a gestational sac in the uterus, which could indicate either an ectopic pregnancy or an abortion. In such cases, the next line of management is to follow up with beta-HCG (human
chorionic gonadotropin) levels.
Beta-HCG levels above 15oo mIU/mL are considered the discriminatory value, beyond which a gestational sac should be visible on transvaginal ultrasound.
If the gestational sac is not visible on ultrasound and the beta-HCG levels are above 15oo
mIU/mL, it suggests an ectopic pregnancy. on the other hand, if the beta-HCG levels are below 15oo mIU/mL, they can be repeated after 48 hours and interpreted as follows:
• Decreasing HCG levels between day 1 and day 3 suggest a possible abortion.
• If the HCG levels rise during this period but does not double, it indicates a likely ectopic pregnancy.
Note: while some institutions set the discriminatory threshold for HCG levels at ≥ 15oo mIU/mL, others use ≥ 2ooo mIU/mL.",,D,
Q5,"A hypertensive pregnant woman with abdominal pain, bleeding per vaginum, and loss of fetal movements. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)Abruptio placenta
b)placenta previa
c)Hydramnios
d)preterm labour","The given clinical picture with abdominal pain, bleeding per vaginum, and loss of fetal
movements in a hypertensive pregnant woman points to the diagnosis of placental abruption.   placenta previa (option B) refers to when the placenta is implanted partially or completely over the internal os and it usually presents with painless vaginal bleeding.



Hydramnios (option C) refers to a state where the volume of amniotic fluid exceeds 2ooomL and it does not present with bleeding per vaginum.
In preterm labor (option D) fetal movements are not compromised.
Abruptio placenta is the partial/total placental separation from its implantation site before delivery. The bleeding may be:
• Revealed (blood dissects downwards between membranes and uterine wall to escape through the cervix)
• Concealed (blood accumulates between the detached placenta and uterus)
Hypertension in pregnancy is the most important risk factor for abruptio placenta. Patients often present with sudden onset abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, uterine tenderness, and frequent
contractions.
The hemorrhage into decidua basalis causes separation and compression of the placenta. This leads to a compromise of circulation to the fetus, leading to fetal distress.
Clinical classification of placental abruption:

Grade 1	Grade 2	Grade 3
vaginal bleedingis slight	vaginal bleeding mild to mod erate	Bleeding is moderate to sever e or concealed.
uterus irritable, minimal ten derness	uterine tendernessis always present	uterine tenderness is marked.
Maternal BP and fibrinogen unaffected	Maternal pulse increased, BP maintained	shock is pronounced
FHs good	Fetal distress present	Fetal death is the rule
Maternal shock absent	Maternal shock absent	Associated coagulation defect or anuria may complicate",,A,
Q6,A 3o-year-old woman visits an infertility clinic. she has a regular 28-day cycle. How should she be evaluated?,"a)serum progesterone on day 14
b)serum progesterone on day 21
c)serum LH on day 14
d)serum LH on day 21","serum progesterone on day 21 should be evaluated in this woman to check for anovulatory cycles.
Anovulation is the major cause of female infertility. Therefore, tests are done to rule out anovulatory defects in a woman presenting with infertility.
After ovulation, the plasma concentration of progesterone increases and reaches its peak during the mid-luteal phase. serum progesterone levels are assessed on day 8 and day 21 of a 28-day
cycle. If the progesterone value increases from less than 1 ng/mL to greater than 6 ng/mL, it
indicates ovulation. subsequently, as the corpus luteum degenerates, progesterone levels decline.
If the plasma progesterone level remains low during the mid-luteal phase, it suggests a corpus luteal phase defect and indicates the need for hormonal therapy.
Daily estimation of serum LH (options C and D) around the midcycle can detect the LH surge. ovulation coincides about 1o to 12 hours after the LH peak.",,B,
Q7,A 5o-year-old woman presents with abnormal uterine bleeding for two months. what is the next line of management?,"a)LNG- IUCD
b)pop for 3 months
c)Hysterectomy
d)Endometrial sampling","The next line of management in a 5o-year-old woman with abnormal uterine
bleeding is endometrial sampling.
Indications for endometrial sampling:
• Any female &gt; 45 years with abnormal uterine bleeding
• A female of age &lt; 45 years having exposure to excessive estrogen such as in PCOD, severe obesity, tamoxifen treatment
• women with failed medical management and persistent bleeding
• Transvaginal ultrasound findings &gt;12 mm in premenopausal women and &gt; 4 mm in postmenopausal women.
Endometrial sampling may be done by either curettage or aspiration biopsy by pipelle or vibra aspirator.
Note: Transvaginal ultrasound is a better first-line investigation to assess AUB. Since TVS is not included in the options, endometrial sampling is the next best answer. Assessing the reason for  AUB and ruling out malignancy in the postmenopausal age group are the initial steps before
prescribing any treatment.",,D,
Q8,"A patient with 12 weeks amenorrhea presents with vaginal bleeding. on examination, the    cervical os is open and the uterus is of 14 weeks size. USG shows a snowstorm appearance. The next best step in the management is?","a)Medical management
b)Follow up with beta-hcG
c)Suction and evacuation
d)Hysterectomy","The clinical scenario of vaginal bleeding, an enlarged uterus exceeding the corresponding period of amenorrhea, and a snowstorm appearance on USG strongly indicates a diagnosis of a
hydatidiform mole. Suction and evacuation is the next best step in the management of this patient.
Hydatidiform mole is an abnormal condition of the placenta, characterized by partly degenerative and partly proliferative changes in the chorionic villi. It may be either partial or complete.
The patient presents with a characteristic history of abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding or spotting, and vomiting during the first trimester. Also, there may be a history of passing grape-like vesicles vaginally. On examination, the size of the uterus is larger for gestational age and the fetal heart
sounds are absent.
A USG scan shows a snowstorm appearance which is characteristic of a complete mole.





suction and evacuation is the treatment of choice. Hysterectomy (option D) is done only if there is uncontrolled hemorrhage or perforation during surgical evacuation or if the age of the patient is     above 35 years and has completed her family.
serum hcG levels (option B) are checked within 48 hours of evacuation and are used as a baseline for future comparisons. It is then checked every week till it normalizes, which usually takes
around 4 to 8 weeks. After the hcG values return to normal, a regular follow-up is done monthly for 6 months.",,C,5887-3703.PNG
Q9,A 45-year-old woman is found to have a fibroid of 14 weeks size. She has no specific symptoms. what is the next step in management?,"a)Hysterectomy
b)Myomectomy
c)observation
d)Medical management","In this 45-year-old woman (&gt;4o years) with an asymptomatic fibroid of 14-week size, the next best step in management would be observation.
Fibroids/leiomyomas are slow-growing benign tumours thus regardless of their size asymptomatic fibroids are managed conservatively with observation and annual checkups.
Indications for the treatment of fibroids are:
• Abnormal uterine bleeding
• A rapid increase in the growth of fibroid
• Infertility
• chronic pelvic pain/ bulk symptoms
other options:
option A: Hysterectomy is usually reserved as the definitive treatment of choice for women who have completed their family and do not wish to preserve their fertility.
option B: Myomectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing fibroids while preserving   the uterus. It is indicated in an infertile woman or a woman desirous of childbearing and wishing to retain the uterus.



option D: Medical therapy aims to control menorrhagia in cases of symptomatic fibroids, improve haemoglobin levels before surgery, and shrink the fibroids before procedures such as
myomectomy.",,C,
Q10,All of the following structures are cut in mediolateral episiotomy except?,"a)Transverse perineal muscles
b)obturator muscle
c)Bulbospongiosus
d)Transverse perineal branches of pudendal nerves","All the mentioned structures are cut in mediolateral episiotomy except for the obturator muscle.
Episiotomy refers to the surgically planned incision on the perineum and the posterior vaginal wall during the second stage of labor. The objective is to enlarge the vaginal introitus so as to   facilitate easy and safe delivery of the fetus and to minimize overstretching and rupture of the  perineal muscles and fascia, which might end up in complete tears.
In mediolateral episiotomy, the incision is made downwards and outwards from the midpoint of the fourchette either to the right or to the left. The other types of episiotomy include median,
lateral, and J shaped episiotomy.
structures cut in mediolateral episiotomy are:
• posterior vaginal wall
• superficial and deep transverse perineal muscles (option A)
• Bulbospongiosus and part of levator ani (option C)
• Fascia covering these muscles
• Transverse perineal branches of pudendal vessels and nerves (option D)
• subcutaneous tissue and skin
Differences between midline and mediolateral episiotomy include:

Midline Episiotomy	Mediolateral Episiotomy
surgical repair is easy	surgical repair is difficult
Blood loss is lesser	Blood loss is more
Healing is superior	Healing is not so good
Dyspareunia is rare	Dyspareunia is comparatively more
postoperative comfort is max imum	postoperative discomfort is more
Extension, if occurs, may inv olve the rectum	Relative safety from rectal in volvement from extension",,B,
Q11,Raise in ESR during pregnancy is due to?,"a)Albumin
b)platelet
c)Fibrinogen
d)Anti-thrombin antibody","Raised EsR in pregnancy is due to an increase in fibrinogen and globulin levels.



pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state. The fibrinogen level is raised by 5o% during pregnancy. As
a result of rise in fibrinogen and globulin level and diminished blood viscosity,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (EsR) gives a much higher value (fourfold increase) during pregnancy.
Total plasma protein increases during pregnancy. However, due to hemodilution, plasma protein
concentration falls. This results in diminished viscosity of the blood and reduced colloid osmotic tension. Because of marked fall in albumin level and only slight rise of globulin (mainly
alpha-globulin), the normal albumin: globulin ratio of 1.7:1 is diminished to 1:1.",,C,
Q12,which of the following criteria is used for diagnosing abdominal pregnancy?,"a)spiegelberg's criteria
b)Rubin's criteria
c)studdiford's criteria
d)Godin's criteria","studdiford's criteria is used in the diagnosis of primary abdominal pregnancy. It includes:
• presence of normal tubes and ovaries with no evidence of recent or past injury/pregnancy.
• Absence of uteroperitoneal fistula.
• presence of a pregnancy related exclusively to the peritoneal surface and early enough to eliminate the possibility of secondary implantation after primary tubal nidation.
other options:
option A: spiegelberg’s criteria is used in the diagnosis of ovarian pregnancy:
• Tube on the affected side must be intact.
• The gestation sac must be in the position of the ovary.
• The gestation sac is connected to the uterus by the ovarian ligament.
• ovarian tissue must be found on its wall on histological examination.
option B: Rubin's criteria is used in the diagnosis of cervical pregnancy:
• soft, enlarged cervix equal to or larger than the fundus.
• uterine bleeding following amenorrhea, without cramping pain.
• products of conception are entirely confined within and firmly attached to endocervix.
• A closed internal cervical os and a partially opened external os.
option D:Godin's sonographic criteria is used for the diagnosis of a cesarean scar pregnancy:
• Empty uterine cavity
• Empty cervical canal
• A gestational sac in the anterior part of the uterine isthmus
• Absence of healthy myometrium between the bladder and gestational sac",,C,
Q13,which of the following is not a component of fetal biophysical profile?,"a)Fetal movement
b)Fetal breathing
c)NsT
d)contraction stress test","The contraction stress test is not a component of the biophysical profile.



Biophysical profile is a multi-parametric screening test to assess uteroplacental insufficiency. It consists of five components and the observations are made for 3o minutes.
Each parameter has a maximum score of 2 and a minimum score of o. So the total maximum score will be 1o. A score of 4 or less indicates fetal acidemia.
Interpretation and management of BPP scores:
The modified biophysical score has only 2 components i.e NST and amniotic fluid index (AFI).   It is considered abnormal (nonreassuring) when the NST is non-reactive and/or the AFI is &lt;5. Note: The contraction stress test (oxytocin challenge test) is an invasive method to assess fetal    well-being during pregnancy. when there is an alteration in FHR in response to uterine
contractions, it suggests fetal hypoxia.

Parameters	Minimal Normal criteria
Non-stress Test (NST)	≥2 accelerations within 2o-4

Q14,All of the following can be used for the treatment of PcOD except?,"a)clomiphine citrate
b)Letrozole
c)ulipristal
d)Laparoscopic ovarian drilling","ulipristal is not used for the treatment of polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD). It is a synthetic progesterone hormone receptor modulator used as an emergency contraceptive pill.
PCOD is a complex multisystemic endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age.
Rotterdam criteria is used to diagnose PCOD. The presence oftwo of the three components of this criteria establishes the diagnosis.
• Oligo/amenorrhoea, anovulation, infertility
• Hirsutism/acne
• ultrasound findings:
• Enlarged ovaries with ovarian volume will be more than 1o mL
• 12 or more small follicles each of 2-9 mm in size placed peripherally
Clomiphene (option A) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that is used as the first line of    treatment in managing infertility. Clomiphene with dexamethasone improves the fertility rate. In resistant cases, tamoxifen or letrozole (an aromatase inhibitor) (option B) can be tried.
surgical management of PCOD includes laparoscopic ovarian drilling (option D). Indications of surgery are:
• Failed medical therapy
• Hyperstimulation occurs
• Infertile women
• Previous pregnancy losses",,C,
Q15,which of the following is not a component of the Bishop score?,"a)cervical length
b)Type of maternal pelvis
c)cervical position
d)Dilatation of cervix","The type of maternal pelvis is not a component of the Bishop score.
The Bishop score is a scoring system used to assess labor induction outcomes. It is based on the  station of the head, dilation, effacement (or length), position, and consistency of the cervix noted by doing a vaginal examination.
Note: In the modified Bishop score (1991), the effacement is replaced by the cervical length in cm.",,B,
Q16,"A nursing assistant posted in the obstetric care unit was asked to monitor the progress of labour. After how much dilatation of the cervix, should she start the documentation?","a)2cm
b)5cm
c)4cm
d)6cm","The WHO Labour Care Guide begins the documentation of labour progression at 5 cm of cervical dilatation.
The WHO Labour Care Guide is a tool designed to help health personnel involved in labour care. It aims to
• Guide the monitoring and help in the documentation of the progress of labour.
• Guide the health professionals to offer supportive care throughout labour.



• Assist doctors in promptly identifying and addressing emerging labour complications.
• prevent the use of unnecessary interventions in labour.
• support audits and quality improvement.
The differences between the WHO-modified partograph and the latest WHO Labour care Guide are tabulated below:

Q17,Identify the grip shown in the image below:,"a)pawlik's grip
b)Lateral grip
c)pelvic grip
d)Fundal grip","The Leopold manoeuvre shown in the image is the lateral grip. It assesses fetal orientation.
Leopold's manoeuvres help assess the fetal pole, lie, presenting part, engagement, and attitude of the fetal head. They are as follows:
• Fundal grip (first Leopold):
• Assesses the uterine fundus.
• Helps in identification of fetal lie and determination of fetal pole at the fundus.
• The breech is felt as a large, irregular mass.
• The head feels hard and round and is more mobile.
• Lateral grip (second Leopold):
• Assesses the fetal orientation.
• The palms are placed on either side of the maternal abdomen, and gentle but deep pressure is exerted.
• The back is felt on one side as a hard, resistant structure.
• The fetal extremities are felt on the other side as numerous small, irregular, mobile parts are felt.
• Fetal orientation can be determined by noting whether the back is directed anteriorly, transversely, or posteriorly.
• The position of the anterior shoulder is mainly assessed by this grip.
• pawlik's grip / 1st pelvic grip (third Leopold):
• Assesses the presenting part.
• The thumb and fingers of one hand grasp the lower portion of the maternal abdomen just above the symphysis pubis.
• If the presenting part is not engaged, a movable mass will be felt, usually the head.
• Deep pelvic grip / 2nd pelvic grip (fourth Leopold):
• Assesses the engagement and attitude of the fetal head.
• The examiner faces the mother's feet, and the fingertips of both hands are positioned on either side of the presenting part.
• They exert inward pressure and then slide along the axis of the pelvic inlet.

Q18,Identify the fetal position in the given image.,"a)Right occipito-posterior
b)Left occipito-anterior
c)Left occipito-posterior
d)Right occipito-anterior","In the given vertex presentation, the fetal position is right occipitoanterior.
Fetal position refers to the relation of the denominator (arbitrary bony fixed point on the
presenting part), with respect to different quadrants ofthe maternal pelvis. In vertex presentation, the denominator is taken as the occiput (which is close to the triangular posterior fontanelle).
To determine the fetal position the following two steps are followed:
• Determine the direction in which the occiput is facing:
• Towards the pubic symphysis - occipito-anterior
• Towards the sacral promontory - occipito-posterior
• Midway between pubic symphysis and sacral promontory - occipito-transverse
• Determine if the occiput is facing the left or the right in relation to the materal pelvis",5880-3701.PNG,D,5895-3705.PNG
Q19,A midwife is examining a pregnant woman in labour when she noticed that the cord is prolapsed. what should be the next immediate step of management?,"a)Gently replace the cord inside the vagina
b)Inform the doctor and shift to OT
c)put her in Trendelenberg position
d)Do vaginal examination and find the fetal presentation","In this scenario the midwife should put the pregnant women in a Trendelenburg position or in an exaggerated and elevated sims’ position with a pillow or wedge under the hip or thigh.
caesarean section is the recommended treatment of choice for cord prolapse. prior to performing the procedure, several measures can be taken to alleviate cord compression. These measures
involve:
• Manually elevating the fetal presenting part using two fingers or the entire hand through the vagina
• positioning the patient in steep Trendelenburg, exaggerated sim's position, or knee-chest position
• Filling the bladder with 5oo–7oo cc or more of saline (known as the vagos method)
After the diagnosis of cord prolapse is made, it is crucial not to attempt cord replacement. such attempts are not only ineffective but also result in the inevitable rupture of the membranes,
leading to cord prolapse.",,C,5896-3706.PNG
Q20,"A 45-year-old patient comes with repeated infections of trichomonas vaginitis, her physician  advises for a pap smear. she asks you regarding the purpose of this test. what would be your appropriate response?","a)It is a screening test for cervical cancer
b)It is a diagnostic test for trichomonas infection
c)It helps to diagnose cancer in her genital tract
d)It helps to diagnose other associated genital infections in her","A pap smear is a screening test for cervical cancer. It is not a diagnostic test (option C). The   presence of abnormal cells/ a positive test requires further evaluation by colposcopy, cervical biopsy, or fractional curettage.
If trichomonas is reported from pap testing, it should be confirmed by saline microscopic preparation (option B).
Cervical cancer screening should start at age 21. women aged 21-29 should have a pap smear every 3 years, while women aged 3o-65 should have both HpV and pap co-test every 5
years. women should stop having cervical cancer screening after the age of 65 years. If suspicious pAp, screening till 75 years. HIV+ women should have annual checkups until three consecutive
negative tests followed by testing every 3 years for life.
pap testing should be done prior to vaginal examination. Lubricants should not be used and the patient should not be menstruating during the pap test. The patient should not have
intercourse 24hrs prior to the test. The ideal time is around ovulation.
procedure:
• The patient is put in a dorsal position, and the labia are parted
