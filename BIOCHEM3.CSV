Question 2,which of the following does not happen in 5' to 3' direction?,"a) Transcription
b) DNA replication
c) DNA repair
d) RNA editing","RNA editing occurs in 3’ to 5’ direction. It is the process by which the coding sequence is changed at the mRNA level before translation.
RNA editing occurs by insertion of additional Us at the 3’ end of the mRNA and proceeds in a 3’ to 5’ direction. The guide RNA (gRNA) acts as a template for the editing process. An example of RNA editing is apoB gene and mRNA shown in the image below:",,D,nan;730-599.PNG
Question 3,chimeric DNA is associated with:,"a) paternity test
b) Maternity test
c) personal identification
d) organ transplantation","chimeric DNA is associated with organ transplantation, especially bone-marrow transplantation.
In organ transplantation, chimeric DNA refers to the mixture of donor and recipient genetic material that occurs when donor cells begin functioning within the recipient's body. It is used for long-term monitoring of bone marrow transplant recipients. Detecting changes in the levels of donor-derived cells can provide early warning signs of graft failure, rejection, or relapse of underlying disease.
Note: The practical applications of recombinant DNA technology include:
• Gene mapping using techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
• Producing proteins such as:
• Interferons, tPA (tissue plasminogen activator)
• Insulin, growth hormone
• Hepatitis B vaccine
• Molecular analysis of disease, to detect gene variations and mutations.
• Restriction Fragment Length polymorphism (RFLP) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
• Microsatellite DNA polymorphisms
• Gene therapy and bone marrow transplantation",,D,
Question 4,A bodybuilder starts eating raw eggs for protein. He starts to develop fatigue on moderate exercise. The doctor prescribes a vitamin. which enzyme is deficient in him?,"a) Glucose 6 phosphate
b) pyruvate carboxylase
c) PEPCK
d) Glycogen Phosphorylase","The patient developed pyruvate carboxylase enzyme deficiency.
• Biotin serves as co-enzyme for the synthesis of several carboxylase enzymes such as:
• Acetyl-CoA carboxylase
• pyruvate carboxylase
• propionyl CoA carboxylase
• Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase
• Individuals who eat an excess of uncooked egg-white, develops biotin deficiency and as a result deficiency of the carboxylase enzymes. This is because, a protein called, avidin present in the egg-white bind to biotin in the diet, and makes biotin unavailable for intestinal absorption.",,B,
Question 5,which of the following shows functional assessment of B1 deficiency?,"a) RBC Transketolase
b) RBC Glutathione reductase
c) serum Thiamine levels
d) RBC Glutathione Peroxidase","Erythrocyte (RBC) transketolase test is the most widely used method for the functional assessment of thiamine deficiency.
Thiaminediphosphate is a co-enzyme for transketolase. Therefore, in thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, the RBC transketolase activity is reduced. when thiamine diphosphate is added in-vitro to erythrocyte lysate, activation of apo-transketolase is suggestive of B1 deficiency.",,A,
Question 6,which modification will lead to a change in the biological activity of the hormone given in the picture?,"a) Hydrolysis of disulphide bonds
b) Change in 5-6 in A chain
c) Change in 29-3o in B chain
d) Change in 14-16 in A chain","The hormone shown in the above image is insulin. Among the given options, changes in 29-3o amino acids in the B chain cause the generation of short and long-acting insulins depending on the modification.
structure:
The primary structure of insulin consists of 2 polypeptide chains: A-chain(21 Amino acids) and B-chain(3o amino acids).
It has two interchain disulfide bonds,
• Between 7th amino acid of A chain and 7th amino acid of B chain
• Between 2oth amino acid of A chain and 19th amino acid of B chain
one intrachain disulfide bond is present between the 6th amino acid of A-chain and 11th amino acid in A-chain.
Modification:
various short and long-acting insulin analogs have been developed by modifying these amino acid residues.
• Insulin lispro: proline at position 28 and lysine at position 29 in the B-chain are interchanged.
• Insulin Aspart: proline at position 28 in the B-chain is replaced by aspartic acid.
• Insulin glulisine: Asparagine at position 3 and lysine at position 29 in the B-chain are replaced by lysine and glutamic acid.
• Insulin glargine: Asparagine at position 21 in the A-chain is replaced by glycine and the B-chain contains two extra amino acids(two arginine residues) at positions 31 and 32.
• Insulin detemir: Threonine at position 3o of the B-chain is removed and a 14-carbon fatty acid chain is added to position 29 of the B-chain.",724-596.PNG,C,nan;732-600.PNG
Question 7,The graph shown below is the titration curve of a biochemical compound. which of the following statement is true?,"a) The maximum buffering capacity of the compound is represented by points A and B
b) The points A and B represent the range of maximum ionization of the amine and carboxyl group
c) The compound has three ionisable side chains
d) The compound has one ionisable group","The maximum buffering capacity of the compound is represented by points A and B, which corresponds to the pk1 and pk2 of the compound.
other options:
• The points A and B represent the pka of carboxyl and amino groups respectively.
• The amino acid has no ionizable side chains as the graph shows only two pkas.
• The amino acid has two ionizable groups: an amino group and a carboxyl group. The above graph resembles the titration curve of the amino acid glycine.
Titration curve of Glycine:
The titration is completed at a pH of 12, where the glycine predominantly exists in the form of H2N - CH2 - COO-.
pk1 and pk2 correspond to the point where the buffering capacity is maximum.
Characteristics of the titration curve:
• Buffering capacity is referred to as the ability of the aminoacid to resist the change in pH due to the addition of acid (H+) or base (OH- equivalents), by accepting or losing the protons respectively.
• An ionizable group refers to the group which can either lose or accept a proton and becomes negatively charged or positively charged ion respectively.
• During the titration, the buffering capacity of the compound reaches its maximum, at points where the pka of the ionizable groups is reached.
• Each of these pka are labeled as pk1, pk2, pk3, etc.
• The presence of two pkas indicates that the compound has two ionizable groups. Ex. Glycine.
• The presence of three or more pkas indicates the presence of side chains on the amino acid, with additional ionizable groups.
• Ex. histidine has three ionizable groups, an amino group, an imidazole group (on the side chain), and a carboxyl group. The pkas of these groups respectively correspond to the pk1, pk2, pk3 of the titration curve of histidine.",725-597.PNG,A,nan;733-601.PNG
Question 8,which of the following TCA cycle intermediate is a part of heme metabolism?,"a) Alpha ketoglutarate
b) Fumarate
c) succinyl CoA
d) Malate","succinyl Co-A, an essential part for heme biosynthesis, is an intermediate of the TCA cycle.
The synthesis of heme begins by condensation of succinyl Co-A and glycine to form α-amino-β-ketoadipate, which is then converted to δ-aminolevulinate. These steps are mediated by the enzyme ALA synthase in the mitochrondria.
various steps involved in the synthesis of heme is illustrated in the image given below:",,C,nan;734-602.PNG
Question 9,The catalytic efficiency of enzyme is best expressed by which of the following kinetic constants:,"a) kcat/km
b) km/kcat
c) km/ka
d) ka/km","The catalytic efficiency of an enzyme is expressed as kcat/km.
kcat is the rate constant, which is the limiting rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction at saturation. It is given by vmax divided by number of active sites of the enzyme. km is the Michaelis-Menten constant, which is defined as the substrate concentration at which the initial velocity(vi) is half the maximum velocity (vmax/2).
For some enzymes, when a substrate (S) binds to the active site of the enzyme (E), and forms an enzyme-substrate complex (ES), the product is instantaneously formed. For such enzymes, the reaction of E+S→ ES becomes the rate-limiting step. Its rate is determined on the rate of diffusion of the molecules in a solution. Hence, these enzymes are called diffusion-limited or catalytically perfect.
Examples of the catalytically perfect enzymes, where the catalytic efficiency reaches the diffusion limit of 108-109 M-1s-1:
• Triosephosphate isomerase
• carbonic anhydrase
• Acetylcholinesterase
• Adenosine deaminase",,A,
Question 10,Type of mutation seen in sickle cell anemia:,"a) Insertion
b) Deletion
c) Point mutation
d) Frameshift mutations","• Sickle cell anemia is caused by the mutation of a single base in the β-globin gene, where adenine is replaced with thymine in the sixth codon of the DNA sequence.
• This leads to change from GAG in the normal gene to GTG in the sickle cell gene, leading to a change in mRNA sequence from GAG to GUG.
• As a result, the mutant gene now codes for valine instead of glutamic acid.",,C,nan;735-603.PNG
Question 11,By which mechanism does gene repair occur when mediated by CRISPR-Cas9?,"a) Base excision
b) Non-homologous end joining
c) Homologous end joining
d) Mismatch repair","Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the major mechanism used by CRISPR-Cas9 for gene repair.
The CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) are clustered palindromic sequences found in many bacteria. It is a form of acquired immunity to infection by bacteriophages which complements the system of restriction endonucleases and methylases.
CRISPR uses RNA-based targeting to bring the Cas9 endonuclease to foreign (or any complementary) DNA. within bacteria this CRISPR-RNA-Cas9 complex then degrades and inactivates the targeted DNA.
The CRISPR system has been adapted for use in eukaryotic cells for gene deletion, gene editing and even modulation of gene transcription.",nan,B,nan;736-604.PNG
Question 12,which of the following is deficient in a patient with features as shown below:,"a) phenylalanine
b) Tryptophan
c) Glutamine
d) Arginine","The image provided is characteristic of casal's necklace, seen in pellagra, and indicates a deficiency of Tryptophan.
pellagra can occur due to:
• vitamin B3 (niacin)
• Niacin is derived from tryptophan and needs B2 and B6 for its synthesis.
• Hartnup's disease (tryptophan malabsorption)
• Malignant carcinoid syndrome (↑ tryptophan metabolism)
• Isoniazid (↓ vitamin B6)
In Hartnup's disease, defective membrane transport of tryptophan across pcT and enterocytes leads to malabsorption of tryptophan. This causes a deficiency of tryptophan.
As a result, the production of niacin from tryptophan is reduced and this manifests as pellagra with dermatitis, diarrhea and dementia (3D's) and glossitis. A characteristic skin rash called the casal’s necklace may also be seen.",726-598.PNG,B,
Question 13,The attachment of Eukaryotic mRNA to the ribosome is mediated through ________,"a) poly A tail
b) tRNA
c) Guanyl cap
d) shine-Dalgarno sequence","The attachment of mRNA to the ribosome is mediated through the guanyl cap at the 5' end. Eukaryotic mRNAs have 7-methylguanosine caps at the 5' end and poly-A tails at the 3' end. The 7-methylguanosine caps (Guanyl caps) are necessary for:
• processing of primary transcripts to mRNA.
• Mediating the attachment of mRNA to the ribosome for translation.
• protection of mRNA against nucleolytic attack by 5'exonucleases.
other options:
option A: AAUAAA is present at the 3’ end, which is the polyadenylation sequence (poly-A tail). They help stabilize the mRNA, facilitate its exit from the nucleus and aid in translation. After the mRNA enters the cytosol, the poly-A tail is gradually shortened.
option B: tRNA molecules serve as adapters for the translation of the information in the sequence of nucleotides of the mRNA into specific amino acids.
option D: shine-Dalgarno sequence initiates translation in prokaryotes.
Note: The guanyl cap and poly-A tail aid in attaching the mRNA to the ribosome for translation, however, it is initiated and mediated first through the Guanyl cap. The poly(A) tail stimulates recruitment of the 4os ribosomal subunit to the mRNA, after which the ribosomal subunit binds to the guanyl cap at 5'end of mRNA.",,C,
Question 14,which of the following would have no effect on the function of the protein product?,"a) Glutamine replaced by asparagine
b) Glutamine replaced by alanine
c) Glutamine replaced by glutamate
d) Glutamine replaced by arginine","when glutamine is replaced by asparagine, there is no change in the function of the protein product.
This is due to the concept of conservative or homologous replacement of amino acids. Asparagine and glutamine are both uncharged polar (hydrophilic) amino acids. Thus, when glutamine is replaced with asparagine there is no change in the polarity or the charge of the peptide/protein.",,A,
Question 15,which of the following is not true about of proteoglycans?,"a) carries negative charge
b) chondroitin sulfate is a proteoglylcan
c) Made of amino acids and sugars
d) Holds less water","proteoglycans can hold large amounts of water, and not less.
proteoglycans are made of a central protein core with o-linked glycosaminoglycan side-chains. They hold large quantities of water and occupy space.
They provide the ground substance of connective tissue.
chondroitin sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan that is bound to a protein to form chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. It is present in the extracellular matrix. Hyaluronic acid and heparin are examples of glycosaminoglycans.
All of the other statements regarding proteoglycans are true.",,D,
Question 16,which of the following has protective as well as lubricating property?,"a) collagen
b) Mucin
c) Albumin
d) Immunoglobulin","Among the given options, mucin has both a protective as well as a lubricating properties.",,B,
Question 17,"In urea cycle disorders, which of the following can be used to reduce the levels of ammonia?","a) Glutamate
b) phenylbutyrate
c) Isoleucine
d) L-carnitine","phenylbutyrate can be used to reduce ammonia levels in patients with urea cycle disorders.
phenylbutyrate diverts urea into an alternate pathway and reduces the amount of ammonia. Hence, acting as an ammonia scavenger. other drugs that can be used to achieve the same outcome (ammonia scavengers) include phenylacetate and benzoate.
Note: Arginine is used as first-line treatment as it provides ornithine; a positive regulator of the urea cycle. Arginine also activates NAG synthase which increases NAG; a positive regulator of the urea cycle",,B,
Question 18,Restriction endonuclease will act on which of the following:,"a) AAGAAG
b) GAGAGG
c) AAGCTT
d) TACGAG","Restriction endonucleases can act on AAGCTT.
Restriction endonucleases act and cleave at the site of a palindromic sequence. A palindromic sequence is a sequence that reads the same backward and forward. An example is listed below.
5' --AAGCTT-- 3'
3' --TTCGAA-- 5'",,C,
