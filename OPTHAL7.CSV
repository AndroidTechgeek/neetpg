Q1,which of the following layers is responsible for maintaining the hydration and transparency of the cornea?,"a)Descemet's membrane
b)Endothelial cells
c)stroma
d)corneal epithelium","The hydration level and transparency of the cornea is maintained mainly by the endothelial cells of the cornea.
The endothelium possesses Na+/k+ ATpase, which keeps the corneal stroma in a relatively
dehydrated state. This helps maintain corneal transparency. Endothelial cells decrease in number with age. If the cornea becomes overhydrated, it begins to scatter light and gradually begins to
lose its transparency
other factors contributing to the transparency of the cornea are as follows:



• Regular arrangement of corneal lamellae (Maurice theory)
• The peculiar refractive index of corneal lamellae (Goldmann theory)
• Avascularity of the cornea
• A balance between the intraocular pressure (IoP) and swelling pressure The different layers of the cornea are as follows:
• Epithelium
• Bowman’s membrane
• stroma (substantia propria)
• Dua’s layer (pre-Descemet’s layer)
• Descemet’s membrane
• Endothelium",,B,
Q2,what is the characteristic feature of a fungal ulcer?,"a)Reverse hypopyon
b)Dendritic ulcer on a fluorescien dye
c)Ring abscess
d)satellite lesion","satellite lesions are characteristic of fungal ulcer.
The signs of a fungal ulcer include:
• Irregular margins of the ulcer.
• Presence of satellite lesions surrounding the ulcer.
• An immune ring (wesseley) may be seen around the ulcer due to deposition of the immune complexes.
• slough is usually dry, with feathery borders surrounded by a yellow line of demarcation.
• Hypopyon may be present or absent. If present, it is thick, immobile due to the direct invasion of the fungal hyphae into the anterior chamber.",,D,
Q3,what is the term used to describe an extra row of eyelashes behind the grey line?,"a)Trichiasis
b)Distichiasis
c)Tylosis
d)Madarosis","The extra row of eyelashes behind the grey line is called distichiasis.
Distichiasis can occur due to congenital or acquired causes. These lashes may irritate the cornea. Management is by lid splitting with cryotherapy to the base of the hair follicles.
other options:
option A: Trichiasis is inward misdirection of cilia, with the normal position of the lid margin.
option C: Tylosis is the thickening of the tarsal plate.
option D: Madarosis is the loss of eyelashes or eyebrows.",,B,
Q4,"A middle-aged woman presented with bilateral proptosis, restriction of eye movements, and chemosis. Her thyroid profile showed she was euthyroid. what is the most probable cause?","a)orbital pseudotumor
b)Thyroid ophthalmopathy
c)orbital lymphoma
d)orbital cellulitis","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of thyroid ophthalmopathy.
Thyroid eye disease (TED) is the most common cause of both bilateral and unilateral proptosis in an adult in the euthyroid state. The main features of TED include lid retraction, proptosis,
periorbital edema, chemosis, and restrictive myopathy.
other options-
option A- orbital pseudotumor presents with painful eye movements periorbital edema, erythema, proptosis, ptosis, diplopia.
option C- orbital lymphoma usually presents in the 7th decade, most commonly observed as a painless palpable mass in the superolateral quadrant.
option D- orbital cellulitis is usually a unilateral condition with pain, proptosis, and chemosis. NoTE: Thyroid eye disease can also, though less commonly, occur in euthyroid patients.",,B,
Q5,which of the following drugs increases the uveoscleral outflow?,"a)Timolol
b)Latanoprost
c)pilocarpine
d)carbonic anhydrase inhibitor","Latanoprost is a prostaglandin drug, which acts by increasing the uveoscleral outflow and thereby lowers the intraocular pressure.
Mechanism of action: Latanoprost is a prodrug and gets activated during its passage through the cornea. It acts by stimulating the prostanoid receptors on the ciliary muscles. This leads to the
release of matrix metalloproteinases, which increases the uveoscleral outflow.",,B,
Q6,photostress test is used to differentiate between:,"a)Macula and optic nerve disease
b)cataract and glaucoma
c)Lens and cornea
d)Retina and vitreal pathologies","photostress test is used to differentiate between the disease involving the macula and optic nerve. This test is of particular use in early macular diseases such as central serous retinopathy.
In this test, one eye is covered and the patient is asked to read the smallest line on the near chart. A bright light is then shone into the eye for 15 seconds, and the patient is asked to read the line
again, and the time taken to recover is noted. The test is repeated with the other eye.
In normal people and in patients with optic nerve disease, the recovery time is not affected.
whereas, in patients with macular disease the recovery time is prolonged and is usually more than one-third of the normal recovery time. This is because, in macular disease, the photoreceptors are damaged, and there is a delay in the visual pigment regeneration process.",,A,
Q7,shifting fluid sign is seen in?,"a)Exudative RD
b)Traction RD
c)Rhegmatogenous RD
d)Retinal dialysis","The presence of shifting fluid is a hallmark feature of serous or exudative retinal detachment.



In serous retinal detachment, there is a subretinal accumulation of the serous fluid mostly due
to the breakdown in the blood-retinal barrier. when the position of the head is altered, the fluid   shifts to the dependent portion. serous retinal detachment has a smooth convex configuration. A retinal tear or preretinal traction is absent.
other options:
option B: Traction RD has a concave configuration and breaks are absent. Retinal mobility is severely reduced and shifting fluid is absent.
option c: Rhegmatogenous RD presents with tobacco dust in anterior vitreous with substantial vitreous blood or inflammatory cells. Retinal breaks are also seen.",,A,
Q8,"A 4o-year-old diabetic patient presented with the ■squint. on examination, the secondary   deviation was found to be more than the primary deviation. Forced duction test is negative. which of the following types of squint is most likely to be present in this patient?","a)comitant squint
b)Restrictive squint
c)paralytic squint
d)pseudosquint","The above clinical scenario is suggestive of paralytic squint. It is characterized by the presence of secondary deviation more than the primary deviation and a negative forced duction test.
The squint may be either comitant or incomitant.
• comitant squint: The angle of squint measured is same in all gazes.
• Incomitant squint: The angle of squint measured is different in different gazes.
The differences between comitant and incomitant squint are shown in the table below:
The incomitant squint is further divided into two main types: paralytic and restrictive.
paralytic squint occurs due to the paralysis of extraocular muscle while restrictive squint is due to the mechanical restriction caused by tight or fibrosed muscle.
Forced duction test(FDT) differentiates between these two types. In this test, the eye is moved mechanically with the help of a forceps.
• The test is negative if there is no resistance to the movement. It is seen in a paralytic squint.
• The test is positive if there is resistance to the movement. It is seen in a restrictive squint.

Features	comitantsquint	Incomitantsquint
Magnitude of squint	same in all gazes	varies with the gaze

Q9,A physician observed the following finding in a small child who came for an eye exam. This finding is associated with which of the following conditions?,"a)Myopia
b)Astigmatism
c)Hyperopia
d)Emmetropia","The given image shows convergent squint or esotropia, which is commonly seen in children with hyperopia, also known as hypermetropia.
Esotropia results due to increased accommodative effort in cases where there is under correction   of hypermetropia. The condition may be prevented by full hypermetropic correction. If the child is unable to wear the glasses due to flat nasal bridge or if the child is less than 2 years old, the
accommodation may be treated with drugs. Miotic drugs with anticholinesterase activity such as di-isopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) or echothiophate can be used in these children. Further
treatment may include orthotropic training or surgical correction of the squint.",3032-1847.PNG,C,
Q10,sympathetic ophthalmia is seen after ____________.,"a)penetrating trauma
b)Blunt trauma
c)chemical injury
d)urinary tract infection","sympathetic ophthalmia is seen after a penetrating trauma.
sympathetic ophthalmia is a bilateral granulomatous panuveitis seen after a penetrating trauma or less frequently, following intraocular surgery, usually multiple vitreoretinal procedures.
Patients present between 2 weeks and 3 months after initial injury.
The earliest symptom is blurred near vision in the sympathizing (uninjured) eye. The earliest sign is a retrolental flare in the sympathizing eye. Anterior uveitis develops in both eyes. The fundus
shows multifocal choroidal infiltrates in the mid-periphery. sub-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) infiltrates corresponding to Dalen–Fuchs nodules (image)(a granuloma situated between Bruch      membrane and the RPE) are also present.
steroids are the basis of treatment. High-dose oral prednisolone is given for several months.
Immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, and methotrexate can be used in
resistant cases or as steroid-sparing agents. Enucleation of a severely injured eye with no visual potential within 2 weeks of injury prevents the occurrence of sympathetic ophthalmia.",,A,3037-1848.PNG
Q11,A patient presented with unilateral proptosis and bilateral abducent palsy. what is the most probable cause ?,"a)Retinoblastoma
b)orbital pseudotumor
c)orbital cellulitis
d)cavernous sinus thrombosis","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of cavernous sinus thrombosis.
Features of cavernous sinus thrombosis include early involvement lateral rectus palsy (abducent nerve involvement) since it runs through the cavernous sinus. oculomotor and trochlear nerve    palsy occur later as they are related to the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. other signs are
proptosis, severe supraorbital pain, edema in the mastoid region, absence of corneal sensation, and dilated pupil.
options A- Retinoblastoma occurs in young children and presents with unilateral proptosis with leukocoria, buphthalmos, and squint.
option B- orbital pseudotumor presents with unilateral proptosis with diplopia, conjunctival chemosis. The inflammation is responsive to systemic corticosteroids.
option C- orbital cellulitis presents with unilateral proptosis with pain and decreased ocular motility.",,D,3038-1849.PNG
