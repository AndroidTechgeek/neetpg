Q4,"A 25-year-old woman complains of a creepy crawling sensation in her legs. It is more at night and prevents her from sleeping. she is relieved of these symptoms by either walking or
moving her legs. which of the following drugs is used in treating the condition?","a)Gabapentin
b)pramipexole
c)vitamin B12
d)Iron tablets","The history is suggestive of restless leg syndrome and gabapentin is the first-line choice of treatment for this condition.
Gabapentinoids are considered superior to dopamine agonists due to the high frequency of
intermediate and long-term augmentation with dopamine agonists, as well as their risk of impulse control disorders.
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is an irresistible urge to move the legs when at rest or while trying to fall asleep or an uncomfortable sensation of creeping-crawling feeling. It is worse at night and moving legs or walking reduces discomfort. uremia, neuropathies, as well as iron-deficiency and folic acid–deficiency anemias can produce secondary RLS.
In patients with restless legs syndrome, iron stores are initially repleted, and the aggravating  factors are eliminated. If RLS still persists, initial therapy with a gabapentinoid (pregabalin,    gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil) is preferred, rather than a dopamine agonist (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine).
FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of restless leg syndrome:
• Gabapentin
• Ropinirole
• pramipexole
• Rotigotine
Note: A dopamine agonist is used as an alternative in patients with increased risk for side effects    from gabapentinoids, such as those with obesity and its complications, a past or present history of moderate to severe depression, a disorder causing gait instability or respiratory failure, and a
history of substance use disorder.",,A,

Q6,what is the maximum period of voluntary self-admission under the Mental Healthcare Act 2o17?,"a)48 hours
b)7 days
c)3o days
d)9o days","The maximum period of voluntary self-admission is 3o days.
when a person has a mental illness that requires admission, and if he/she is able to make his or  her own decision and voluntarily requested admission, then it is called voluntary self-admission.
According to the Mental Healthcare Act, the maximum duration for which such admission can last is 3o days.

discharge, then such patients should be examined by two psychiatrists and can be admitted for a maximum period of 9o days.

Q7,Identify the stage of sleep based on EEG finding highlighted in red.,"a)stage 1
b)stage 2
c)stage 3
d)REM sleep","The marked area in the given EEG shows sawtooth waves that are characteristic of REM sleep.
sleep is comprised of two distinct physiological states, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and REM sleep. stages I to IV make up the NREM sleep with marked lower physiological
functions than during wakefulness. Dreams which occur during this state are usually lucid and purposeful.
REM sleep is characterized by a high level of brain activity. The physiological activity is similar to that during wakefulness. In REM sleep,
• pulse, respiration, and blood pressure are increased.
• Brain oxygen use increases during REM sleep.
• Thermoregulation is altered - poikilothermia prevails during REM sleep.
• There is loss of muscle tone - body movements are absent during REM sleep.
• There is partial or full penile erection - This is used to evaluate the cause for impotence.
• Dreams are abstract and surreal.



In normal adults, a REM episode has a latency of about 9o minutes during which the sleep is in the NREM stage. This latency is shortened in narcolepsy and depressive disorders.",3807-2424.PNG,D,
