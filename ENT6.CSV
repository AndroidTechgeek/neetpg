Q1,which of the following is not a feature of tubercular otitis media?,"a)Ear ache
b)Multiple perforations
c)pale granulation
d)Foul smelling ear discharge","Earache is not a feature of tubercular otitis media. It is a painless condition.
Tuberculosis of the ear is usually secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis. It occasionally spreads   hematogenously, from a tubercular focus in the lungs, tonsils, and cervical or mesenteric lymph nodes
It presents as a painless condition with foul-smelling discharge from the ear, that does not
respond to standard antibiotic treatment. patients have severe hearing loss that is out of
proportion to symptoms. Although predominantly conductive, sensorineural hearing loss may also occur if the labyrinth is involved.
A thickened tympanic membrane with multiple perforations in pars tensa of the tympanic membrane and pale granulations in the middle ear cleft is seen.
The image below shows the tympanic membrane in tuberculous otitis media:





Histopathology shows submucosal tubercles with Langhans giant cells and caseous
necrosis. smears and culture of ear discharge may be positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Evidence of primary pulmonary tuberculosis may also be seen on chest radiography.
Facial nerve palsy is a common complication. Mastoiditis, postauricular fistula, and osteomyelitis are also seen.
Treatment includes aural toilet, treatment of secondary bacterial infections, and a full course of antitubercular therapy followed by reconstructive surgery.",,A,3250-2010.PNG
Q2,which among the following statements is true about keratosis obturans?,"a)Failure of migration of desquamated epithelium along posterior meatal wall b) widening of meatus and facial nerve palsy might be seen
b)Associated bronchiectasis and sinusitis
c)All of the above","All of the above statements are true regarding keratosis obturans.
keratosis obturans occurs due to failure of migration of desquamated epithelial cells along the posterior meatal wall (option A).
It is usually seen between the ages of 5-2o years and is commonly unilateral. Clinical features include severe otalgia and difficulty in hearing. It is associated with systemic conditions
like bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis (option C).
on otoscopic examination, there is a thickening of the tympanic membrane and a keratin
plug appearing like a pearly white mass occluding the canal. The keratin that is shed from the    entire circumference of the deep ear canal appears to have an onion skin arrangement. There is also hyperemia of canal skin, sometimes with ulcerations and granulations.
sometimes, the extent of bone erosion is such that it leaves the facial nerve
exposed to injury and subsequent paralysis (option B). Extensive erosion of the bone can also result in automastoidectomy.
Treatment involves the removal of the plug by syringing or instrumentation. Any recurrence can be prevented with the use of keratolytic such as 2% salicylic acid.",,D,
Q3,what is the maneuver depicted in the image given below?,"a)Epley’s maneuvre
b)Trotter’s method
c)McGovern’s technique
d)valsalva maneuvre","The given image shows Trotter’s method in which the patient is made to sit, leaning a little
forward over a basin to spit any blood and breathe quietly from the mouth. It is the first step to control epistaxis.
other options:
option A: Epley’s maneuver is used in the treatment of BPPv (Benign Paroxysmal Positional vertigo).


option C: McGovern’s technique is used in choanal atresia. A feeding nipple with a large hole provides a good oral airway.


option D: valsalva maneuver is performed by forceful attempted exhalation against a closed nose and mouth. It is used as a test of cardiac function and autonomic nervous control of the heart, or  to clear the ears and sinuses.",3247-2008.PNG,B,3228-1986.PNG;3251-2011.PNG
Q4,pott’s puffy tumor is,"a)subperiosteal abscess of frontal bone
b)subperiosteal abscess of ethmoid bone
c)Mucocele of frontal bone
d)Mucocele of ethmoid bone","pott's puffy tumor is the subperiosteal abscess of frontal bone. It is a complication of frontal sinusitis.
An acute infection of the frontal sinus can cause osteomyelitis of the frontal bone. suppurative     material then breaches the frontal bone leading to subperiosteal abscess formation in the tissues of the forehead. pus may form externally under the periosteum as a soft boggy swelling with
a doughy consistency called pott’s puffy tumor. It may spread internally
causing subdural, epidural, and periorbital abscesses as well as secondary septic thrombosis of the dural sinuses. It is more often seen in adults as frontal sinus is not developed in infants and
children.
CT of the brain and paranasal sinuses is the most appropriate investigation. It can show the involvement of sinuses as well as intracranial or soft tissue spread of infection.
Treatment consists of large doses of antibiotics, abscess drainage, and trephining of the frontal sinus through its floor. sometimes, the removal of sequestra and necrotic bone may also be
required.

Q5,Identify the lesion of vocal cord in the image given below :,"a)Reinke’s edema
b)Malignancy
c)Tracheomalacia
d)Laryngeal papilloma","The image showing grape-like projections, involving the anterior part of the vocal cords depicts a laryngeal papilloma.
Laryngeal papilloma is a benign tumor of the larynx caused by the human papillomavirus (HpV type 6 and 11). They can occur in children, most commonly around 3 -5 years of age (juvenile      papillomatosis), as well as in adults. They involve the supraglottic and glottic regions of the



larynx. seeding of the lesions can occur during invasive laryngeal procedures, such as intubation. They have a high recurrence rate and very low potential for malignancy.
Adult-onset laryngeal papillomatosis is less common and usually seen in males aged 3o-5o years.  It is less aggressive and involves the anterior part of the vocal cords. The treatment is the same as juvenile papillomatosis.
patients present with hoarseness, aphonia, dyspnea, or stridor. Laryngoscopy shows pinkish to white grape-like projections that can be sessile or pedunculate with a visible central vascular
core. The diagnosis is confirmed by direct laryngoscopy and biopsy. Treatment consists of micro-laryngoscopy and Co2 laser excision.
The image below depicts laryngeal papillomatosis on laryngoscopy:


Reinke's edema (option A) is a collection of fluid in the subepithelial space of Reinke. It generally occurs in patients with vocal abuse or smoking. The vocal cords will show diffuse, symmetrical
swelling.

Q6,Inspiratory stridor is found in what kind of lesions:,"a)supraglottic
b)subglottic
c)Tracheal
d)Bronchus","Inspiratory stridor is seen in supraglottic lesions. It is often produced in obstructive lesions of supraglottis or pharynx, e.g. laryngomalacia or retropharyngeal abscess.
Expiratory stridor is produced in lesions of thoracic trachea, primary and secondary bronchi such as bronchial foreign body, and tracheal stenosis.
Biphasic stridor is seen in lesions of glottis, subglottis, and cervical trachea like laryngeal papillomas, vocal cord paralysis, and subglottic stenosis.
stridor is an audible respiratory noise that gets produced by turbulent airflow through an
obstructed upper airway. It is an inspiratory sound that may have an expiratory component. It is distinct from stertor which is a snoring-like noise produced from an obstructed nasopharynx or   oropharynx.
The intensity and pitch of sounds originating from the respiratory system vary based on their site  of origin within the respiratory tract and may be heard with or without a stethoscope. usually, the pitch of the sound increases, and the intensity decreases as one goes lower into the respiratory
tract.",,A,3255-2014.PNG
