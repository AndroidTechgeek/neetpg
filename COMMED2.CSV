c)The power of the study to detect the difference between operation A and B is 96%
d)The probability of a false positive conclusion that operation A is better than B is 4%","since the p-value of the study is found to be o.o4, we can infer that the probability of a false positive conclusion that the operation A is better than B is 4%.
In this scenario, the p value is o.o4 which makes it, by convention, statistically significant. we can reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis that operation A is better than
operation B.",,D,
Q11,A large number of tests were done in series. which of the following will be true?,"a)sensitivity and specificity will increase
b)sensitivity will decrease, specificity will increase
c)sensitivity and specificity will decrease
d)sensitivity will increase, specificity will decrease","when a large number of tests are done in series, net sensitivity is decreased and net specificity is increased.
Screening tests are done in series when the result of the first test determines whether to run the second test or not. e.g., HIV screening is done using consecutive ELISA.
Screening tests are done in parallel when the second test is independently performed regardless of what the first test result is. Both the tests are done at the same time. For e.g., In LFT, multiple
tests are done together like SGOT, SGPT, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, etc.
Following are the trends that are observed while evaluating screening tests:

	Tests in Serie s	Tests in parallel
combined sensitivi ty	Decreases	Increases
combined specificit y	Increases	Decreases
combined PPV	Increases	Decreases
combined NPV	Decreases	Increases",,B,

Q31,Droplet precaution and isolation is to be done for all of the following conditions except:,"a)pertussis
b)Diptheria
c)Localized varicella zoster
d)Mycoplasma pneumonia","Droplet precaution and isolation is not done for localized varicella zoster, as it is only transmitted through direct contact.
varicella-zoster localized in the patient with an intact immune system with a lesion that can be contained/covered do not require droplet precaution. Disseminated varicella in any patient
requires airborne and contact precautions.
Diphtheria, pertussis, and mycoplasma are transmitted by droplets and hence require droplet precaution and isolation.
Although patients are not contagious starting 48 hours after antibiotic therapy, droplet
precautions are typically maintained until the completion of the antibiotic course and are
culture-negative on two cultures taken 24 hours apart. Droplet precautions include the use of masks, gowns, gloves and protective eye gear when providing direct patient care.",,C,
Q32,"A patient presents with fever for 1 week, with abdominal distension, loss of appetite, and
