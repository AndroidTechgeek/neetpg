Q1,"A 65-year-old man presents with abdominal pain for the past 6 hours, BP- 89/5ommHg, RR- 24/min, saturation 92% with 6 L of oxygen. Radiograph shows extraluminal air in the
abdomen. which of the following must be done before shifting this patient into the OT?","a)Intubate the patient
b)Insert central venous catheter as initial IV access of choice
c)1 litre of crystalloid infusion
d)Confirm the diagnosis with CECT","volume resuscitation with 1 liter of crystalloid infusion should be done before shifting this patient to the OT for an emergency exploratory laparotomy.
The given clinical scenario in a patient with hypotension and tachypnea with extraluminal gas in    the abdomen is suggestive of perforation peritonitis with hemodynamic instability. The immediate step is volume resuscitation to maintain circulating volume and organ perfusion.
peritonitis is the inflammation of the peritoneum and can be categorized as local or diffuse and acute or chronic.
causes:
• Gastrointestinal perforation e.g. perforated ulcer, appendix, diverticulum
• Transmural translocation (no perforation), e.g. pancreatitis, ischaemic bowel, primary bacterial peritonitis
• Exogenous contamination, e.g. drains, open surgery, trauma, peritoneal dialysis
• Female genital tract infection, e.g. pelvic inflammatory disease
• Haematogenous spread (rare), e.g. septicaemia
• Miscellaneous- e.g. familial Mediterranean fever
clinical features:
• Abdominal pain, worse on movement, coughing and deep respiration
• constitutional symptoms: anorexia, malaise, fever, lassitude



• nausea +/– vomiting
• pyrexia (may be absent)
• Tachycardia
• Tenderness +/– guarding/rigidity/rebound of the abdominal wall
• pain/tenderness on rectal/vaginal examination (pelvic peritonitis)
• Absent or reduced bowel sounds
• Septic shock (systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS] and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome [MoDS]) in later stages
Management:
General care of the patient:
• Correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance
• Insertion of a nasogastric tube and urinary catheter
• Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy
• Aprropriate analgesia
Surgical treatment: Exploratory laparotomy and repair of perforation is the definitive
management. presence of peritoneal signs and hemodynamic instability are indications for urgent surgery.
other options
option A: Intubation is not indicated by the patient's current vital signs.
option B: Initial volume resuscitation can be done with the peripheral large-bore cannula. A central venous catheter may be needed if peripheral access is dificult, vasopressors are
administered, patient requires TpN.
option D: A CT scan, while helpful for locating lesion and confirming the diagnosis, is not indicated for a hemodynamically unstable patient.
Note:
According to recent ATLS guidelines, crystalloid infusion should be limited to a maximum of 1.5 litres as crystalloid resuscitation beyond 1.5 liters increases the risk of death.",,C,
Q2,"A patient with recurrent pain in the right hypochondrium, nausea, and vomiting is diagnosed with biliary dyskinesia. which of the following is least useful in the diagnosis of this
condition?","a)ERCP
b)HIDA scan
c)USG
d)Post surgery follow-up","USG is the least useful investigation in the diagnosis ofbiliary dyskinesia or sphincter of oddi    dysfunction since the findings can be normal or show non-specific changes such as dilatation of the common bile duct.
Sphincter of oddi dysfunction (SoD) is caused due to a structurally or physiologically abnormal sphincter with a higher tone, which fails to relax, causing pain and recurrent episodes of
pancreatitis with normal liver function tests. There are two clinical types: biliary SoD and pancreatic SoD. Each type is further classified into types 1,2 and 3.



other options:
option A: The best investigation for the diagnosis of SoD is ERCP with manometry of the biliary and pancreatic sphincters.
option B: HIDA scan will show a reduced gallbladder ejection fraction (EF). A gallbladder EF &lt;35% is considered diagnostic of biliary dyskinesia.
option D: Biliary-type SoD should be considered and excluded in post-cholecystectomy
syndrome; hence, post-surgery follow-up is essential.
CT and MRCP can demonstrate dilatation of the biliary and pancreatic ducts.",,C,
Q3,A 32-year-old woman was declared brain dead. Her family has decided to donate her organs. who is the ideal/best recipient?,"a)14 year old child with multi organ dysfunction syndrome
b)5o year alcoholic man with liver cirrhosis with 1 month abstinence
c)7o year old woman with end stage renal disease
d)32 year old woman with renal failure","Among the given options, a 32-year-old woman with renal failure is the most suitable recipient for transplantation.
This is because the prognosis for the other patients mentioned above is poor. Prioritization of organ transplant recepients should be done based on post-transplant outcomes.
option A - 14-year-old with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome is not suitable because there is a poor prognosis for the ongoing organ dysfunction.
option B - Alcoholic patients with just 1-month of abstinence are not considered for a transplant.
option C - A 7o-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease is not the right candidate because the chances of long-term survival and a successful outcome are very less.",,D,
Q4,ERCp is least useful in the diagnosis of_____________,"a)Recurrent pancreatitis
b)unexplained jaundice
c)periampullary mass
d)Acute pancreatitis without choledocholithiaisis","ERCP is least useful in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis without choledocholithiasis.
ERCP stands for Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography. It involves the use of a
side-viewing endoscope which is passed through the pylorus of the stomach into the second part of the duodenum to visualise the papilla. This is then cannulated, and dye is injected into the
pancreatic or bile duct to visualise the pancreatic or biliary tree. It can be therapeutic or
diagnostic. It is the best diagnostic modality for viewing the distal biliary tree, but MRCP is preferred as the diagnostic modality unless a therapeutic intervention is also needed.
Indications of ERCP:
• Choledocholithiasis
• Acute cholangitis
• Biliary stricture, biliary leak
• Pancreatic duct stricture, pancreatic stones
• Extrahepatic biliary strictures related to primary sclerosing cholangitis
• Endoscopic therapy for some patients with sphincter of oddi dysfunction



• Biliary or pancreatic ductal system tissue sampling
• Balloon dilatation of the duodenal papilla or ductal strictures
• sphincterotomy
The most common therapeutic indication for ERCP is the relief ofbiliary obstruction due to gallstone disease and benign or malignant biliary strictures.
Contraindications of ERCP include patients who cannot tolerate anesthesia, patients with type 3 sphincter of oddi dysfunction, luminal gastrointestinal obstruction (examination limited to an    area proximal to the level of obstruction and untreated hemostatic disorder (high risk of
bleeding).
Complications of ERCP include duodenal perforation, hemorrhage, pancreatitis and sepsis.
other options:
option A: ERCP can help in ruling out the etiology in cases of recurrent pancreatitis.
option B: ERCP can act as both diagnostic and therapeutic in cases of unexplained jaundice.
option C: ERCP can be useful in case of a periampullary mass to take a tissue biopsy and cytology.",,D,
Q5,which of the following is a correct statement regarding retroperitoneal trauma?,"a)All zone 1 injury to be treated conservatively
b)zone 3 injury whether blunt or penetrative should always be explored
c)zone 2 injury with expanding hematoma should be treated surgically
d)Mattox maneuver is when the ascending colon is mobilized to the right to visualise the aorta","A zone 2 retroperitoneal injury with expanding hematoma should be treated surgically.

zone of retroperitoneal injur y	Type of viscer a	Differential management
zone 1	Central	Always explored, after proxi mo-distal vascular control
zone 2	Lateral	only explored if the hemato   ma is pulsatile or expanding, else conservative/ angioembo lization
zone 3	Pelvic	only explored if the hemato   ma is pulsatile or expanding, else conservative/ angioembo lization






surgical exploration is done in cases of penetrating injuries to any zone.
other options:
option A: zone 1 injuries are always explored.
option B: Depending on the situation, zone 3 injuries can be managed with surgical exploration or conservatively.
option D: Mattox manoeuvre is left medial visceral rotation to expose the aorta, while the Cattell-Braasch manoeuvre is done by right medial visceral rotation to expose IVC.",,C,4750-2962.PNG
Q6,which of the following nerve is least injured during thyroid surgery?,"a)Recurrent laryngeal nerve
b)Ansa cervicalis
c)External laryngeal nerve
d)Marginal mandibular nerve","The marginal mandibular nerve is least likely to be injured during thyroid surgery as it is high up (mandibular margin) than the dissection plane of the approach to thyroid surgery.
other nerves that might be at risk of injury include:
• Recurrent laryngeal nerve may be injured if dissection is done below the cricoid cartilage or near the tracheoesophageal groove (option A).
• Ansa cervicalis may be injured if strap muscles are not cut high enough. (option B)
• External laryngeal nerve may be injured during ligation of superior thyroid vessels as it lies very close to the superior thyroid artery (option C).
Complications of thyroidectomy:
• Hemorrhage - most common complication overall; due to slipping of ligature
• Nerve injury
• External laryngeal nerve - hoarseness (more common)
• Recurrent laryngeal nerve - hoarseness if unilateral, life-threatening aspiration and aphonia if bilateral



• Respiratory obstruction
• Laryngeal edema - the most common cause of respiratory obstruction
• Bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy
• Laryngomalacia
• Tension hematoma
• Hypoparathyroidism - infarction of parathyroids
• Thyroid storm - inadequately prepared for surgery
• Hypothyroidism
• Recurrent thyrotoxicosis
• wound infection, stitch granuloma, keloid.",,D,
Q7,eFAST is least helpful in diagnosing which of the following conditions?,"a)pericardial Effusion
b)pneumothorax
c)Retroperitoneal hematoma
d)Renal injury","Among the given options, eFAST (focussed assessment with sonography in trauma) is the least
useful in diagnosing retroperitoneal hematoma as the sensitivity of ultrasound for the detection of retroperitoneal hematomas is extremely poor.
computed Tomography (cT Scan) is the investigation of choice for retroperitoneal injury, but it can only be done in a hemodynamically stable patient.
FAST stands for Focussed Assessment with Sonography for Trauma. It is a rapid, non-invasive bedside test for detecting free fluid using sonography used to assess patients for potential
thoracoabdominal injuries.
Technique:
• The patient is placed in a supine position and the following regions are scanned:
• Subxiphoid transverse view: assess for pericardial effusion and left lobe liver injuries
• Longitudinal view of the right upper quadrant: assess for right liver injuries, right kidney injury, and Morison pouch
• Longitudinal view of the left upper quadrant: assess for splenic injury and left kidney injury
• Transverse and longitudinal views of the suprapubic region: assess the bladder and pouch of Douglas
eFAST stands for extended FAST and incorporates left and right thoracic views to assess for pneumothorax and haemothorax.
Limitations of eFAST are:
• operator-dependent
• Bowel gas and subcutaneous air distort images.
• can miss diaphragm, bowel, and pancreatic injuries
• unreliable for assessment of the retroperitoneum



• cannot reliably exclude injury in penetrating trauma
• May need repeating or supplementing with other investigations",,C,4752-2963.PNG
Q8,"A 23-year-old man presented with burn injury. He is covered with burns on his head &amp; neck, both upper limbs, front and back of the chest. calculate the percentage of burns.","a)27%
b)36%
c)45%
d)18%","The percentage of burns calculated in the given patient is 45% according to wallace’s rule of nine. calculation:
• Burns on the head&amp;neck would account for 9% of burns.
• Burns on both upper limbs (9% for each limb) would add to 18%
• Burns on both sides of the chest would account for 18%
Therefore the total percentage of burns in the given patient is 9+18+18 = 45%",,C,
Q9,FAST stands for __________________,"a)First assessment with sonography in trauma
b)Focussed assessment with sonography in trauma
c)First abdominal sonography in trauma
d)Focussed abdominal sonography in trauma","FAsT stands for Focussed Assessment with sonography in Trauma.
It is a rapid, non-invasive bedside test for detecting free fluid using sonography to assess patients for potential thoracoabdominal injuries. It can be performed within 2-4 minutes.
Technique:
• The patient is placed in a supine position and the following regions are scanned:
• subxiphoid transverse view: assess for pericardial effusion and left lobe liver injuries
• Longitudinal view of the right upper quadrant: assess for right liver injuries, right kidney injury, and Morison pouch
• Longitudinal view of the left upper quadrant: assess for splenic injury and left kidney injury



• Transverse and longitudinal views of the suprapubic region: assess the bladder and pouch of Douglas

Q10,A patient with unilateral breast cancer is started on tamoxifen. This will increase the risk of?,"a)ovarian cancer
b)Endometrial cancer
c)Breast cancer on other side
d)cervical cancer","Tamoxifen increases the risk of endometrial cancer by 1-2%.
The benefit of tamoxifen in breast cancer outweighs the risk of endometrial cancer.
Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator, approved for the treatment of estrogen
receptor-positive (ER) breast cancer. It is used only in premenopausal women for 5 years in
low-risk patients and for 1o years in patients with a high risk of relapse (node-positive, tumor     &gt;5 cm, lymphovascular invasion). It is also known to reduce the incidence of second primary breast cancer in the contralateral breast.
Tamoxifen increases the risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women; hence aromatase inhibitors are used in postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen is also not recommended in patients
who have had bilateral mastectomies with ER-positive ductal carcinoma in situ. other side effects of tamoxifen include bone pain, hot flashes, nausea, vomiting, fluid retention and rarely



thrombosis and cataract.",,B,
Q11,which of the following is the most appropriate mesh for use in hernioplasty?,"a)Heavyweight with small pores
b)Heavyweight mesh with large pores
c)Lightweight mesh with small pores
d)Lightweight mesh with large pores","The most appropriate mesh used in hernioplasty is a lightweight mesh with large pores.
Lightweight meshes generally contain less material and induce a less-pronounced foreign body reaction and decreased inflammatory response, which results in better tissue incorporation,
increased prosthesis compliance, and decreased patient discomfort and pain.
Meshes with large pores exhibit less inflammatory infiltrate, connective tissue, and scar bridging, which allows increased soft tissue ingrowth. They have greater elasticity and flexibility and also     shrink less resulting in lesser adhesions, better tissue incorporation, and decreased patient
discomfort and pain. So the best mesh type among the given options is lightweight mesh with large pores.
Meshes used in hernioplasty can be synthetic or biological depending on their composition.
Synthetic meshes are made from polypropylene, polyester, or PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene). PTFE meshes are hydrophobic with a lower risk of adhesion.
Biological meshes are acellular matrix materials derived from humans or animals and have lesser complications. But due to poor collagen deposition and absorption, they rapidly lose mechanical   strength and hence their use is restricted to infected environments.
Note: To promote better tissue integration, a composite mesh was developed which combines the attributes of polypropylene and PTFE by layering the two substances on top of one another.

Q12,"A 3o-year-old teacher underwent parotidectomy following which she developed lower lip
paralysis. This probably occurred because of an injury to which of the following structures?","a)Temporal branch of facial nerve
b)Cervical branch of facial nerve
c)Buccal branch of the facial nerve
d)Mandibular branch of facial nerve","Lower lip paralysis occurs when there is an injury to the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve.
Branches of the facial nerve are:
• Temporal
• zygomatic
• Buccal



• Marginal mandibular
• Cervical
The facial nerve passes through the parotid gland, hence it might be injured during parotidectomy.
In contrast to this, the upper lip is supplied by buccal branches of the facial nerve.
Complications of parotidectomy include hematoma formation, infection, deformity (unsightly
scarring and retromandibular hollowing), temporary/permanent facial weakness, sialocele, facial numbness, permanent numbness of the earlobe due to great auricular nerve transection and
Frey's syndrome.",,D,4755-2965.PNG
Q13,which of the following is not an adverse effect seen after a massive blood transfusion?,"a)Hypocalcemia
b)Hypercalcemia
c)Hypokalemia
d)Hyperkalemia","Hypercalcemia is not an adverse effect of massive blood transfusion.
Massive blood transfusion instead leads to hypocalcemia as the anticoagulant citrate binds to
calcium. The lethal triad of massive blood transfusion is acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy.",,B,
Q14,which of the following gene mutations are involved in carcinoma of the colon?,"a)APC, BRCA, k-ras
b)APC, k-ras, p53
c)MYh, k-ras, APC
d)MYH, p53, DCC","APC, k-ras, and p53 gene mutations are implicated in carcinoma of the colon.
In the adenoma to carcinoma sequence, the loss of one normal copy of the tumor suppressor gene APC is the first hit, followed by the loss of the intact second copy of the APC gene (second hit).
other changes in the sequence include the mutation ofk-ras and the inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene p53, leading to the emergence of carcinoma. The accumulation of these
mutations is more important than their occurrence in a specific order. This is known as the Fearon-vogelstein adenoma-carcinoma multistep model of colorectal neoplasia.



A number of other genes on chromosome 18q are implicated in colorectal cancer, including SMAD2, SMAD4, and DCC.",,B,
Q15,which among the following is correct regarding adequate thyroid FNAC sampling?,"a)6 follicular clusters with 1o cells each
b)3 follicular clusters with 1o-15 cells each
c)1o follicular clusters with 6-8 cells each
d)12 follicular clusters with 1o-12 cells each","6 follicular clusters each with 1o cells are considered adequate thyroid FNAC sampling. There are different criteria for the adequacy of thyroid FNAC:
• Six groups with at least 1o cells in each group, or
• Ten groups with at least 2o cells in each group, are considered adequate.
Cystic goitre may not yield thyroid follicular cells, hence, the aspiration should be repeated under USG guidance.
FNAC is the investigation of choice in discrete thyroid swellings; it has excellent patient
compliance, simple and quick to perform in the outpatient department and is readily repeated. Bethesda criteria for reporting thyroid cytopathology:",,A,4756-2966.PNG;4758-2969.PNG
Q16,which of the following are used to stop esophageal variceal bleed?,"a)A, B, C and D
b)A and B only
c)A, B and C
d)A, B and D","All the given options can be used to stop esophageal variceal bleeding.
Image A shows the sengstaken-Blakemore tube. It has 3 lumens - one aspiration port and 2 inflation balloons. They are:
• Gastric aspiration port
• Gastric balloon port
• Esophageal balloon port
The gastric balloon is inflated and tension is applied to the gastroesophageal junction. If this does not control the haemorrhage, the esophageal balloon is inflated as well, compressing the venous    plexus between them. only gastric contents can be aspirated.




Image B shows the Minnesota tube. It has 4 openings - 2 inflation tubes and 2 suction tubes i.e. both gastric and oesophageal aspiration ports are present, which allows the aspiration of both     gastric and esophageal contents.
Images C and D both show an upper GI endoscope. They are used to identify the source of
bleeding and once identified, sclerotherapy and endoscopic variceal banding are performed, which have been shown to control hemorrhage effectively.
Banding has a lower rate of complications. If bleeding does not stop by banding/sclerotherapy, balloon tamponade should be tried.
The protocol for the management of esophageal varices is given below.",4734-2952.PNG,A,
Q17,"A 25-year-old male patient was brought to the ER after RTA, his RR is 25/min, BP is
8o/45mmHg. on examination, hyper-resonance is heard over the left side of the chest. The chest X-ray performed is given below. what would be the appropriate management in this  case?","a)wide bore needle insertion in the 5th intercostal space (ICS)
b)wide bore needle insertion in the 5th ICS followed by an intercostal drain in the 5th ICS
c)Aspiration of the pleural fluid
d)No intervention needed","The given clinical scenario of hemodynamic instability, hyper-resonance on the left side of the
chest, and the X-ray findings are suggestive of tension pneumothorax. It is managed by inserting a wide-bore needle in the 5th intercostal space (ICS) followed by placing an intercostal drain in the   5th ICS.
Traumatic pneumothorax can be:
• Simple pneumothorax: without hemodynamic instability
• Tension pneumothorax: with hemodynamic instability
The X-ray given below is showing a left-sided tension pneumothorax. A large, well-demarcated area is devoid of lung markings on the left side. The yellow arrows are pointing to the tracheal  deviation and the mediastinal shift to the right side.





Management:
• Simple pneumothorax: Tube thoracostomy or chest tube insertion in the 5th ICS in the triangle of safety
• Tension pneumothorax:
• Immediate management: Urgent needle decompression or needle thoracostomy i.e. insertion of a wide-bore needle in the 5th ICS, anterior to the midaxillary line
• Definitive management: Tube thoracostomy or chest tube insertion in the 5th ICS in the triangle of safety
Note: According to ATLS 1oth edition
• In adults, needle thoracostomy or needle decompression location is changed to 5th ICS anterior to the midaxillary line from 2nd ICS midclavicular line.
• In the pediatric age group, the needle thoracostomy location remains at the 2nd ICS midclavicular line.",4735-2953.PNG,B,
Q18,A patient presents with pain in the right upper quadrant on the second postoperative day   following a cholecystectomy. Evaluation reveals a collection in the subhepatic space. A bile leak was suspected. which of the following is the best investigation for this patient?,"a)MRCP
b)ERCP
c)HIDA
d)CECT","Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the best investigation in a patient suspected of post-cholecystectomy biliary leaks.
Patients with post-cholecystectomy biliary leak usually present with fever, jaundice and
abdominal pain.  USG is used for an initial evaluation in such cases and can show a collection in the sub-hepatic space.
The most common bile leak following cholecystectomy is from the cystic duct. This can be treated by placing a biliary endoprosthesis (stent) in the common bile duct across the origin of the cystic   duct.



MRCP shows fluid collections arising from bile leaks but cannot differentiate these from other causes of fluid collections.
ERCP is the best investigation as it has the advantage of being both diagnostic and
therapeutic.  ERCP is useful post-cholecystectomy as there is a high likelihood of a retained stone and stone extraction and/or temporary stenting may be required.
HIDA scan is the most sensitive investigation for biliary leakage.
CT scan can show focal fluid collections, ascites, biliary obstruction, hepatic atrophy, signs of secondary biliary cirrhosis and any vascular injury.",,B,4760-2970.PNG
Q19,what is the most likely diagnosis of the lesion shown in the image below?,"a)Arterial insufficiency
b)Neuropathic ulcer
c)venous ulcer
d)Tuberculous ulcer","The given image which shows a punched-out ulcer with regular margins on the plantar surface of the dry, crackled foot is suggestive of a neuropathic ulcer.
Neuropathic ulcers occur as a result of repeated trauma to the insensitive part due to peripheral neuropathy. There is a lack of sensation over the pressure points, leading to unnoticed
microtrauma, wounds or cuts which develop into an ulcer. Causes of neuropathic ulcers include
diabetic neuropathy, B12 deficiency, alcoholism, hypothyroidism, leprosy, peripheral nerve injury, transverse myelitis and myelomeningocele.
other options:
option D: Tuberculous ulcers occur when a cold abscess from bone and joint tuberculosis breaks out on the surface. The most characteristic feature of this ulcer is its edge which is thin and

Q21,"A 35-year-old chronic smoker presents with bluish discoloration of the toe along with
intermittent claudication. which of the following will be the next appropriate investigation in this patient?","a)CT angiography
b)MR angiography
c)Digital subtraction angiography
d)Duplex scan","Chronic smoker presenting with bluish discoloration of the toe along with intermittent
claudication is suggestive of peripheral arterial disease and duplex scanning will be the next appropriate investigation.
Duplex Scanning is a major non-invasive technique that uses B-mode ultrasound to provide an
image of the vessel. Most scanners now have color coding, which allows detailed visualization of   blood flow in a vessel. Different colors indicate changes in the direction and velocity of flow, with areas of high flow usually indicating stenotic lesions.
other options:
option A: CT Angiography (CTA) is more useful in the evaluation of visceral arterial disease (eg.    mesenteric ischemia). It can be beneficial in peripheral artery diseases where a duplex scan shows poor images (aortoiliac segment involvement). CTA is not routinely recommended in peripheral     artery disease because of concomitant renal dysfunction in these patients which can lead to
contrast-induced nephropathy.
option B: MR Angiography is time-consuming and expensive, hence not done as the next investigation. It is contraindicated in patients with claustrophobia and metallic implants.
option C: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is an invasive and expensive
procedure compared to other investigations. The benefits of DSA are that it provides dynamic
arterial flow information and can be combined with a definitive endovascular intervention when indicated. DSA is indicated only when there is a discrepancy in diagnosis or intervention is
planned. Complications associated with DSA include bleeding, hematoma, false aneurysm
formation, thrombosis, arterial dissection, distal embolisation, renal dysfunction, and allergic reaction.",,D,4764-2975.PNG
Q22,"A 4o-year-old woman presents with complaints of swelling of the right breast over the past 15 days. on examination, there was local rise of temperature, and the swelling was mobile over    the chest wall. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Inflammatory carcinoma
b)Giant fibroadenoma
c)phyllodes tumor
d)Galactocele","In the given scenario, the rapid onset of the disease and the examination findings are suggestive of inflammatory carcinoma of the breast.
Inflammatory breast cancer is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. It mimics acute
mastitis. The hallmark of inflammatory breast carcinoma is the diffuse tumor involvement of the dermal lymphatics within the breast and the overlying skin, often without a discrete underlying
tumor mass (peau d' orange appearance). The patient presents with rapidly progressive swelling of the breast, warmth, erythema and edema. A breast lump may or may not be present.
A diagnosis of inflammatory breast carcinoma should be suspected when a patient with rapidly
progressive swelling with inflammatory skin changes does not respond to antibiotics. The imaging features with ultrasound and a mammograph is non-specific due to the underlying erythema and   edema. A biopsy should be done to confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment includes combined-modality treatment:
• Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
• Mastectomy
• Radiation therapy
• Hormonal therapy- for ER-positive tumors
• Trastuzumab for HER-2-positive tumors
option B: Giant fibroadenomas occasionally occur during puberty. These are benign solid
encapsulated slow-growing tumors over 5 cm in diameter. It presents as a painless lump in the breast. They are managed by excision via a submammary incision.
option C: phyllodes tumors usually occur in women over the age of 4o years but can appear in younger women. phyllodes tumor is mostly benign even though it is also called cystosarcoma    phyllodes. It presents as a large tumor with an unevenly bosselated surface. They are usually



mobile over the chest wall despite their large size. This tumor does not infiltrate the skin. Nipple retraction is not seen in this condition. Benign lesions can be treated with enucleation or wide
local excision. Massive tumours, recurrent tumours and malignant lesions are treated with a mastectomy.
option D: Galactocele are the most common benign breast lesions in lactating women. It is a cystic enlargement of the mammary gland containing milk. They are mostly detected during  lactation or in the third trimester of pregnancy but rarely, may also present after stopping
breastfeeding. clinically, the mass is usually firm and non-tender and presents as a solid tumour-like lesion on physical examination. The patient usually notes the
lesion during lactation or some period after lactation. Needle aspiration, followed
by excision should it recur, is the standard method of treating galactocele.",4737-2955.PNG,A,
Q23,"A middle-aged man presents with progressive difficulty in swallowing for both solids and
liquids for 8 months. Barium swallow done is shown below. what other investigations need to be done in this patient?","a)upper GI endoscopy &amp; Manometry
b)upper GI endoscopy &amp; PET scan
c)upper GI endoscopy &amp; CECT
d)upper GI endoscopy and 24 hour PH monitoring","The given clinical scenario and the barium swallow showing a bird beak appearance are suggestive of achalasia cardia.
Achalasia is a primary esophageal motility disorder characterized by the absence
of esophageal peristalsis and impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) in response to swallowing.
Manometry is considered the most sensitive investigation to diagnose achalasia as it identifies
early disease before esophageal dilatation and food retention. The diagnostic criteria for achalasia with manometry are impaired lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation and absent
peristalsis with an elevated LES pressure.
Endoscopy is useful for ruling out pseudo-achalasia.

Q24,"A 55-year-old man with IHD presents with sudden, severe, generalized abdominal pain and multiple episodes of vomiting. on examination, the pulse rate is 118bpm, rhythm is
irregularly irregular, BP is 9o/6o mmHg. The abdomen appears soft, non-distended, and bowel sounds are absent. which of the following could be a likely diagnosis in this case?","a)Acute severe pancreatitis
b)Ruptured aortic aneurysm
c)Acute mesenteric ischemia
d)Peptic ulcer perforation","The given clinical scenario of a patient with sudden onset severe abdominal pain which is
out-of-proportion to the physical examination findings along with atrial fibrillation is suggestive of acute mesenteric ischemia.
Mesenteric ischemia may be acute or chronic. The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is most likely affected. An embolus is the most common cause of SMA occlusion. possible sources for SMA
emboisation include:
• Left atrium in atrial fibrillation
• previous history of ischemic heart disease/myocardial infarction
• vegetations on mitral and aortic valves associated with endocarditis
• An atheromatous plaque from an aortic aneurysm.
other causes of mesenteric ischemia include:



• Atherosclerosis of mesenteric vessels
• vasculitides
• venous thrombosis in factor v Leiden mutation
• Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia due to alterations in splanchnic blood flow.
The most important clue to an early diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia is the sudden onset of severe abdominal pain in a patient with atrial fibrillation or atherosclerosis. The pain is
typically in the central abdomen and out of proportion to the physical findings.
Associated clinical features include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distension, peritonitis, and the passage of bloody stools.
The gold standard for the diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia is angiography, and
management is laparotomy. The goal of operative exploration is to resect the compromised bowel and restore blood supply via embolectomy.
other options:
option B: A pulsatile abdominal mass is seen in the case of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Acute pain and hypotension occur with rupture of the aneurysm, which requires an emergency
operation.
options A and D: Acute severe pancreatitis and peptic ulcer perforation have no association with atrial fibrillation. They usually present with pain over the upper abdomen associated with
guarding and rigidity on examination.",,C,

b)chemodectoma
c)Neural tumor
d)Lipoma","A lateral neck mass in a pediatric patient, which is non-tender and present in association
with freckles, and hyperpigmented skin patches (cafe-au-lait spots) is suggestive of neural tumor i.e. neurofibroma.
Neurofibroma is a benign tumor arising from the connective tissue of the nerve containing
ectodermal, neural and mesodermal connective tissue components. It can be single or multiple. It is the most common intradural extramedullary spinal tumor. Neurofibromas can be local,
generalized (von Recklinghausen's disease) or plexiform types. patients present with mild pain or a painless swelling usually in the subcutaneous or cutaneous plane with tingling, numbness and   paraesthesia along the distribution of the nerve. complications of neurofibroma include cystic
degeneration, erosion into deeper planes, cord compression and paralysis (spinal neurofibroma) and sarcomatous changes.
Treatment is excision under general or regional anesthesia. Indications for surgery in
neurofibroma include symptomatic patients (pain and pressure symptoms), cosmetic problems and malignant transformation (5%).
option A: cystic hygroma is a type of congenital lymphangioma. This swelling is soft and partially compressible, which shows positive fluctuation and translucency test.
option B: chemodectoma or carotid body tumor is a rare tumor, most commonly present in the fifth decade and there is an association with pheochromocytoma. These patients usually present with a slowly enlarging, painless lump at the carotid bifurcation.

position, where the head end is lower and the feet are at a higher level.
The Trendelenburg and reverse Trendelenburg positions are used in surgeries that are required to move the abdominal viscera, such as the small bowel, away from the operative field. Restraints
and sideboards are placed to prevent the patient from sliding from the bed.
In laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the patient is placed in a reverse Trendelenburg position slightly rotated to the left. This exposes the fundus of the gallbladder which is retracted towards the
diaphragm.
other options:
option A: Lloyd Davies's position is a 3o-degree Trendelenburg position with the hips flexed at 15 degrees. It is used for rectal and anal canal surgeries like low anterior resection and
abdominoperineal resection. It can cause compartment syndrome of the calves.


option B: Jackknife position is a modified prone position where the patient's hips are supported    on a pillow and the table is flexed at a 9o-degree angle with the head and feet at a lower level. It is not used anymore due to the chest compression causing impaired ventilation leading to positional asphyxia. It was used for hemorrhoids and fissure surgery.

b)Type B
c)Type C
d)Type D","Injury to the right aberrant posterior sectoral duct associated with bile leak is classified
as Strasberg’s type C injury.
Biliary injury may occur post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The most common site of bile leak following cholecystectomy is the cystic duct.
MRCp is the gold standard for complete morphological evaluation of the biliary tree. MRCp with magnetic resonance angiography is more useful in cases of associated vascular injury. A HIDA
scan can confirm the presence of a bile leak or biliary obstruction.
The Strasberg classification of bile duct injury is widely used to anatomically define bile duct injuries.
Classification



• Type A: Bile leak from cystic duct stump or a minor biliary radical in the gallbladder fossa
• Type B: occluded right posterior sectoral duct.
• Type C: Bile leak from the divided right posterior sectoral duct.
• Type D: Bile leak from the main bile duct without major tissue loss.
• Type E: Injury to the main hepatic duct; classified according to the level of injury
• E1: Transected main bile duct with a stricture more than 2cm from the hilus.
• E2: Transected main bile duct with a stricture less than 2cm from the hilus

d)Neurofibroma","Liposarcoma is the most commonly seen tumor in retroperitoneal space.
Retroperitoneal tumors can be benign or malignant. Malignant retroperitoneal tumors may be
mesodermal (75%), neuroectodermal (24%), or embryonic remnant (1%) in origin. Rarely it can    be urologic or metastatic also. The order of frequency of primary retroperitoneal malignancy is as follows:
• Liposarcoma
• Leiomyosarcoma
• Rhabdomyosarcoma
• Fibrosarcoma
• Malignant nerve sheath tumors
Liposarcoma is composed of three histologic varieties (listed in order of decreasing frequency):
• well-differentiated and undifferentiated liposarcoma
• Pleomorphic liposarcoma
• Myxoid/round cell liposarcoma
Among the three subtypes, pleomorphic liposarcoma is the most malignant and often
metastasizes, while the well-differentiated is the least malignant. Myxoid liposarcoma has intermediate malignant behavior.
Diagnosis is confirmed by contrast-enhanced CT with CT of the chest to look for metastases.

Q35,which of the following is true about the Tillaux sign?,"a)Mass is felt in the periumbilical region
b)Mass is brilliantly transilluminant
c)Mass is mobile perpendicular to mesentery attachment line
d)Fluctuation is positive","Tillaux's sign is said to be positive if the mass/swelling is mobile perpendicular to the mesentery attachment line. Tillaux’s sign is seen in a mesenteric cyst.
Mesenteric cysts occur either in the small intestine (6o%) or the colon (4o%) and can be classified as the following:
• chylolymphatic (most common type)
• Enterogenous
• urogenital remnant
• Dermoid
• other causes: traumatic hematoma and cyst formation, tuberculous cold abscess of mesentery and hydatid cyst of the mesentery
They most commonly occur in adults with a mean age of 45 years. It is more common in females than males (2:1). The most common presentation is a painless abdominal swelling near the
umbilicus, which is smooth and not moving with respiration with Tillaux's triad:
• soft, smooth swelling in the umbilical region
• Freely mobile in a direction perpendicular to the mesentery (Tillaux's sign)
• zone of resonance around the cyst
other presentations include recurrent attacks of abdominal pain due to temporary impaction of a food bolus in a segment of the bowel narrowed by the cyst and vomiting.
complications of mesenteric cyst include torsion, rupture, infection and hemorrhage into the cyst.
ultrasonography and cT are used to demonstrate mesenteric cysts.



Treatment:
• Chlyolymphatic cyst is managed by enucleation.
• Enterogenous cyst is managed by removal of the cyst with resection of the adjacent bowel as it arises as a diverticulum or duplication from the adjacent bowel.

d)A-4, B-1, C-2, D-3","A-1, B-2, C-3, and D-4 is the correct option.
A: During breast surgery, removal of the axillary lymph nodes is commonly done. This carries a risk of injury to the long thoracic nerve, which originates from the C5-C7 roots of the brachial    plexus. It innervates the serratus anterior muscle. Injury to this nerve during surgery results in  paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle leading to winging of the scapula.
B: The external laryngeal nerve is a motor nerve that supplies the cricothyroid muscle. The close relationship of the external laryngeal nerve to the superior thyroid artery puts the nerve at
potential risk when the artery is clamped during thyroid surgeries.
C: Excision of the submandibular gland results in potential risk to 3 cranial nerves:
• Marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve

d)1, 2, 3 and 4","Patients with congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (CHPS) will present with non-bilious
projectile vomiting and visible peristalsis observed moving from left to right (not from right to left). Metabolic abnormalities include hypokalemia, hypochloremia and metabolic alkalosis.
CHPS occurs due to hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the pylorus, which results in
constriction and obstruction of the gastric outlet.
• Patients commonly present between 2 and 8 weeks of age.
• First-born male infants are at the highest risk.
• Infants usually present with projectile, non-bilious vomiting.
• Clinically, an olive-shaped mass is palpable in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium. when    the infant is given a test feed, visible peristalsis is usually observed moving from left to right (not from right to left), followed by projectile vomiting.
Metabolic abnormality:
• Infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis develop a characteristic metabolic abnormality i.e. hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria.
• Persistent vomiting results in loss of hydrochloric acid, leading to metabolic alkalosis (due to loss of H+) and hypochloremia (due to loss of Cl-).
• Kidneys try to compensate for alkalosis by secreting Na+ and HCo3-. However, sodium loss stimulates aldosterone secretion through the RAAS pathway.
• Aldosterone causes active reabsorption of sodium in exchange for K+ and H+ ions leading to the development of hypokalemia and paradoxical aciduria, since the body initially loses H+ ions due   to the loss of HCl, and instead of compensating for that loss, the body is losing more H+ ions
through urine.
Management:
• The child should be rehydrated and the metabolic abnormality must be corrected before surgery.

It is a bedside scoring system that may identify patients with suspected infection, who are at greater risk for sepsis outside the intensive care unit (ICU).
It uses three criteria, assigning one point each:
• Low blood pressure (SBP≤1oo mmHg)
• High respiratory rate (≥22 breaths per min)
• Altered mental status
The qSoFA suggests potentially life-threatening sepsis when at least two of the parameters are met.



Note :
The primary method to evaluate the risk of organ dysfunction (sepsis) in patients with suspected  infection is by determining the sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment (soFA) score; which includes an assessment of:
• circulation - systolic BP &amp; need for vasopressors; platelet count
• Respiration - Pao2/Fio2 &amp; need for mechanical ventilation
• Mentation - Glasgow coma score
• Hepatic function - Bilirubin
• Renal function - creatinine
organ dysfunction is identified by a soFA score of ≥ 2
The soFA score is limited by its requirement of multiple laboratory tests which makes it complex and time-consuming. In order to simplify the scoring process, the ""sepsis -3"" task force
recommended the quick sepsis-related organ dysfunction assessment ""qsoFA"" score.",,C,
