Q1,In which trimester does acute fatty liver manifest most commonly during pregnancy?,"a)First trimester
b)Second trimester
c)Third trimester
d)Both (a) and (b)","Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) occurs most commonly in the third trimester or early postpartum period.
Risk factors include Pre-eclampsia/HELLP syndrome, male fetus, previous history of AFLP, and multiple gestations.
AFLP (acute yellow atrophy or acute fatty metamorphosis) is the most common cause of acute liver failure in pregnancy. It usually occurs in the later stages of pregnancy, particularly in
the third trimester. It occurs due to fetal deficiency of long-chain acyl-coenzyme A
dehydrogenase (LcHAD) or poor placental mitochondrial function.
The patients present with persistent nausea and vomiting, progressive jaundice, and epigastric
pain. Features like acute hemolysis, hypoglycemia, hypertension, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, and edema can also be present. Symptoms may progress to fulminant hepatic failure with
encephalopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death.
Liver function tests such as AST, ALT, and serum bilirubin levels are raised. Hypofibrinogenemia, hypocholesterolemia, and prolonged clotting time can be seen. An elevated d-dimer is
seen. Microscopy reveals a characteristic microvesicular fatty infiltration.
The condition worsens till delivery after which the hepatic dysfunction resolves. A trial of labor by induction or delivery by cesarean is done. Intensive supportive measures including blood
transfusion should be provided.
The clinical and laboratory findings of acute liver diseases in pregnancy are as follows:
The condition worsens till delivery after which the hepatic dysfunction resolves. Appropriate
management is immediate termination of pregnancy irrespective of gestational age by induction or delivery by cesarean (for obstetric reasons) is done. Intensive supportive measures including  blood transfusion should be provided.

Q2,which of the following is true about vaginal changes in a normal pregnancy?,"a)Decreased number of Lactobacilli
b)Increased glycogen metabolism in the epithelium
c)pH &gt; 6.8
d)Epithelial thinning","There is an increase in the metabolism of glycogen in the vaginal epithelium during normal pregnancy.
The changes in the vagina during pregnancy include:
• Increased vascularity and hyperemia resulting in a violet/purplish color characteristic of Chadwick's sign
• vaginal epithelium undergoes marked proliferation (option D) with the extension of the squamocolumnar junction downwards
• vaginal pH decreases and becomes more acidic (option C) and varies from 3.5-6.o.
• Increase in the number of Lactobacillus acidophilus (option A). It metabolizes the glycogen stores and causes an increased production of lactic acid. Therefore, the pH becomes acidic.
• Increased volume of cervical secretion during pregnancy results in the production of thick white vaginal discharge.",,B,
Q3,You discover that there is evidence of cardiac malformation in a fetus during a routine USG   scan at 16 weeks. what is the minimum level of fasting blood sugar at which you can suspect overt diabetes?,"a)106 mg/dL
b)126 mg/dL
c)116 mg/dL
d)130 mg/dL","overt diabetes is when fasting blood sugar is ≥ 126 mg/dl. overt diabetics are women who are known to have diabetes before pregnancy.
A patient is said to have overt diabetes if:
• Fasting blood sugar ≥ 126 mg/dL
• A random blood sugar of ≥ 2oo mg/dL
• HbA1c of ≥ 6.5%
The maternal complication of diabetes:
• increased Miscarriage and preterm labor.
• increased incidence of preeclampsia
• polyhydramnios
• prolongation of labor due to shoulder dystocia, operative interference, and cephalo-pelvic disproportion.
Fetal and Neonatal complications of diabetes:
• fetal macrosomia (birth weight &gt; 4kg)

Q4,"A 45-year-old woman presented with a lower abdominal mass and lower abdominal
discomfort. on examination, the uterus appears uniformly enlarged and adnexa is free. MRI shows the presence of a myometrial cyst. what is the most probable diagnosis?","a)Endometriosis
b)Adenomyosis
c)Leiomyoma
d)Endometrial hyperplasia","Multiparous women &gt;4oyrs, presenting with abdominal mass (free from adnexa) and myometrial cysts on MRI, point towards a diagnosis of adenomyosis.



Adenomyosis refers to the growth of the endometrium (both stromal and glandular components) directly into the myometrium. It is predominantly seen in multiparous women above the age
of 4o years. Patients generally present with menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and sometimes dyspareunia. on examination, there is a gross symmetrical enlargement of
the uterus corresponding to 12-14 weeks size. The uterus is soft and tender on bimanual examination.
Transvaginal ultrasonography (TvS) reveals a salt-and-pepper appearance of the myometrium and the presence of sub-endometrial striations producing the venetian blind appearance. MRI can
also be done for diagnosis. However, the only definitive mode of diagnosis is histopathological examination.
Since most women affected by the condition are past the childbearing age, total hysterectomy is the treatment of choice. Localized excision/Levonorgestrel containing IUCD can be tried in
younger women.


other options:
option A: Endometriosis refers to the presence of endometrial tissue outside the endometrial  lining (uterus). They usually present as dysmenorrhea and lower dull abdominal pain. vaginal examination reveals a tender fixed retroverted uterus. They can be managed medically (oral     contraceptives, aromatase inhibitors, etc)  and surgically (if failed medical management).
Abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is performed in advanced cases. option C: Leiomyoma (fibroid) is the commonest benign tumor arising from the uterus. They
present as abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility, and abdominal pain. on bimanual examination, the uterus is enlarged and the mass moves with the cervix. It can be managed medically
(mifepristone or newer progesterone) and surgically. A myomectomy is performed for large fibroids with significant symptoms.
option D: Endometrial hyperplasia can be simple, glandular, or atypical. They are seen in women with estrogen excess states like obesity, PCoD, or on tamoxifen therapy. They usually present as   abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB).",,B,5938-3727.PNG

Q6,which of the following is not a contraindication for the induction of labor?,"a)pelvic tumor
b)Herpes infection
c)Heart disease
d)History of lower transverse cesarean section in last three pregnancies",Heart disease is currently not considered a contraindication for the induction of labor. vaginal delivery is preferred in such patients.,,C,
Q7,The given image shows what grade of placenta previa?,"a)IV
b)III
c)II
d)I","The given image shows grade III placenta previa.
placenta previa refers to the placenta implanted (partially/completely) over the lower uterine segment (over or adjacent to the internal os). Grades of placenta previa are:
•  Type—I (Low-lying): The major part of the placenta is attached to the upper segment and only the
lower margin encroaches onto the lower segment but not up to the os.
• Type—II (Marginal): The placenta reaches the margin of the internal os but does not cover it.
• Type—III (Incomplete or partial central): The placenta covers the internal os partially (covers the
internal os when closed but does not entirely do so when fully dilated).
• Type—Iv (central or total): The placenta completely covers the internal os even after it is fully dilated.





They typically present with sudden onset, painless vaginal bleeding. on vulval inspection, bright red blood is seen oozing from the cervical opening. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) is used to
confirm the diagnosis and position of the placenta.
Management is dependent on the presentation of the patient. If there is a need for fetal maturity, expectant management (advocated by McAfee and Johnson) is carried out without increasing
undue maternal stress. Definitive management by an elective cesarean section.",5929-3724.PNG,B,5940-3728.PNG
Q8,All are normal physiological changes in pregnancy except:,"a)Left axis deviation

• Increased left ventricular mass",,D,
Q9,A pregnant woman with a fibroid uterus develops severe acute pain abdomen at 28 weeks of gestation. There is no history of fever and the WBC count is 8ooo cells/mL. The most likely   diagnosis is:,"a)Red degeneration of fibroid
b)preterm labour
c)Torsion of fibroid
d)None of the above","The given scenario of severe acute abdominal pain without fever/leucocytosis in a pregnant woman with a fibroid is suggestive of fibroid torsion.
The incidence of fibroid in pregnancy is about 1 in 1,ooo. Due to increased vascularity in
pregnancy, the fibroid increases in size and becomes softer. The torsion is seen in the subserous pedunculated fibroid where the venous return is blocked at its site of attachment in the uterus.   This leads to severe acute abdominal pain. Due to the complication being more local than
systemic, fever or leucocytosis are generally not seen.
A transvaginal ultrasonogram is immediately done to detect the position and size of the fibroid, which is followed by laparotomic myomectomy as a part of emergency surgical management.
other options:
option A: Red degeneration of fibroid is seen commonly in the second half of pregnancy or
puerperium. It is due to a hemorrhagic infarction of the tissue and typically presents as acute focal abdominal pain with fever and leucocytosis. Treatment is usually conservative with bed rest,
analgesics, and sedatives.
option B: preterm labor is where the labor starts before 37 completed weeks. It is characterized by true labor pain. The abdominal pain is slowly increasing in intensity and duration and is also
accompanied by show (expulsion of the cervical mucus plug). There are intervals between episodes of contractions where the patient doesn't complain of abdominal pain.",,C,
Q10,what is the first line of treatment of mastitis in a lactating mother?,"a)Dicloxacillin
b)cefazolin
c)ceftriaxone
d)Ampicillin","Dicloxacillin is the first line of treatment for mastitis in lactating mothers and should be taken for 1o-14 days.
Mastitis refers to the infection of the breast parenchymal tissue. The most common organism
causing breast infection is staphylococcus aureus. It is common in new mothers at the beginning of lactation who are inexperienced with breastfeeding or during weaning when nipple trauma
occurs due to the infant's growing teeth.
clinical features of mastitis include:
• Fever and malaise
• Localized pain and tenderness
• purulent nipple discharge
• Redness and swelling of the affected breast
• positive fluctuation test



A culture from nipple discharge or test-needle aspiration of the cellulitic area is done to confirm the organism and its antibiotic sensitivity. An ultrasonogram of the involved breast is done to
exclude abscess. They are treated with antibiotics and adequate breast support. choice of antibiotics in lactational mastitis:
• Dicloxacillin 5oo mg 4 times a day is to be started empirically.
• Erythromycin is given to women who are penicillin-sensitive.
• If the infection is caused by resistant, penicillinase-producing staphylococcus species then vancomycin, clindamycin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is given for at least 1o days.",,A,
Q11,Major contributor for amniotic fluid post 2o weeks is?,"a)Fetal urine
b)Fetal skin
c)Fetal lung fluid
d)Maternal plasma","Fetal urine is the major contributor to amniotic fluid post 2o weeks.
Amniotic fluid is present in the amniotic cavity which is the space between the epiblast (ectoderm) and trophoblast. The volume of the amniotic fluid increases with pregnancy and reaches a
maximum at term. It is contributed by:
• Early pregnancy - ultrafiltrate of maternal plasma (option D).
• second trimester - the extracellular fluid that diffuses through the fetal skin (option B) and thus reflects the composition of fetal plasma.
• After 2o weeks - keratinization of fetal skin prevents diffusion across the skin. Hence, fetal urine forms amniotic fluid.
Note: Fetal kidneys start producing urine at 12 weeks (8–11 weeks), and by 18 weeks, they produce
7 to 14 mL per day.",,A,
Q12,what will be the level of the anti-Mullerian hormone in low ovarian reserve?,"a)&lt;1
b)1-4
c)&gt;7
d)&gt;1o","In low ovarian reserve, the level of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) will be &lt;1 ng/ml.
AMH is a glycoprotein secreted by the granulosa cells of the primordial follicle of the ovary. It helps in oocyte maturation and mono-follicular development. AMH is also used in assessing    ovarian reserve.
In women, AMH is always absent during embryogenesis and is secreted by the granulosa cells
after puberty. It helps in follicular development and oocyte maturation. Estimation of serum AMH is used in the study of ovarian reserve in female infertility and secondary amenorrhoea.
In men, AMH starts to be secreted by the sertoli cells in the testes by the 7th week of intrauterine life. It continues until puberty. It inhibits the development of the Müllerian system. The absence   of AMH results in the development of hermaphroditism.

Q13,The maximum dose of PGF2 alpha in postpartum hemorrhage is ____.,"a)o.25 mg
b)2 mg
c)2o mg
d)2oo mg","The maximum dose of prostaglandin F2 alpha in postpartum hemorrhage is 2 mg.
Prostaglandins are paracrine/autocrine hormones and act locally at the site of production. Main sources for:
• PGF2α  - Decidua and promotes myometrial contractility
• PGE2 - fetal membranes (amnion) and induces labor and promotes cervical effacement and dilatation
• PGI2 - Myometrium
carboprost tromethamine (hemabate) is the 15-methyl derivative of prostaglandin F2 alpha. It is   approved for the treatment of uterine atony at a dose of o.25 mg IM. This dose can be repeated if necessary at 15- to 9o-minute intervals up to a maximum of eight doses (2 mg).
It is the best drug to control PPH. ls also used an abortifacient in the second trimester.
contraindications include asthmatic women and those with suspected amniotic fluid embolism, as they cause pulmonary airway and vascular constriction.",,B,
Q14,Gestational trophoblastic neoplasm does not include,"a)partial mole
b)choriocarcinoma
c)placental site trophoblastic tumor
d)Invasive mole","A partial mole is not a gestational trophoblastic neoplasm (GTN).
Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is the term used to describe a group of tumors due to
abnormal trophoblast proliferation. Malignant forms of GTD are termed gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN).

Q15,"A baby was born at 34 weeks of pregnancy, the appearance of the baby is given below. what is the mother suffering from ?","a)Gestational diabetes
b)Rubella
c)Hypothyroidism
d)Gestational hypertension","The image provided depicts a baby with macrosomia (large for gestational age), the most probable cause of which is gestational diabetes (GDM) in the mother.
GDM in a mother is defined as carbohydrate intolerance with onset/first recognition during the present pregnancy. Diabetes in Pregnancy Societies of India (DIPSI) criteria is used to diagnose GDM (Venous plasma &gt;14omg % after 2h of ingestion of 75g of glucose).
Maternal complications of GDM:
• During pregnancy - Recurrent spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, urinary tract infection, polyhydramnios, and increased incidence of preeclampsia
• During labor: Prolongation of labor (shoulder dystocia) and postpartum hemorrhage Neonatal complications -
• Electrolyte imbalances - hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia
• Respiratory system - respiratory distress syndrome and delayed lung maturity
• Hematological system - polycythemia and single umbilical artery
• Renal system - hydronephrosis (renal agenesis) and polycystic kidneys
• cardiovascular system - VSD, ASD, coarctation of the aorta, and TGA
• Gastrointestinal system - duodenal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), and necrotizing enterocolitis
• central Nervous system - anencephaly, microcephaly, neural tube defects, caudal regression syndrome, and sacral agenesis
other options:
option B: congenital rubella syndrome presents with the classical triad of deafness, cataract, and congenital heart disease (the most common being - patent ductus arteriosus). Eye findings also     include salt and pepper retinopathy as shown below.
option c: congenital hypothyroidism is the most common preventable cause of mental
retardation and presents as 6 P's - pot-bellied, pale, puffy-faced child with protruding umbilicus, protuberant tongue, and poor brain development
option D: Gestational hypertension primarily occurs due to the failure of the invasion of
extravillous trophoblasts into the spiral artery. It is defined as a rise in blood pressure &gt;14o/9o mmHg after 2o weeks of pregnancy (without proteinuria). It usually leads to intrauterine growth   restriction (IUGR) and fetal death.",5931-3725.PNG,A,
Q16,The hormone acting on post ovulatory endometrium is :,"a)Luteinizing hormone
b)Follicular stimulating hormone
c)progesterone
d)oestrogen","The hormone acting on the post-ovulatory endometrium is progesterone.
Endometrium undergoes changes (endometrial cycle) during the menstrual cycle due to the action of various hormones. The basal zone (lower 1/3rd of the endometrium in contact with the
myometrium) is uninfluenced by hormones and shows no change during the cycle. The rest



(functional zone) shows the following changes:
• Regenerative phase (first 2 to 3 days)- the regeneration of glands and the stromal cells from the basal zone. Endometrial thickness is about 2mm.
• proliferative phase (5 or 6th day to 14th day) - estrogen (option D) causes the glands to become more tubular and perpendicular to the surface and increases the thickness to 1o-12mm on the
14th day (at the time of ovulation)
• Secretory phase(15th day till menstrual bleeding) - post ovulation, estrogen-primed
endometrium is acted by progesterone (from corpus lutetium) and causes increased blood flow  (spiraling of arteries) and increases tortuosity of glands (saw-toothed/cork-screwed glands). The thickness of the endometrium is maximum (12mm) in this phase.
• Menstruation (last 4 or 5 days) - estrogen and progesterone are withdrawn due to the regression of corpus luteum (lack of fertilization). This results in the shedding of the functional zone
(menstrual bleeding).


other options:
option A: The luteinizing hormone (LH) is secreted by the anterior pituitary and is crucial for ovulation to occur on the 14th day of the menstrual cycle.
option B: Follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) is secreted by the anterior pituitary. The ovarian follicle with the most sensitivity to FSH becomes the dominant follicle for the current cycle and    the rest undergo autolysis.",5932-3726.PNG,C,5945-3729.PNG
Q17,which of the following is an absolute contraindication to ocp use?,"a)chronic renal disease
b)Thromboembolism
c)History of amenorrhea
d)Diabetes mellitus","Thromboembolism is an absolute contraindication to ocp use.
oral contraceptives (ocp) are preparations of estrogen or progesterone or a combination of both. Estrogen in ocps suppresses gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and follicle-stimulating     hormone (FSH) whereas progesterone suppresses luteinizing hormone (LH), thereby inhibiting



ovulation.
Though ocps are generally used to prevent pregnancy, they are also indicated for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea, endometriosis, uterine fibroid, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB)
contraindications of ocps:
• Absolute contraindications (WHo category 4)-
• History of thromboembolism- DVT, stroke
• Heart diseases - Valular or ischemic
• severe hypertension
• Liver diseases like hepatic adenoma, and hepatic carcinoma
• Breastfeeding
• During pregnancy
• Estrogen dependant neoplasms like - breast cancer
• Relative contraindications -
•
WHo category-2 (benefits outweigh the risks) - cancer cervix, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cIN), and in patients with sickle cell anemia, disease of the gallbladder, or diabetes mellitus    (option D).
• WHo category-3(risks outweigh benefits) - patients with benign liver tumors, unexplained vaginal bleeding, or history of smoking &gt;2o cigarettes/day.
other options:
option A: Minipills (progestin-only pills) could be used safely in renal disease as they reduced clotting risks and is not an absolute contraindication.
option c: A history of amenorrhea is investigated based on the algorithm for primary or secondary amenorrhoea. ocps are used to regularise menstruation in polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcoD) which is a cause of secondary amenorrhoea.",,B,
Q18,what is the chromosome number of a partial hydatidiform mole?,"a)46 XX

Q19,A 55-year-old lady presents with third degree uterine prolapse. which of the following is the best management for her?,"a)Fothergill repair
b)sling operation
c)vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic floor repair
d)shirodkar procedure","In the clinal scenario of a 55-year-old woman with third-degree uterine prolapse, the ideal management is vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic floor repair.
uterine prolapse is the descent of the uterus from its normal position which usually occurs due to laxity of ligaments that offer support, seen often due to childbirth, aging, or trauma. The uterine   descent is clinically categorized into:
• First degree:  the external os remains above the vaginal introitus
• second degree: The external os protrudes below the vaginal introitus but the uterine body remains inside the vagina
• Third degree (syn: complete prolapse): The uterine, cervix, body, and fundus descend to lie outside the introitus
• procidentia involves prolapse of the uterus with the entire vagina everted.
The patient usually presents with a sense of heaviness in the pelvic region with lower back
discomfort. Based on the structures involved the patient can additionally have urinary symptoms (like incontinence and urgency), bowel disturbances (constipation and tenesmus), or sexual
discomfort during intercourse.
symptomatic uterine prolapse is managed surgically with different procedures based on the
profile of the patient. conservative management is done for old asymptomatic women with mild degree prolapse.
A vaginal hysterectomy is recommended for patients who satisfy the following criteria:
• &gt;4o years of age
• Have completed their families
• Do not wish to preserve menstrual and child-bearing function
other options:
option A: Fothergill repair or Manchester operation is a procedure done to preserve the
reproductive function and vaginal prolapse with supravaginal cervix elongation. It initially
involves preliminary curettage with low amputation of the cervix. After Mackenrodt's ligament is plicated,  anterior colporrhaphy and colpoperineorrhaphy are performed.
option B: sling operation (purandare's operation) is indicated in congenital or nulliparous
prolapse without cystocele. The procedure involves the extraperitoneal passage of rectus sheath strips joined to the anterior surface of the cervix by silk sutures.
option D: shirodkar procedure is a type of abdominal sling surgery done in young women to retain menstrual and reproductive function. It involves using a sling to fix the cervix to the     lumbosacral fascia.",,C,

Q21,what is the ideal time for nuchal translucency evaluation?,"a)6-8 weeks
b)11-14 weeks
c)14-16 weeks
d)16-2o weeks","Nuchal translucency evaluation, a component of first-trimester aneuploidy screening, is done between 11-14 weeks.
It represents the maximum thickness of the subcutaneous translucent area between the skin and soft tissue, overlying the fetal spine, at the back of the neck. when the nuchal translucency is
increased, the risk of fetal aneuploidy and structural anomalies such as heart defects is significantly elevated.
First trimester aneuploidy screening combines two maternal serum analytes and a sonographic measurement:
• Human chorionic gonadotropin (hcG)
• Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A)
• Nuchal translucency (NT)
It is performed between 11 and 14 weeks of gestation. In cases of fetal Down syndrome, the
first-trimester serum-free β-hcG level is higher and the PAPP-A level is lower. with trisomy 18 and trisomy 13, levels of both analytes are lower.
Note: Nuchal fold is a normal fold of skin seen at the back of the fetal neck during the second trimester of pregnancy. Increased nuchal fold thickness is associated with fetal aneuploidy.",,B,5949-3730.PNG
Q22,Magnesium sulphate has no role in:,"a)prevention of seizures in severe pre-eclampsia
b)prevention of recurrent seizures in eclampsia
c)prevention of RDs in premature baby
d)Reducing contractility of uterus","Magnesium sulfate has no role in the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome (RDs) in a premature baby, where there is a deficit of surfactant (which results in alveolar collapse).
Magnesium in the Mgso4 competes with calcium on voltage-gated calcium channels, thereby altering its uptake and release. Functions of Mgso4 include :
• Membrane protector and neuro stabilizer. It is used in the prevention of cerebral palsy in very low birth weight neonates.
• Reduction of motor endplate sensitivity to acetylcholine, and thus is used as an adjunct in the management of acute severe asthma in children and adults
• Blocking of neuronal calcium influx, and is thus used in the conservative management of pre-term labor (tocolytic, option D)
• Inducing cerebral vasodilatation, dilating the uterine arteries, increasing the production of
endothelial prostacyclin, and inhibiting platelet activation. Hence it is used in the management of pre-eclampsia (option A) and to prevent progression to eclampsia (option A).",,C,

Q24,A pregnant lady with a ■history of recurrent abortions is now diagnosed to have antiphospholipid syndrome. what would be the best mode of treatment for her?,"a)Aspirin only
b)Aspirin+heparin
c)Aspirin+heparin+steroids
d)Aspirin+steroids","The best mode of treatment for a pregnant woman with antiphospholipid syndrome(APS) is aspirin and heparin.
APS is a prothrombotic disorder (autoantibody-mediated thrombophilia) affecting both arterial and venous systems.
Patients present with recurrent pregnancy loss due to thrombosis of uteroplacental vessels, poor placental perfusion, and prevention of normal decidual changes after zygote implantation. They  may also present with preterm delivery, pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR),   and fetal death.
criteria for APS include:
• at least one otherwise unexplained fetal death at or beyond 1o weeks;
• at least one preterm birth before 34 weeks gestation because of eclampsia, severe preeclampsia, placental insufficiency; or
• at least three unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortions before 1o weeks.
Aspirin (6o-8omg daily) with heparin (5ooo-1o,ooo U subcutaneously every 12h) is the most effective therapy for APS. Treating APS with only aspirin (option A) is not recommended as    heparin is crucial in preventing thrombus formation at the decidual-thrombotic interface,

b)Antibiotics+Heparin
c)surgical embolectomy
d)Hysterectomy","Antibiotics plus heparin is the next course of treatment for septic pelvic thrombophlebitis.
Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis (SPT) refers to the pelvic infection with thrombosis of one/both ovarian veins. The pathogenesis of this disease is due to the spreading uterine infection



(secondary to trauma of delivery or surgery) combined with the hypercoagulable state of the pregnancy (thrombus formation).
The patients usually present with constant lower abdominal pain and occasionally with a palpable tender sausage-shaped mass (most diagnostic finding, but rare).
sPT is usually suspected when the fever fails to respond to antibiotic therapy. It can be confirmed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis.  Patients are treated with a combination of heparin and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Anticoagulation is done to prevent further thrombosis and reduce the spread of septic emboli.
Note: The use of anticoagulation is controversial as not all clinicians favor it. A small randomized study did not demonstrate a benefit, but the majority accept short-term anticoagulation as a part  of the treatment regimen.",,B,
Q26,what is the treatment of choice for a woman with atrophic vaginitis with complaints of itching?,"a)steroids
b)Topical estrogen
c)Antihistamines only
d)None of the above","Atrophic vaginitis is treated with topical estrogen vaginal cream.
Atrophic vaginitis (senile vaginitis) is seen in postmenopausal women due to the thinning of
vaginal mucosa (lack of estrogen). They present as discomfort (itching) and dryness in the vulva with dyspareunia. occasionally, they may also complain of yellowish or blood-stained vaginal
discharge.
The possibility of a coexisting carcinoma of the body or the cervix has to be excluded before
treating it with estrogen supplements. Though topical application is the initial treatment, systemic estrogens (hormone replacement therapy) can be considered based on the patient's profile and the severity of the symptoms.
other options:
option A: steroids are not indicated in the management of atrophic vaginitis as the inflammation is due to a lack of estrogen. Furthermore, they may predispose the patient to vaginal infections.
option C: Antihistamines antagonize histamine receptors and prevent the allergic response. since atrophic vaginitis is not an allergy response, they are not indicated in the treatment.",,B,
