Q2,A researcher discovered a new drug which is effective in chronic hypertensives with a p value of &lt;o.1o. which of the following is true regarding the same,"a)Not more than 1o% of the people benefitted by the drug could be due to chance
b)9o% of patients will be benefitted by giving the drug
c)The test is 9o% reproducible
d)9o% of test results could have occurred by chance","P value &lt;o.1o indicates that not more than 1o% of people benefitted by the drug could be due to chance.
It can also be interpreted as
• If the test is repeated 1oo times, the difference will be statistically non significant only 1o times and difference will be statistically significant 9o times.
• Probability of false positive conclusion that drug is beneficial which in reality is not, is 1o%.
It arises in case of statistical studies to accept or reject a null hypothesis.
P value is compared with a predetermined value α; P value &lt; α means the test is statistically significant and null hypothesis is rejected.",,A,

Q5,"A randomized trial comparing the efficacy of two drugs showed a difference between the two with a p value of &lt;o.oo5. In reality, both drugs do not differ at all. This is an example of:","a)Alpha error
b)Beta error
c)1 – α
d)1 – β","• In this scenario, let’s take the null hypothesis as the two drugs being the same, which the questions states, is true in reality.
• The alternative hypothesis will then be that both drugs are different.
• The questions states that p value was found to be &lt; o.oo5, which is statistically significant and so the null hypothesis is rejected.
• But we already know that the null hypothesis is true and we are forced to accept the alternative hypothesis even though it is false.
• This is a type I error or alpha error.
• when an alternative hypothesis is accepted even when it is false and the null hypothesis is true, it is a type I error or false positive error.",,A,
Q6,which of the following vaccine vials can be used based on the vaccine vial monitor (VVM) color changes shown?,"a)only vial 1 can be used
b)Vials 1 and 2 can be used
c)Vials 1, 2, and 3 can be used
d)All vials can be used","From the above image, only vials 1 and 2 can be used as the inner squares ofthe VVMs are lighter than the outer circles.
Vial 3 has crossed the discard point as the inner square and outer circle are the same color and     thus cannot be used. Vial 4 cannot be used as the VVM shows a darker inner square compared to the outer circle.",2367-1545.PNG,B,
Q7,"under the Mid-Day Meal (MDM) scheme, supplementary nutrition provided should cover at least _______","a)1/3 of the total protein requirement + ½ of total energy requirement
b)2/3 of the total protein requirement + ½ of total energy requirement
c)½ of the total protein requirement + 1/3 of total energy requirement
d)½ of the total protein requirement + 2/3 of total energy requirement","under the Mid-Day Meal (MDM) scheme, supplementary nutrition provided must cover at least ½ of the total protein requirement and 1/3 of total energy requirement to children in schools.
The MDM scheme is also called school Lunch programme and has been operational since 1961 in India. currently, it functions under the broad coverage of the Minimum Needs programme.
some other principles of the MDM are:
• The meal provided under the MDM should only be a supplement and not a substitute to home diets.
• The cost of the meals should be reasonably low.
• The meal should be easy to cook in schools.
• Locally available foods must be used, for as far as possible.
• The menu should be regularly changed to avoid monotony.",,C,
Q8,"In a subcentre area with a crude birth rate (CBR) of 2o, what would be the expected number of antenatal care (ANC) registrations by the village health nurse (VHN) in a year?","a)6o
b)8o
c)1oo
d)11o","• According to the Indian public Health standards (IpHs) laid down by the Government of India, a subcentre is to serve a population of 5ooo in plains.



• In this scenario, the CBR is 2o.
• probable number of pregnancies (y) = Birth rate x population of the area / 1ooo = 2o x 5ooo/1ooo = 1oo.
• But, we add a correction factor of 1o% to adjust for pregnancy wastage in the form of abortions or stillbirths.
• Thus, total number of expected pregnancies= y + 1o% of y= 11o
• As all the pregnancies are not registered, and at any given time an ANM should have atleast half the expected pregnancies registered with her, the number of ANC registrations is taken as 5o% of the expected pregnancies.
• Therefore, Total ANC registrations = total number of expected pregnancies/2 = 55
• Hence, the closest answer is 6o.",,A,

b)ordinal
c)Qualitative
d)Metric","The Child-pugh score is an ordinal scale of data as:
There is a rank order (Class A having a better prognosis than classes B and C) but no regular interval between each class. The final division of prognosis is based on class and not the
numerical values arrived at by the summation of a set of variables.
other options:
option A: The Child-pugh score cannot be a nominal scale of data as there is a rank order with class A having better survival statistics than B or C. Nominal data do not have a rank order.
option C: This is also not merely a qualitative scale as there are scores given to each variable to arrive at the final class.
option D: The data used in the Child-pugh score cannot be merely metric as the final division of prognosis is based on class and not the numerical values. Also, there is no definite interval

Q15,P-value is the probability of which of the following?,"a)Not rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true
b)Rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true
c)Not rejecting a null hypothesis when it is false
d)Rejecting a null hypothesis when it is false","p-value is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true.
The p-value is the criterion or significance level (α), below which an outcome can be said to be
statistically significant. From this, we can also deduce that the p-value is the probability that a null hypothesis will be rejected even when it is true, thereby making a type I error.",,B,
Q16,"while testing the deleterious health hazards on a group of people after giving a new drug and a placebo, the following results were obtained as tabulated. Based on these results, which of   the following is true?","a)Absolute risk reduction (ARR) is 1% and relative risk reduction (RRR) is o.1
b)Absolute risk reduction (ARR) is 1o% and relative risk reduction (RRR) is o.9
c)Absolute risk reduction (ARR) is 1% and relative risk reduction (RRR) is 1o
d)Absolute risk reduction (ARR) is 1o% and relative risk reduction (RRR) is 9","In the given scenario, absolute risk reduction (ARR) is 1% and relative risk reduction (RRR) is o.1. Let us reconstruct the design table in the following way:
Relative risk (RR) is given as a/(a+b) ÷ c/(c+d).
RR = 16o3/15225 ÷ 18o4/15225 = o.1o6/o.118 = o.89 ≈ o.9o.
Relative risk reduction (RRR) = 1 – Relative risk. In this scenario, RRR = 1 – o.9 = o.1 or 1o%. Incidence of a disease is the absolute risk of contracting it.
Absolute risk rate of the group using new drug = a/(a+b) = 16o3/15225 = o.1o6 or 1o.6% ≈ 11%.
Absolute risk rate of the group using placebo = c/(c+d) = 18o4/15225 = o.118 or 11.8% ≈ 12%.
Absolute risk reduction (ARR) is the difference in the absolute risk rates between the placebo and the drug. In this scenario, ARR = 12% - 11% = 1%.

Q17,A new drug combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma was prescribed by a radiotherapist. It prolongs the survival. which of the following is true in this  situation?,"a)Incidence increases and prevalence reduces
b)Incidence reduces and prevalence remains the same
c)Incidence remains the same and prevalence increases
d)Incidence reduces and prevalence increases","By the new drug combination, the survival of the patient has increased, hence incidence remains the same while prevalence increases.
Incidence: Number of new cases in a defined population in a specified period of time.
prevalence: Number of old and new cases at a given point of time over a period of time.
options A, B, D: The treatment only prolongs the disease, it has nothing to do with the occurrence of cases thereby nothing to do with incidence.",,C,
Q18,"Observe the following curves, which of the following is a true statement about sensitivity and specificity when the curve changes from green to pink?","a)Both sensitivity and specificity increase
b)Both sensitivity and specificity decrease
c)sensitivity increases while specificity decreases
d)sensitivity decreases while specificity increases","Both sensitivity and specificity are higher in the test represented in pink (Test B) compared to the test represented in green (Test A).
sensitivity is the proportion of all people with the disease who test positive. It is the probability of the test being positive when the disease is present.



sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) or sensitivity = 1     false-negative rate.
specificity is the proportion of all people without the disease who test negative. It is the
probability of the test being negative when the disease is absent.
specificity= TN / (TN + FP) or specificity= 1     false-positive rate.
Test B has an increased number of true positives and true negatives and decreased number of false positives and negatives, compared to Test A.
Hence leading to increased sensitivity and specificity.",2371-1547.PNG,A,
Q19,"A study was conducted to compare the incidence of postpartum depression in mothers as

b)sporadic, endemic, epidemic
c)Endemic, epidemic, sporadic
d)Endemic, sporadic, epidemic","Disease 1- the cases have been almost the same so it has to be endemic.
Disease 2- there is an alarming increase in the number of cases. It has to be an epidemic.
Disease 3- the number of cases has decreased without any explanation so it has to be sporadic. Epidemic refers to the occurrence of a disease in excess of expected frequency.
A pandemic is an epidemic affecting a large population over a large geographical area crossing international boundaries.
An endemic disease is a regularly occurring disease in a population in expected frequency without any importation from outside.
