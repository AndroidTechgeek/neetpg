Q1,which of the following is not seen in kawasaki disease?,"a)Purulent conjunctivitis
b)strawberry tongue
c)Rash
d)Cervical lymphadenopathy","purulent conjunctivitis is not seen in kawasaki's disease. Non-purulent conjunctivitis is a feature seen.
kawasaki disease is also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. It is a vasculitis
condition of unknown etiology.  Clinical features include a high spiking fever that is unresponsive to antipyretics. The fever can last between 5 days to 3-4 weeks. The five principal clinical criteria   for kawasaki's disease are:
• Bilateral non-purulent conjunctival infection with limbal sparing
• Erythema of the oral and pharyngeal mucosa, strawberry tongue (option B), and red, cracked lips
• Edema and erythema of the hands and feet
• various forms of rash- maculopapular, erythema multiforme, scarlatiniform (option C)
• Nonsuppurative cervical lymphadenopathy (option D)
The image below shows bilateral non-purulent conjunctival redness, strawberry tongue, and edema and erythema of the hands:





Diagnosis requires fever and at least four of the five principal criteria. Myocarditis develops
frequently in acute kawasaki disease. It presents as tachycardia and reduced ventricular systolic function. The tachycardia will be disproportionate to the fever. Patients may develop coronary    artery aneurysms in the 2nd to 3rd week of illness. They are generally asymptomatic and
diagnosed on echocardiography. However, if large it can lead to death. Thus, echocardiography should be performed at diagnosis and after 1-2 weeks.
Treatment involves 2g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulin as an infusion over 1o-12 hours within 1o days of onset. Moderate to high-dose aspirin should be administered until the patient is
afebrile.",,A,5717-3633.PNG
Q2,what is the ideal maintenance fluid of choice in children?,"a)5% dextrose and N/2 saline
b)5% dextrose and N saline
c)1o% dextrose and N/2 saline
d)5% dextrose and N/4 saline","5% dextrose and N saline is the ideal maintenance fluid in children.
5% dextrose provides 17 calories/1oo mL and nearly 2o% of the daily caloric needs. This level is     enough to prevent ketone production and helps minimise protein degradation. However, the child will lose weight on this regimen and therefore it is necessary to start enteral feeds sooner or if not possible, total parenteral nutrition is recommended.
other options:
Hypotonic fluids like N/2 or N/4 saline can increase the risk of hyponatraemia and free water movement inside RBCs, leading to haemolysis. Hence, isotonic fluids with 5% dextrose are     recommended as standard maintenance fluids in children.",,B,
Q3,which of the following is not seen in nutritional rickets?,"a)Low phosphorus
b)Normal calcium
c)urine calcium: creatinine ratio &gt; 15
d)High PTH","urine calcium: creatinine ratio &gt; 15 is not seen in a case of nutritional rickets. Instead low urine calcium and high urinary phosphate excretion are seen due to stimulation of PTH(parathormone)



in vitamin D deficiency(nutritional rickets).(option C)
Initially, low calcium levels in the blood stimulate increased PTH secretion from the parathyroid glands that results in bone resorption and increased reabsorption of calcium and increased
excretion of phosphorus in the kidneys.
Hence blood calcium levels can be low to normal with low phosphorus levels and high ALP due to increased bone resorption activity.
Note - High urinary calcium excretion is associated with hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria.
Nutritional rickets is a skeletal disorder primarily caused by a deficiency in vitamin D, calcium, or phosphorus, or a combination of these nutrients. Rickets typically affect children during periods    of rapid growth and bone development.
25-hydroxy vitamin D level should be measured to diagnose vitamin D deficiency rickets. The
initial lab tests in this child should also include serum calcium, phosphorous, alkaline
phosphatase (ALP), and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Lab findings reveal decreased calcium and phosphate levels, increased PTH, and ALP.
Treatment with oral vitamin D is preferred. Patients who show no response should be evaluated     for other disorders, such as hypophosphatemic rickets, vitamin D-dependent rickets, renal tubular acidosis-associated rickets, and chronic kidney disease-associated rickets.",,C,
Q4,which of the following is CORRECT regarding febrile seizure,"a)A,B,C
b)A,C,D
c)A,B,C,D
d)A,B,D","Chance of recurrence after one episode of febrile seizure is not 54%
Febrile seizures are seizures that-
• occur between the age of 6 months and 5 years
• occur at a temperature of 38°C (1oo.4°F) or higher
• Are not due to any CNS infection or any metabolic imbalance
• occur without a history of prior afebrile seizures
• occur with no post-ictal neurological deficit.
Types of febrile seizures:
Investigations:
• Lumbar puncture should be performed in the first episode of seizures with fever, for all infants &lt;6 months age (to exclude meningitis).
• EEG and neuroimaging are advised for children with atypical febrile seizures. Treatment:
Antipyretics and proper hydration. Midazolam or diazepam (rectal) can be used if seizures present.
Prophylaxis:



• Intermittent prophylaxis: If the febrile seizures are 3 or more in 6 months, or 4 or more seizures in 1 year, oral clobazam (1mg/kg/day) for 3 days during the fever episode.
• continuous prophylaxis: If intermittent prophylaxis fails or in recurrent atypical febrile seizures, sodium valproate and phenobarbitone can be used.

Q7,which of the following is not a suitable method for free flow oxygen delivery to a newborn baby?,"a)oxygen tube kept close to the baby's nose and mouth
b)oxygen mask placed firmly over the baby's mouth and nose
c)self-inflating bag attached to an oxygen mask placed over baby's mouth and nose
d)A reservoir bag attached to oxygen mask kept over the baby's nose and mouth","self-inflating bag is not used for free flow oxygen delivery. It is used to provide positive pressure ventilation. self-inflating bag and mask is used in neonatal resuscitation.
Bag and mask ventilation is used as the first step in airway management to provide positive    pressure ventilation. It serves as a rescue technique to provide oxygenation and ventilation in patients with difficult airways until tracheal intubation is achieved.
The bag in this apparatus is a self-inflating bag. This allows for it to be used without a pressurized gas supply and is delivered to the patient when the bag is squeezed (compressed). A patent airway and a good seal are essential to facilitate bag and mask ventilation.
The rescuer should be positioned at the patient’s head. A one-person technique involves the ""E-c seal"" in which your first and second digits form a ""c"" over the mask with your thumb pressing
down by the nasal bridge, your second digit over the bottom of the mask by the mouth, and your third through fifth digits forming an ""E"" and applying pressure to the mandible to hold the mask tight
Effective ventilation can be confirmed by:
• chest rise on squeezing the bag
• condensation in the clear mask
• pulse oximetry shows improved saturation
• capnography shows exhaled carbon dioxide
Mask ventilation is usually contraindicated in patients with an increased risk of regurgitation. It should be used with caution in patients with severe facial trauma.

Q8,All are true about renal tubular acidosis in children except,"a)Type 4 is due to defective ammoniagenesis and aldosterone resistance
b)Type 2 is Fanconi and hypophosphatemic rickets
c)Type 4 with paradoxical aciduria and hypokalemia
d)Type 2 - abnormal loss of HCO3","Hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis are features of type 4 renal tubular acidosis
Type IV (hyperkalemic) renal tubular acidosis: Hyperkalemia with distal RTA occurring due to
aldosterone resistance or deficiency is termed type 4 RT A. Aldosterone directly stimulates the
proton pump, increases Na+ absorption resulting in negative intrahibular potential and increases urinary K+ losses and stimulates basolateral Na+ /K+ ATpase. Hence, aldosterone deficiency or     resistance is expected to cause hyperkalemia and acidosis.
The clinical features seen in Type IV RTA are as follows:
• Hyperkalemia: Hypoaldosteronism results in an increase in potassium concentration.
• Metabolic acidosis: The important buffers in urine are ammonia and phosphate. Hyperkalemia impairs ammonia production in the proximal tubule, which reduces the buffering of hydrogen     ions. This results in decreased hydrogen ion excretion.
• urinary pH&lt;5.5: Due to the decreased production of ammonia in the proximal tubule, excess protons are excreted in the renal tubules, thus decreasing the urinary pH.
RTA type I (distal RTA) is seen in autoimmune diseases like sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, medullary sponge kidney disease, cirrhosis, drugs like
amphotericin B, lithium, etc. The patients develop hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis with alkaline urine (urinary pH &gt;5.5).
RTA type II (proximal RTA) is seen in Fanconi syndrome, wilson's disease, heavy metals
ingestion, etc., The patients develop hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis with acidic urine
(urinary pH &lt;5.5). It occurs due to generalized proximal tubule dysfunction. Defective HCO3- resorption is the primary dysfunctional mechanism causing metabolic acidosis and is also
associated with glycosuria, aminoaciduria, and phosphaturia. Rickets is rare in isolated proximal RTA but common in Fanconi syndrome.
RTA type III (mixed RTA) is seen in inherited mutations of carbonic anhydrase II. A combined   pathology of type I and type II RTA is seen in this type. It results in hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis.",,C,
Q9,"which of the following is a reliable sign of ""some dehydration"" in severe acute malnutrition?","a)Increased thirst
b)sunken eyes
c)skin pinch that goes back slowly
d)Altered sensorium","Increased thirst is the best indicator of 'some dehydration' in severe acute malnutrition.
Increased thirst is the most reliable indicator because impaired skin pinch and sunken eyes can    also be seen due to loss of subcutaneous fat in a child with acute malnutrition. Altered sensorium is a feature of severe dehydration.
The degree of dehydration is assessed as follows:
Based on the degree of dehydration after history and examination, the estimated fluid loss is calculated as follows:

Q10,"A 5-year-old has the following anthropometry values. According to wHO criteria for malnutrition, what is the diagnosis?","a)severe acute malnutrition
b)Chronic malnutrition
c)Moderate acute malnutrition
d)Acute on chronic malnutrition","According to wHo criteria for malnutrition, the diagnosis of this child is chronic malnutrition. (option B)
Height for age less than -2 SD ( -2.5 in this case) indicates moderate stunting, pointing towards a diagnosis of chronic malnutrition.
weight for age less than -2 SD (-3.2 in this case) indicates underweight but it cannot differentiate between wasting and stunting.
weight for height:
• less than - 3SD suggests severe acute malnutrition (SAM)
• between -2 to -3 SD suggests moderate acute malnutrition
weight for height in this case is -1.7 SD. Hence it is not a case of SAM or moderate acute malnutrition.",,B,

b)Achondroplasia
c)Growth hormone deficiency
d)Hypothyroidism","upper segment to lower segment ratio (u/L) less than 1 indicates spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia.  The upper segment to lower segment (u/L) ratio in this child is o.8. In normal development, the u/L ratio is 1 in children more than 7 years.
The lower segment(L) is defined as the length from the symphysis pubis to the floor. The upper segment(u) is measured by subtracting the lower segment from the height.
The u/L ratio is
• 1.7 at birth

Q13,which of the following MRI findings will be seen in a child with spastic quadriplegia?,"a)periventricular leukomalacia
b)Multicystic encephalomalacia
c)cerebellar degeneration
d)Basal ganglia calcification","Multicystic encephalomalacia is the MRI finding seen in children with spastic quadriplegia.
cerebral palsy is classified into several types based on its clinical features.
spastic quadriplegia is the most common subtype seen in India. It is often caused by perinatal asphyxia and neonatal illness where all four limbs are affected. MRI would reveal multicystic   encephalomalacia. It is associated with a poor outcome.
spastic diplegia is commonly seen in premature infants with a history of birth asphyxia. It is
second most common type of cerebral palsy in India after spastic quadriplegia. Both the lower     limbs are involved, with spasticity in the hip adductors. This leads to a characteristic commando crawling in infants and a scissoring gait in older children. Brain MRI shows scarring and
shrinkage in the periventricular white matter with compensatory enlargement of the cerebral
ventricles, called periventricular leukomalacia (option A). IQ of these children is usually normal



and has a good prognosis.


Spastic hemiplegia affects one-half of the body. It is seen due to a vascular insult leading to a
perinatal stroke event. Early hand preference is seen (before 1 year), where one side of the body is always preferred as the other side is weak. MRI shows focal changes and porencephalic cysts due  to infarcts.
Dyskinetic/ Extrapyramidal palsy is associated with birth asphyxia and kernicterus in the early   neonatal period. Unlike spastic diplegia, the upper limbs are affected more than the lower limb. Brain MRI reveals lesions in the basal ganglia and thalamus (option D).
Cerebellar degenerations are associated with ataxic cerebral palsy (option C).
Note: periventricular leukomalacia can also be seen in spastic quadriplegia but multicystic encephalomalacia is more common.",,B,5752-3638.PNG

height age&gt; chronological age with short stature and increased blood pressure 18o/11o suggests 11 beta hydroxylase deficient variant of CAH.",,A,
Q15,INSURE is associated with which of the following conditions?,"a)Respiratory distress in new born
b)Birth Asphyxia
c)Neonatal jaundice
d)Transient tachypnea of newborn","INSURE is associated with respiratory distress in newborns.



INSURE is abbreviated as intubate-intratracheal surfactant administration-extubation. It is a
treatment modality performed in neonates with respiratory distress especially in preterm where surfactant production is reduced. It is indicated in neonates who are not maintaining oxygen
saturation &gt;9o% while breathing 4o-7o% Fio2 in nasal CPAP(continuous positive airway pressure).
Extubation back to nasal CPAP is done immediately once the infant is stable, usually within    minutes to &lt;1 hr of surfactant administration. The amount of nasal CPAP required usually  decreases after approximately 72 hr of age and most infants can be weaned from nasal CPAP.
Variations of the INSURE method are MIST (minimally invasive surfactant therapy) and LISA (less invasive surfactant administration), in which a small feeding tube, rather than an
endotracheal tube (ETT), is used to deliver intratracheal surfactant to a spontaneously breathing infant on nasal CPAP.
The combination of early rescue surfactant by these methods along with nasal CPAP has been
associated with the reduced need for mechanical ventilation and prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.",,A,
Q16,All of the following are included under diagnostic criteria of severe acute malnutrition except,"a)Height for age
b)weight for height
c)pedal edema
d)MUAC","Height for age is not a diagnostic criterion of severe acute malnutrition.
Criteria for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in a 6-month-old child are mid-upper arm
circumference, symmetrical pedal edema , and weight for height. Height for age is not the criteria for the diagnosis of severe acute malnutrition.
The presence of any of the following confers severe acute malnutrition in children 6 to 59 months of age:
• Weight-for-height below -3 standard deviation (&lt;-3SD) on the WHo Growth Standard (option B)
• Presence of bipedal edema  (option C)
• Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) below 11.5 cm (option D)
once the child is diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition, the doctor must assess for the following complications:
• Severe edema (+++)
• Low appetite (failed appetite test)
• Medical complications (severe anemia, pneumonia, diarrhea, dehydration, cerebral palsy, tuberculosis, HIV, heart disease, etc.)
one or more danger signs as per IMNCI

Q18,which of the following is false regarding neonatal cholestasis?,"a)kasai procedure should be done within 9o days
b)HIDA scan is an investigation of choice
c)Biliary atresia is the most common cause
d)Liver biopsy rules out other causes","kasai procedure should be done within 6o days of age, and not 9o days.  Delay beyond 6o days significantly reduces success rates and increases the risk of requiring liver transplantation.
Neonatal cholestasis refers to prolonged jaundice in newborns caused by impaired bile flow.
option B: HIDA scan is the investigation of choice. The hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA)    scan is used to evaluate bile flow from the liver into the intestine and can help differentiate biliary atresia from other causes of neonatal cholestasis.
option c: Biliary atresia is the most common cause of neonatal cholestasis, this condition requires surgical intervention.
option D: Liver biopsy is a key diagnostic tool in neonatal cholestasis as it can confirm biliary atresia and rule out other causes like metabolic diseases or neonatal hepatitis.",,A,
Q19,what causes the closure of ductus arteriosus?,"a)Increase in oxygen
b)Decrease in Co2
c)Increase in pulmonary vascular resistance
d)Fall in concentration of catecholamines","An increase in oxygen causes the closure of ductus arteriosus.
Mechanism of closure of the ductus arteriosus:
1. Functional closure (Minutes to Hours): Increased oxygen tension (Pao■) after birth causes      smooth muscle contraction in the ductus. Decreased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels (due to loss of placental production and increased pulmonary clearance) also contribute.
2. Anatomical closure (Days to weeks): smooth muscle proliferation and fibrosis lead to permanent closure, forming the ligamentum arteriosum.
Thus, oxygen, reduced PGE2, and smooth muscle constriction drive ductus closure.
changes in vascular resistance at birth:



Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR): Before birth, the lungs are fluid-filled, and PVR is high. At birth, with the first breath, the lungs expand, oxygen tension rises, and pulmonary blood flow
increases. This causes a decrease in PVR.
Systemic vascular resistance (SVR): At birth, clamping of the umbilical cord eliminates the low-resistance placental circulation. This leads to an increase in SVR.",,A,
Q20,A 4-year-old child was diagnosed with croup. which of the following is the most common causative organism?,"a)Hemophilus influenza
b)streptococcus pneumonia
c)Influenza virus
d)Diphtheria","Among the options, the Influenza virus is the most common causative organism of croup.
croup, or laryngotracheobronchitis, is a viral infection affecting the upper airway, primarily in children aged 6 months to 6 years. It causes inflammation of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi, leading to characteristic symptoms such as:
• Barking cough (seal-like cough)
• Inspiratory stridor
• Hoarseness
• Respiratory distress in severe cases
The most common causative organism for croup is the parainfluenza virus. while other viruses like influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus can also cause croup,
parainfluenza is the predominant cause.
Management:
• Racemic epinephrine nebulization leads to the rapid improvement of upper airway obstruction.   Epinephrine constricts pre-capillary arterioles in the upper airway mucosa and decreases capillary hydrostatic pressure, leading to fluid resorption and improvement in airway edema.
• Dexamethasone-by the least invasive route (oral&gt;IV&gt;IM ). It is indicated in all the grades of croup.
• oxygen should be administered to children who are hypoxemic (Spo2 &lt;92 %) Antibiotics are not indicated in laryngotracheobronchitis.
other options:
option A:  Hemophilus influenza is associated with epiglottitis.
option B:  Streptococcus pneumonia is associated with pneumonia, otitis media, or meningitis, not croup.
option D:  Diphtheria is associated with pseudomembrane in the throat and airway obstruction",,C,

Q22,which of the following is not true about breastmilk jaundice?,"a)Most of the children require phototherapy
b)Exclusive breastfeeding with a total bilirubin of more than 1omg/dl after 3-4 weeks of birth
c)unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia","Most of the children suffering from breastmilk jaundice do not require phototherapy.
Breastmilk jaundice is due to significant unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (option D), after the 7th day and may last for 2–3 weeks. This may be caused by the breast milk that might contain
β-glucuronidase, which deconjugates intestinal bilirubin and promotes its absorption and other   inhibitors of glucuronyl transferase. persistently high bilirubin levels may require changing from



breast milk to infant formula for 24–48 h and/or treatment with phototherapy, without cessation of breastfeeding. (option A)
Most cases of breast milk jaundice are mild and self-limiting, and phototherapy is required only in rare severe cases where bilirubin levels are significantly elevated. (option B)
Breast milk jaundice is typically observed in exclusively breastfed infants, often with elevated  bilirubin (&gt;10mg/dl) levels persisting beyond the neonatal period (after 3-4 weeks of birth).

Q23,which of the following is not a feature of cystic fibrosis?,"a)Nasal polyposis
b)Biliary atresia
c)Meconium ileus
d)Bleeding diathesis","Biliary atresia is not a feature of cystic fibrosis.
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the lungs, digestive system, and     other organs. It is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which leads to the production of thick and sticky mucus. The CFTR gene is on chromosome 7q. The most common CFTR mutation is    F508 deletion. This mucus blocks ducts and passages in various organs, causing problems.
Features of CF:
• Respiratory symptoms: Chronic cough, recurrent lung infections, bronchiectasis, and nasal polyps. (option A)
• Digestive Issues: pancreatic insufficiency, malabsorption, meconium ileus (option C), and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies which causes bleeding diathesis (option D).
• sweat Gland Abnormalities: Elevated sweat chloride levels.
• Reproductive: Infertility in males (due to absent vas deferens) and reduced fertility in females.
• other Complications: CF-related diabetes (CFRD), osteoporosis, and liver disease.


The diagnosis is confirmed if both of the following criteria are met:
1. presence of



• Clinical symptoms affecting at least one organ system (respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary) or
• Positive newborn screening or
• A sibling with cystic fibrosis.
2. Evidence of dysfunction of the CFTR gene by
• Two positive sweat chloride test results were obtained on separate days or
• Identification of two CFTR mutations by genetic testing or
• An abnormal measurement of nasal potential difference.
Cystic fibrosis requires a multidisciplinary approach to management. The correction of the defect can be done via:
• Lumacaftor, corrects the misfolding and reverts the mutation defect.
• Ivacaftor potentiates CFTR channel opening and stimulates ion transport.

breakdown. Its deficiency leads to delayed wound healing, spontaneous bleeding, and in severe cases, life-threatening hemorrhages.
Presents with recurrent umbilical bleeding since birth and Epistaxis and rectal bleeding
Laboratory Findings: Normal PT, PTT, TT, platelet count and function: These indicate that the   coagulation cascade and platelets are functioning normally up to fibrin formation. Positive urea clot solubility test: This is a classic diagnostic test for Factor XIII deficiency. Clots deficient in    Factor XIII dissolve in 5M urea because they lack cross-linked fibrin
The preferred treatment is FXIII concentrates. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate are alternatives. Antifibrinolytics like tranexamic acid can be adjunctive for minor bleeding. Regular   monitoring and prophylaxis are crucial for long-term management and preventing complications.
other options:
option B: Factor XI: Deficiency typically causes mild to moderate bleeding, mainly in mucosal sites, and does not present with umbilical bleeding.
PT and PTT may be prolonged, which is not the case here.
option C: Factor X: Deficiency causes severe bleeding and affects PT and PTT (both would be prolonged), unlike in this case where all tests are normal.
option D: Factor XII: Deficiency does not cause bleeding; it is often asymptomatic. It can lead to prolonged PTT, which is not observed here.",,A,
Q25,which of the following indicates the primary failure of recovery in an admitted patient with severe acute malnutrition?,"a)i,ii,iii
b)i,ii,iv
c)i,iii,iv
d)ii,iii,iv","Failure to regain appetite by day 4, failure to start to loose edema by day 4 and presence of edema by day 1o indicate primary failure of recovery in admitted patient with severe acute malnutrition.
For assessing primary failure of recovery in a patient with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), key clinical benchmarks guide the evaluation.
Difference between primary and secondary failure of malnutrition treatment:
Inpatient cases
Day of admission is considered as day o.
