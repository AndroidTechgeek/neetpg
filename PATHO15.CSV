b)RET
c)MET
d)KRAs","The most common mutation associated with the microscopy image which shows the orphan
Annie eye nuclei which is characteristic of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid is the BRAF v6OOE mutation.
papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common thyroid cancer. It is also the most predominant thyroid cancer in children and iodine-sufficient areas. Radiation exposure is an important risk
factor.
Genetics :
BRAF gain-of-function mutation (v6OOE amino acid substitution) is commonly associated.



RET/pTc rearrangements NTRK gene fusions
The clinical features of papillary thyroid carcinoma are as follows :
• It is more common in females
• The mean age of presentation is 3O-4O years
• Most patients are euthyroid, with painless swelling. Initial presentation may be with cervical lymphadenopathy due to lymph node metastases.
• These are usually multifocal (85% cases)
• They appear as cold masses on thyroid scan
• Metastasis occurs via the lymphatic route
• skip metastasis from papillary thyroid carcinoma to the ipsilateral cervical lymph nodes, known as lateral aberrant thyroid, is managed with modified radical neck dissection
Microscopic features of papillary thyroid carcinoma include :
• Branching papillae with fibrovascular stalk
• covering epithelium is simple or stratified cuboidal
• orphan Annie eye nuclei -  Empty-appearing nuclei due to dispersed chromatin, they are diagnostic, regardless of papillary architecture
• psammoma bodies - concentric calcified structures, foci of lymphatic invasion

Q4,"A patient presented with abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly and wBC count &gt;5o,ooo/mm3. which of the following genes is involved in this case?","a)t (15:17)
b)Del 1q
c)t (9:22)
d)Del 3q","The clinical scenario of abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, a TLC of &gt; 5o,ooo/mm3 points toward the diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) which results from reciprocal
translocation t(9:22) forming the BCR-ABL fusion gene.
CML is a hematopoietic stem cell disorder that is common in males 55-65 years of age. It occurs due to the translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, forming
the philadelphia chromosome. This results in the activation of tyrosine kinase, which causes
abnormal cellular proliferation. Common presenting features are fatigue, malaise, weight loss, and splenomegaly.
Blood investigations show anemia, leucocytosis, and thrombocytosis. It has decreased levels of leucocyte alkaline phosphatase due to a relative increase in abnormal myeloid cells. The
emergence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors as first-line therapy has dramatically improved survival for these patients. Imatinib is the most commonly used tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for CML.
The image below shows peripheral smear findings of CML with neutrophils, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, and band cells.


option A: translocation (15:17) - This is seen in the acute promyelocytic variant of acute myeloid    leukaemia. Clinically, the patients present with symptoms resulting due to pancytopenia (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia).  For acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) diagnosis, the blast
cell count should be ≥2o% in the peripheral blood or bone marrow. peripheral smears (as depicted below) would show the classic intracytoplasmic Auer rods (red arrows) :





option C: The 1q21.1 deletion syndrome itself does not lead to a clinically recognizable syndrome. Some patients can present with dysmorphic facial features, mild intellectual disability,
microcephaly, and eye abnormalities.
option D: The 3q29 deletion syndrome clinically presents with psychiatric manifestations
including mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, executive function deficits, and psychosis.",,C,Picture14.png;2324-1509.PNG
Q5,"A 55-year-old chronic smoker presents with weight loss, hemoptysis and TTF-1 positivity. what is the possible diagnosis?","a)squamous cell carcinoma
b)small cell carcinoma
c)Adenocarcinoma
d)Large cell carcinoma","The clinical scenario cough, hemoptysis, weight loss with image showing immunohistochemical marker thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) positivity is suggestive of adenocarcinoma of the    lung.
Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer seen in women and
nonsmokers. Adenocarcinomas are usually located in the periphery as compared to other lung
tumors and are relatively smaller in size. Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia is a precursor lesion of adenocarcinoma.
Molecular genetics show frequent mutations in EGFR, ALK, RoS, MET, and RET (Receptor tyrosine kinase genes) or KRAS mutations. The majority express TTF-1, which is a protein    required for normal lung development. Napsin A is a new marker and is more sensitive and specific than TTF-1 in the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.
Microscopic examination shows a lepidic pattern of growth at the periphery of the tumor. The tumor cells appear to crawl along the normal-appearing alveolar septa, as shown in the image below.





Thyroid transcription factor 1 (known as NKX2-1 or thyroid-specific enhancer binding protein) is a nuclear immunohistochemistry marker with preferential expression in thyroid, lung and brain
structures of diencephalic origin. It is positive in adenocarcinoma of the lungs.
The image below shows the immunohistochemistry marker TTF-1 in lung adenocarcinoma


other options:
option A: p4o and p63 are markers of squamous cell carcinoma lung. It is the most common
cancer found in smokers. Histologically it is characterized by the presence of keratinization and markedly eosinophilic cytoplasm as shown below.





option B: Chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56 are the markers of small cell carcinoma lung. Due to the encrustation by DNA from the necrotic cancer cells, vascular walls in the necrotic area take up basophilic staining as shown below. This is called the Azzopardi effect.


option D: Large cell carcinoma is an undifferentiated malignant epithelial tumour that lacks the  cytologic features of other forms of lung cancer. They do not express markers of adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.
The image below shows large cell undifferentiated carcinoma",,C,2325-1511.PNG;2325-1510.PNG;2326-1513.PNG;2326-1512.PNG;2327-1514.PNG
Q6,"A patient presents with flank pain and hematuria. The histology slide of the patient is
provided. Based on the clinical presentation and histological findings, which of the following conditions is most likely?","a)chromophobe renal cell carcinoma
b)clear cell carcinoma
c)Metastasis
d)Papillary cell carcinoma","The given histological image is of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. It can be identified by the presence of pale eosinophilic cells arranged in the form of solid sheets with some cells having a  perinuclear halo.
Chromophobe carcinoma is thought to arise from the intercalated cells of the collecting ducts. It is composed of cells with prominent cell membranes and pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, usually with a halo around the nucleus. It shows large cells having a plant-cell-like appearance. They are
arranged in solid sheets with a concentration of the largest cells around blood vessels.
Cytogenetic examination of the tumour shows multiple chromosome losses and extreme hypodiploidy. It has an excellent prognosis compared to clear cell and papillary cancers.
Close differential diagnoses are as follows:
• oncocytoma: They also consist of large eosinophilic cells having small, round, benign-appearing nuclei that have large nucleoli. However, they do not show a perinuclear halo.
• Clear cell RCC: pale eosinophilic cytoplasm in chromophobe RCC distinguishes it from the clear appearance of the cytoplasm due to the accumulation of glycogen and lipids in clear-cell RCC.

Q7,"A patient came to the OPD with complaints of vomiting and diarrhoea along with skin
eruptions. He gives the history of similar episodes in the past. After switching to gluten free diet his symptoms resolved. which marker is useful in diagnosing this condition?","a)ASCA
b)ANCA
c)Anti tissue transglutaminase antibody
d)Anti-parietal Antibody","The given scenario of vomiting, diarrhoea, skin eruptions and resolving symptoms with gluten
free diet along with crypt hperplasia, villous atrophy and intra epithelial lymphocyte as seen in
histopathology are suggestive of celiac disease. Anti tissue transglutaminase antibody will help in diagnosing this condition.


small intestinal adenocarcinoma is also associated with celiac disease.
celiac disease or celiac sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy is triggered by the ingestion of
gluten, which is the major storage protein of wheat and similar grains. It usually affects the 2nd part of the duodenum or proximal jejunum.
Antibodies associated with celiac disease are:



• Anti-gliadin antibodies
• Anti tissue transglutaminase antibodies
• Anti endomysial antibodies
MARsH's score is used to assess celiac disease histologically.
Dermatitis herpetiformis occurs in about 1o% of patients with celiac disease.
other options :
option A : serological markers that are usually positive in patients with crohn's disease include the anti–saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (AscA).
option B : Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANcA)-associated vasculitis is categorized into 3 distinct forms:  Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; formerly wegener granulomatosis),
Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, formerly called churg–strauss syndrome (css).
option D : Anti-parietal cell antibody is positive in patients with Pernicious anemia.",2306-1496.PNG,C,2328-1515.PNG
Q8,"A 2 day old child is brought to the OPD. Mother complains that child is not feeding well and has bilious vomiting. The child is diagnosed with congenital megacolon and aganglionic
segment of the colon is shown. which of the following layers are affected in this condition?","a)Layer 1 and 2
b)Layer 2 and 3
c)Layer 3 and 4
d)Layer 1 and 4","The clinical presentation of bilious vomiting, congenital megacolon and aganglionic segment of   the colonis suggestive of Hirschsprung’s disease. The layers 2 and 3 representing the submucosa and muscularis, respectively, are affected by this condition.
Hirschsprung disease or congenital aganglionic colon is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the submucosal (Meissner) plexus - Layer 2 and myenteric (Auerbach) plexus - Layer 3 of the distal intestinal segment. This is because of the premature arrest of normal migration of
neural crest cells from the cecum to the rectum.
It causes a muscular spasm of the distal intestinal segment, resulting in functional obstruction of the affected bowel and proximal dilation (megacolon). The area between the dilated and
contracted segments is referred to as the transition zone.
The image below shows layers of the colon





Hirschsprung disease is classified into -
• short-segment - limited to the rectosigmoid segment
• Long-segment - proximal extension beyond the rectosigmoid segment
Note: while the gold standard investigation for Hirschsprung’s disease is rectal suction biopsy, an imaging study will first be required to figure out the location from where the sample needs to be   taken.
The image below shows dilated ganglionic and contracted aganglionic segments in Hirschsprung's disease,


It is more common in males. Most infants present with abdominal distension and bilious vomiting with failure to pass meconium within the first 24 hours of life. Enterocolitis is a potentially fatal     complication.
It may be familial or associated with Down syndrome. The following gene mutations can be seen,



• Mutations in chromosome 1o (loss-of-function mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase RET) or chromosome 13
• glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) mutations
GDNF promotes the survival, proliferation, and migration of neural crest cells in culture. It is     expressed in the gut in advance of migrating neural crest cells and is chemoattractive for neural crest cells in culture.
The investigations for Hirschsprung’s disease include:
water-soluble contrast enema is the initial investigation. It shows a narrow aganglionic segment,   a conical transition zone, and a dilated proximal bowel. It helps in excluding other causes of distal intestinal obstruction, such as colonic atresia, meconium ileus, and meconium plug syndrome. It   is both diagnostic and therapeutic for the latter.
A contrast enema image in Hirschsprung's disease is shown below,


Rectal biopsy is the gold standard investigation. It shows the following:
• Absent ganglia
• Hypertrophied nerve trunks
• positive immunostaining for acetylcholinesterase
• calretinin immunostaining (superior to acetylcholinesterase staining)
The ideal site to obtain a rectal biopsy in a patient with Hirschsprung's disease is from a point that is at least 2 cm above the dentate line to avoid sampling the normal aganglionated region of the
internal sphincter.
Anorectal manometry shows the failure of the relaxation of the internal anal sphincter. It can be performed in older children, but it is relatively inaccurate and rarely used.
The management of Hirschsprung’s disease is as follows:
surgery is the definitive treatment. A multi-stage approach may be adopted. A colostomy is done in the newborn period, followed by a definitive pull-through operation when the child is over 1o



kgs.
Definitive surgeries for Hirschsprung disease are as follows:
• swenson
• Duhamel
• soave",2306-1495.PNG,B,2330-1518.PNG;2330-1517.PNG;2331-1519.PNG
Q9,"A COPD patient with a history of smoking presents with respiratory symptoms. High
resolution CT showed panacinar emphysema. which enzyme deficiency is associated with this condition?","a)Alpha-1 antitrypsin
b)Elastase
c)Chymotrypsin
d)Type 2 surfactant","Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is associated with panacinar emphysema.
panacinar or panlobular emphysema is associated with α1 antitrypsin (α1AT) deficiency. It is exacerbated by smoking. panacinar occurs more commonly in lower zones and the anterior
margins of the lung. In this type, the acini from respiratory bronchiole to terminal blind alveoli are uniformly enlarged.
α1AT deficiency is an autosomal-recessive disorder of protein misfolding. Deficiency of α1AT protein results in excessive degradation of alveoli by neutrophil elastase causing panacinar
emphysema. It also causes liver disease as a consequence of the abnormal accumulation of the misfolded protein within hepatocytes.  α1AT deficiency is characterized by the presence of
round-to-oval cytoplasmic globular inclusions in hepatocytes. These hepatocytes are
strongly periodic acid–schiff positive and diastase resistant.
Trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase are endopeptidases. They cleave the internal peptide bonds. Trypsin is specific for cleavage at the sites of basic amino acids, while chymotrypsin and elastase are specific for cleavage at neutral amino acids.
other options:
option B: Elastase is inhibited by alpha-1 antitrypsin. In the case of alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, there is the destruction of lung tissue (elastin) by the elastase released by macrophages.
option C: Chymotrypsin degrades trypsin and protects the pancreas from trypsin-related injury.
option D: Type 2 surfactant deficiency is associated with respiratory distress syndrome as type 2 pneumocytes produce the surfactant which decreases the surface tension.",2295-1486.PNG,A,
Q10,"A 34-year-old female presented with low Hb, platelet count of 25ooo/mm3, raised PT and aPTT. A peripheral smear is given. which of the following fusion genes is affected?","a)BCRABL
b)IGH NSD2
c)RUNX1 RUNX1T1
d)PML RARA","The image showing numerous Auer rods and the lab findings pointing towards DIC are suggestive of acute myeloid leukaemia - M3 or acute promyelocytic leukaemia. The pathogenesis behind this  is the pML-RARA fusion gene or translocation t(15,17).
AML-M3, or acute promyelocytic leukemia, is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia associated with pML-RAR■ fusion gene or t(15;17). The patient presents with fever, fatigue, and weight loss. on
examination, findings consistent with anemia (pallor) and thrombocytopenia (easy bruising) are seen. This is due to the accelerated destruction of RBC and platelet precursors in the bone
marrow.



Histopathology of the bone marrow aspirate reveals numerous Auer rods (needle-like azurophilic granules) in the cytoplasm of the promyelocytes. sometimes, multiple Auer rods cluster together  within a single cell resembling a bundle of sticks. such cells have been termed faggot cells (faggot in French means bundle of sticks).
The condition is associated with a high incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Treatment includes the administration of all-trans retinoic acid.
other options:
option A: CML is a myeloproliferative neoplasm. It is caused by BCR (on chromosome 22) - ABL (on chromosome 9) fusion gene translocation mutation. It results in the formation of the
philadelphia chromosome.
option B: Multiple myeloma patients are affected by the translocation t(4;14) resulting in the
IGH::NsD2 fusion.
option C: AML with t(8:21) shows the RUNX1/RUNXT1 fusion gene.",2308-1497.PNG,D,
Q11,"A 12-year-old child comes with cervical lymphadenopathy. Lymph node biopsy shows CD 1o + , CD 19 + , CD 2o +, CD 5 -, CD 23 -, and Tdt -. what is the diagnosis?","a)Diffuse large B cell lymphoma
b)Acute Lymphoid Leukemia
c)Mantle cell lymphoma
d)Burkitt lymphoma","The clinical scenario of a child with cervical lymph node, which is positive for CD 1o, 19, and 2o    and negative for CD 5, 23, and tdt and the histopathology showing tumour cells showing a diffuse monotonous pattern with clumped and dispersed chromatin in the nuclei along with deeply
basophilic cytoplasm containing lipid vacuoles points towards a diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma.
Burkitt lymphoma is a highly aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is characterized by the translocation of the c-Myc gene on chromosome 8. This leads to increased MYC protein
levels. The translocation most commonly seen in Burkitt's lymphoma is t(8;14).
It can occur in 3 forms that have distinct clinical characteristics:
• African (endemic) Burkitt lymphoma presents as a mass involving the mandible. It may also involve the abdominal viscera, particularly the kidneys, ovaries, and adrenal glands.
• sporadic (non-endemic) is often seen as a mass involving the ileocecum and peritoneum.
• Aggressive lymphoma or acute leukaemia is seen in immunocompromised individuals
Histopathology shows tumour cells with round or oval nuclei, coarse chromatin, small
nucleoli, minimal cytoplasm, and a high mitotic index. The phagocytes have abundant clear
cytoplasm, creating a characteristic “starry sky” pattern. Bone marrow aspiration shows tumour cells with royal blue cytoplasm containing clear cytoplasmic vacuoles.
The tumour cells express surface IgM, CD19, CD2o, CD1o, and BCL6, a phenotype consistent with a germinal centre B-cell origin.

Q12,Identify the disease with the chromosomal abnormality?,"a)Angelman syndrome
b)Prader willi syndrome
c)cri-du chat syndrome
d)Rett syndrome","paternal deletion of 15q12 is seen in prader-willi syndrome as shown in the image.



prader-willi syndrome is a type of non-Mendelian mode of inheritance and genomic imprinting disorder. It occurs due to the deletion of band 15q12 on the paternal chromosome and the
silencing of the same set of genes derived from maternal chromosomes. It is characterized by
mental retardation, obesity, hyperphagia, hypogonadism, short stature, small hands and feet, and abnormal facial features like a small upturned nose, narrow bifrontal distance and thin upper lip.
other options:
option A: Angelman syndrome is characterized by the deletion of the ubiquitin ligase gene  (UBE3A) on maternal chromosome 15q12 and the silencing of the paternal chromosomal      counterpart. It is characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly, ataxic gait, seizures, inappropriate laughter and so is also known as the 'happy puppet syndrome'.
option c: cri-du chat syndrome due to partial deletion or monosomy of short arm chromosome 5.
option D: Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder. It is caused by a mutation in the
MEcp-2 gene. The disorder is mostly seen in girls because affected boys usually die in infancy due to a defective single X chromosome.

b)Tuberous sclerosis complex
c)von Hippel-Lindau syndrome
d)Neurofibromatosis","The given clinical history of left flank pain, hematuria, weight loss, headache, nausea, and
convulsions along with the family history of brain tumours and kidney tumours is suggestive of Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. (VHL)
VHL syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and is characterized by a
predisposition to a variety of neoplasms, particularly hemangioblastomas of the cerebellum and    retina. Hundreds of bilateral renal cysts, often multiple, clear cell carcinomas develop in 4o% to   6o% of affected persons. Those with VHL syndrome inherit a germline mutation of the VHL gene on chromosome 3p. A 'second hit' can lead to manifestations as described below.
other options:
option A: Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a defect in the tumour suppressor gene p53 located on chromosome 17. It is characterised by Sarcomas,    Leukaemia, osteosarcomas, Brain tumours and Adrenocortical carcinomas.



option B: Tuberous sclerosis is caused by to mutation of genes coding for hamartin (chromosome 9) and tuberin (chromosome 16), which leads to the formation of hamartomas, subependymal
nodules, and astrocytomas. Skin manifestation includes facial angiofibroma (adenoma sebaceum), shagreen patch and confetti skin lesions. It can also be associated with renal angiomyolipoma and cardiac rhabdomyoma.
option D: Neurofibromatosis-1 is caused by the autosomal dominant loss-of-function mutations in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17. It is a tumour suppressor gene that encodes neurofibromin, a
negative RAS regulator. It can present with café-au-lait macules (CALMs), axillary or inguinal freckling, Lisch nodules, neurofibromas, pseudoarthrosis, and optic gliomas.

Q14,A patient with cOPD presented with ARDS symptoms. what is the role of IL-8 in inflammation?,"a)Endothelial activation
b)Recuritement of neutrophils
c)Macrophage activation
d)promote surfactant production","IL-8 (CXCL8) is secreted by activated macrophages and endothelial cells which causes activation and recruitment of neutrophils.
once leukocytes have exited the circulation, they move towards the inciting stimulus by chemotaxis. This process is mediated by:
Exogenous chemoattractants, such as bacterial products as well as endogenous chemoattractants:
cytokines of the chemokine family (e.g., IL-8), components of the complement system (particularly C5a), and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites (mainly leukotriene B4).",,B,
Q15,which of the following is incorrect about iron metabolism?,"a)Free serum iron is toxic to cells
b)Iron is stored in the body in the form of ferritin
c)serum ferritin denotes the iron levels in the body
d)Iron is transported by binding with apoferritin","Iron is transported by ferroportin and not apoferritin. Apoferritin is a storage form of iron.
Apoferritin is present in the intestinal mucosa membrane and it binds and stores iron, by combining with a ferric hydroxide–phosphate compound to form ferritin.(option B)



Iron absorption occurs in the duodenum. Iron in our gut exists in 2 forms, they are non-heme and heme iron. Luminal non-heme iron is mostly in the Fe3+ (ferric) state and is reduced to Fe2+
(ferrous) iron by ferrireductases such as duodenal cytochrome B. Fe2+ iron is then transported     across the apical membrane by divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). Heme iron is moved across   the apical membrane into the cytoplasm through heme transporters such as heme carrier protein 1 and heme oxygenase 2.
In the duodenal cells, Fe2+ iron can be transported to the blood or stored as mucosal iron. Fe2+ form of iron is transported from the cytoplasm into circulation by the protein ferroportin. A
protein called hephaestin is associated with ferroportin 1. It is not a transporter itself, but it facilitates basolateral transport.
once in circulation, Fe2+ is again oxidized back to Fe3+ iron by hephaestin and ceruloplasmin.    The newly absorbed Fe3+ iron binds rapidly to transferrin and is delivered to red cell progenitors in the marrow. Hepcidin is a protein secreted from the liver that plays a major role in the
regulation of iron absorption. when the body’s iron stores are adequate, it downregulates the expression of ferroportin and thereby decreases iron absorption.


other options:
option A: Free serum iron is toxic to cells. After entering cells, free iron gathers in the
mitochondria. This produces free radicals, catalyses lipid peroxidation, interferes with oxidative phosphorylation, and eventually results in cell death.
option C: serum ferritin denotes the iron levels in the body.",,D,

Q17,"A 38-year-old woman came with complaints of a slowly growing breast lump for the last 6 months. she had a history of a similar lump for which excision was done and medical and mammographic reports are not available. on examination, the lump was smooth,
well-defined, mobile and with regular margins. The cytology and biopsy of the same were taken and are shown below. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Leiomyosarcoma
b)Fibroadenoma
c)sclerosing adenosis
d)phyllodes tumor","The given clinical scenario and the image showing leaf-like architecture, stromal cellularity and mitotic figures are suggestive of phyllodes tumor.


phyllodes tumour is a fibroepithelial tumour arising from the intralobular stroma. It presents as a smooth, rapidly growing, multinodular, painless breast lump that is usually palpable. It most
commonly presents in the 6th decade of life and is associated with:
• Gain in chromosome 1q
• HOXB13 overexpression
phyllodes tumours show stromal cellularity next to the epithelium (subepithelial or peri
epithelial regions). This feature helps to differentiate it from intracanalicular fibroadenoma.
The prognosis of phyllodes tumours depends on their histological grade. Most phyllodes tumours are low-grade, with limited stromal cellularity. They recur only occasionally and do not
metastasize.
The features of malignant (intermediate and high grade) phyllodes tumours are:
• Markedly increased stromal cellularity
• stromal overgrowth - the absence of epithelial elements
• Nuclear atypia
• Increased mitosis (&gt;1o/ 1o hpf)
• Highly recurrent
Regardless of the grade, lymphatic spread is rare in phyllodes tumours. Hence, axillary lymph node dissection is contraindicated.



Note: Mitotic figures indicate active cell division, reflecting the tumour's proliferative nature.
Their presence, particularly when abundant or atypical, can suggest a higher tumour grade and potential aggressiveness.

option A: Leiomyosarcoma is a malignant smooth muscle cell tumour that arises from the
myometrium or endometrial stromal precursor cells. Grossly polypoid masses that protrude into  the uterine lumen, or large, fleshy masses that invade the uterine wall. cytologic atypia is seen in histology, ranging from highly anaplastic to extremely well differentiated. Histopathology of
leiomyosarcoma shows variable atypia, often with cytoplasmic vacuoles at both ends of nuclei, which is given below:


option B: Fibroadenoma is a form of aberrations of normal development and involution of the
breast (ANDI), and it is the most common cause of a breast lump in women aged 15–25 years. It    arises from hyperplasia of a single lobule and presents as a well-circumscribed, smooth or lobular, firm, non-tender, freely mobile mass (mouse in the breast). The histopathology shows the
proliferation of intralobular stroma, and the epithelium may be surrounded by stroma (pericanalicular pattern) or compressed and distorted (intracanalicular pattern). The    histopathology image is given below:





option C: sclerosing adenosis is a benign condition where the breast lobules contain fibrous tissue that resembles scars. Histopathology shows a complex entity with a prominent myoepithelium
and stromal fibrosis, comprised of enlarged and distorted lobules with duplicated and crowded acini. The image is given below:",2311-1500.PNG,D,2339-1523.PNG;2340-1524.PNG;2341-1526.PNG;2341-1525.PNG
Q18,"A 72-year-old man came with generalised anascarca and icterus. He had hepatosplenomegaly. kidney function tests were found to be deranged and his urine gammaglobulins were more
than 3gm/dl. Electrophoresis of the urine protein is shown below. which is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Multiple Myeloma - IgM
b)Multiple Myeloma - IgA
c)Multiple Myeloma - IgG
d)Monoclonal gammopathy of undifferentiated proteins","The given clinical scenario along with deranged RFT, urine gammaglobulins &gt;3gm/dl, and urine electrophoresis showing IgM kappa paraprotein is suggestive of multiple myeloma.
The electrophoresis pattern of multiple myeloma would typically show:
• Monoclonal spike (M-spike): A distinct peak in the gamma region, representing the high concentration of the IgM kappa paraprotein.



• Reduced or Absent polyclonal Immunoglobulins(IgG, IgA), indicating a suppression of normal antibody production.
• Increased kappa light chains, with a corresponding decrease in lambda light chains, confirm the kappa light chain restriction.
Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell neoplasm commonly associated with lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, renal failure, and acquired immune abnormalities.
poor prognostic factors for multiple myeloma:
• serum β2-microglobulin. It is the single most powerful predictor
• Deletion of 17pITp53 sequences and the translocations t(14;16) and t(14;2o)
• polyclonal serum Immunoglobulins
• Elevated lactate dehydrogenase
• High C-reactive protein
• Increased plasma cell proliferative activity
• High degree of bone marrow replacement
• presence of plasmablastic morphology
• Elevated serum soluble receptor for IL6
Multiple myeloma usually presents as destructive plasma cell tumors involving the axial skeleton. The bones most commonly affected in descending order of frequency are the vertebral column,
ribs, skull, pelvis, femur, clavicle, and scapula.
Radiographically, bone lesions appear as punched-out defects, usually 1 to 4 cm in diameter, and consist of soft, gelatinous, red tumor masses.
Radiograph of the skull showing punched out lesions:


Morphology:



• Malignant plasma cells have a perinuclear clearing due to a prominent golgi apparatus and an eccentrically placed nucleus.
• Relatively normal-appearing plasma cells, plasmablasts with vesicular nuclear chromatin and a prominent single nucleolus, or bizarre, multinucleated cells may predominate.
• other cytologic variants include flame cells, Mott cells.
• Flame cells have fiery red cytoplasm, Mott cells contain multiple grapelike cytoplasmic
droplets, a variety of other inclusions, including fibrils, crystalline rods, and globules. The
globular inclusions are referred to as Russell bodies (if cytoplasmic) or Dutcher bodies (if nuclear).
• Rouleaux formation is characteristic but not specific. High levels of M protein in the blood
causes red cells to stick to one another in linear arrays in smears leading to rouleaux formation.

Peripheral smear of multiple myeloma:


Bence Jones proteins are excreted in the kidney and causes myeloma kidney. Most myelomas are associated with more than 3 g/dL of serum Ig and/or more than 6 mg/dL of urine Bence Jones
protein. The most common monoclonal Immunoglobulin (M protein) is IgG followed by IgA.
The clinicopathologic diagnosis of multiple myeloma can be done based on the identification of clonal plasma cells in the marrow and the presence of CRAB criteria (hypercalcemia,
renal dysfunction, anemia, and bone lesions).",2312-1502.PNG,A,Picture15.png;Picture16.png;2342-1527.PNG
Q19,"A 53-year-old woman came with complaints of fatigue, nausea, anasarca and proteinuria. she had anaemia and neutropenia. Her Bone marrow examination showed 22% plasma cells and  acellular eosinophilic deposits. The bone marrow biopsy is shown below. what is the
associated pathology?","a)Bone marrow - fibrinoid necrosis
b)Bone marrow - coagulative necrosis
c)Amyloidosis
d)Myxomatous degeneration of the bone marrow","The clinical scenario along with the bone marrow biopsy showing increased plasma cells(poor prognosis) showing PAS positive eosinophilic substance is suggestive of amyloidosis.
Amyloidosis refers to extracellular deposits of fibrillar proteins. Abnormal fibrils are produced by the aggregation of misfolded proteins. The fibrillar deposits bind a wide variety
of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, including heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate, and plasma proteins, notably serum amyloid P component (SAP).
Amyloid appears as an amorphous, eosinophilic, hyaline, extracellular substance. The most
common organ involved in AL amyloidosis is renal tissue. kidneys are the most frequently
involved organ and are affected in 7o–8o% of patients. The heart is the second most commonly    affected organ (5o–6o% of patients), and cardiac involvement is the leading cause of death from   AL amyloidosis. Renal amyloidosis usually manifests as proteinuria, often in the nephrotic range, and is associated with hypoalbuminemia, secondary hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia,  and oedema or anasarca.
Note: The plasma cells in amyloidosis usually will be between 7% to 1o%, higher plasma cells indicate poor prognosis.
other options:



option A: Fibrinoid necrosis is usually the result of the deposition of immune complexes and plasma proteins in the arterial wall. on biopsy, fibrinoid necrosis appears as bright pink and  amorphous deposits in the vessel wall.
option B: coagulative necrosis is the most common form of necrosis which mostly is found to
occur in solid organs ( except the brain ). The affected tissue has a preserved architecture and firm texture for several days. The injury leads to the denaturation of structural protein leading to
eosinophilic cells with reddish nuclei and a glossy appearance due to loss of glycogen. The cells may also present with a moth-eaten vacuolated appearance due to digestion of organelles by
lysosomal enzymes. The dead cell debris is ultimately removed by phagocytosis.
option D: Bone marrow necrosis (BMN) and myxomatous stromal changes are rare histologic findings. These changes have been observed in several illnesses, including disseminated
carcinomatosis, cases following chemotherapy, persistent infections, and marrow infiltrative disorders.",2312-1501.PNG,C,
Q20,"A 45 year old man came with complaints of tearing chest pain, tachycardia, and hypotension  with negative Trop I and T. The wall of the aorta was biopsied and the image is shown below. what is the most likely pathology behind it?","a)connective tissue damage of the aortic wall
b)Fibrinoid necrosis and smooth muscle hyperplasia
c)Fat deposition and smooth muscle degeneration
d)Immune complex vasculitis","The given clinical scenario with features such as tearing chest pain, tachycardia, and hypotension   with negative Trop I and T(indicating no myocardial infarction) with biopsy showing separation of the tunica intima and tunica media is suggestive of aortic dissection secondary to connective
tissue damage of the aortic wall.
Dissection occurs when blood enters into the media to form a blood-filled channel between the
laminar planes ofthe media. It usually occurs due to a tear in the intima which allows blood in the lumen to flow into the media. It may also occur due to the rupture of vasa vasorum.
It occurs due to:
• Hypertension
• connective tissue defects like Marfan syndrome
• Iatrogenic trauma during coronary catheterization or cardiopulmonary bypass
Note: Fibrinoid necrosis, commonly seen in Malignant hypertension, Rheumatic carditis and
vasculitis - polyarteritis nodosa, kawasaki disease and not seen in the cases of aortic dissection, is usually the result of the deposition of immune complexes and plasma proteins in the arterial wall. on biopsy, fibrinoid necrosis appears as bright pink and amorphous deposits in the vessel wall.",2313-1503.PNG,A,
Q21,A 1o-year-old boy comes with a fever and pain in his right upper limb. He has an expansile lesion in his right radius in the diaphysis. The histopathology of the lesion is shown below. what is the most accurate test among the following?,"a)t15;17 (q22 11-12)
b)RB mutation
c)EwSR1 (FUS- ETS fusion gene)
d)t11:22 (q24,q12)","This 1o-year-old boy presents with fever and pain in his right upper limb, accompanied by an
expansile lesion in the diaphysis of the radius, with the characteristic histopathology showing
uniform, round blue cells arranged in Homer-Wright rosettes is suggestive of Ewing's sarcoma.  The most accurate test to confirm this diagnosis is the detection of the EWSR1 (FUS-ETS fusion gene).
Ewing sarcoma is the 2nd most common bone sarcoma in children. The majority of the patients    affected are usually &lt;2o years of age. It has a slight male predominance. The majority of Ewing



sarcomas have a balanced translocation between the EWSR1 gene on chromosome 22 and the FLI1 gene on chromosome 11.
It commonly involves the diaphysis of the long bones like the femur, tibia, fibula, humerus, and flat bones of the pelvis. Patients present with painful enlarging mass, fever, and anaemia. The    affected area is usually tender, swollen, and warm.
Laboratory findings may show an elevated WBC count, LDH levels (lactate dehydrogenase) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The common diagnostic test used for Ewing’s sarcoma is the detection of translocation-EWSR1 (FUS-ETS fusion gene), t(11;22) (q24;q12).
Radiological examination of Ewing's sarcoma shows a destructive lesion in the diaphysis of long bones. Deposition of periosteal reaction in layers gives an onion-peel appearance.
A histopathological examination of Ewing sarcoma shows sheets of uniform, round blue cells
arranged in Homer-Wright rosettes. Immunohistochemistry is usually positive for synaptophysin and mic-2. The tumor cells contain glycogen and are hence PAS positive and they are reticulin
negative.


Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) demonstrates a positive EWSR1 gene rearrangement,     characteristic of Ewing sarcoma. In the image given below, the fused region denoted by yellow    corresponds to a normal intact gene, while a split signal pattern showing separate red and green signals is indicative of EWSR1 gene rearrangement.





preoperative chemotherapy with vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide results in
extensive tumour necrosis and shrinkage. wide excision may be combined with adjuvant
radiotherapy if surgical margins are poor. Definitive radiotherapy rather than surgical excision
may be advocated if it is non-resectable or metastasis has occurred. It is a radio-sensitive tumour.
Indicators of poor prognosis in patients with Ewing's sarcoma:
• presence of distant metastasis - worst prognostic factor
• Size and location of the primary lesion
• presence of fever, anaemia
• Leukocytosis and raised ESR.",2314-1504.PNG,C,Picture18.png
Q22,A couple comes for prenatal genetic counselling. They have a family history of Hemophilia.   They have a male child with Hemophilia and a normal female child. The mother's family has Hemophilia and the father's family is normal. what are the chances of their offspring being   affected?,"a)All males will be affected and all females will be normal
b)Half of the males can be affected and half of the females can be carriers
c)All males will be affected and half of the females will be carriers
d)All of males and females will be affected","The chances of their offspring being affected by hemophilia, an X-linked recessive disorder, are that half of the males can be affected and half of the females can be carriers.
The couple's family history reveals that the mother is likely a carrier, given her family background of hemophilia, while the father's family is unaffected. Their male child has hemophilia, indicating  he inherited the affected X chromosome from his mother. The normal female child may or may
not be a carrier, depending on whether she inherited the affected X from her mother.
X-linked recessive disorders have the following features:
• Males are affected more commonly and more severely than females.
• Female carriers have a 25% risk of having an affected son, a 25% risk for a carrier daughter, and a 5o% chance of having a child that does not inherit the mutated X-linked gene.
• The affected father will have all daughters (1oo%) to be carriers and unaffected sons because they pass their X chromosome to all of their daughters and their Y chromosome to all of their
sons.





Hemophilia B, also known as christmas disease, results from mutations in coagulation factor IX. In addition to hemophilia B, it’s important to note hemophilia A, which is caused by a deficiency  in factor VIII. Hemophilia A is also inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, presenting similar clinical features to hemophilia B, such as prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and
normal prothrombin time (PT). Both conditions require different factor assays for accurate
diagnosis, but both lead to increased bleeding risks. Treatment options, including recombinant factor infusions for both hemophilia A and B, are essential for managing the conditions and
minimizing complications.",,B,2348-1529.PNG
Q23,"A 1o-year-old boy comes with visual disturbances and a headache. on imaging, he was found  to have a suprasellar lesion. on biopsy and examination, the tumour exuded ""black motor oil"" like fluid. The MRI image is shown below. what is your likely diagnosis?","a)Glioblastoma
b)Craniopharyngioma
c)Meningioma
d)Pituitary adenoma","The given clinical scenario along with MRI showing intracranial mass with calcification at sella turcica and histopathology showing black motor oil point to a diagnosis of craniopharyngioma.
craniopharyngiomas are tumors that arise from the remnants of Rathke’s pouch. It is an
intracranial space-occupying lesion. It has a bimodal age of presentation. children usually present with frequent headaches, short stature, bitemporal hemianopsia (due to optic chiasm
compression), and polyuria.
These tumors are usually large and heterogeneous, displaying both solid and cystic components,  and occur within the suprasellar area. The cysts contain a cholesterol-rich, thick brownish-yellow fluid and are compared to machine oil. They also show radiologically demonstrable calcification.
Treatment of central diabetes insipidus caused by craniopharyngioma includes supplementation with vasopressin analogues desmopressin (DDAVP) and resection of the tumour.
other options:
option A: Glioblastoma affects people usually in the sixth or seventh decade. These tumours may arise de novo or may result from a malignant transformation of lower-grade astrocytomas.
Mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), PTEN, and epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) are implicated in the pathogenesis. The majority of the tumours (9o%) have IDH



wild-type mutation, and the remaining have IDH mutant type. Clinically, the patient presents with headaches, seizures due to raised intracranial pressure, or focal neurologic deficits, depending
upon the site involved.
Radiologically, glioblastomas appear as a large ring-enhancing heterogeneous mass with central necrosis and surrounding oedema that crosses the corpus callosum into both frontal lobes. The  image given below shows MRI findings seen in glioblastomas. Note the butterfly morphology of the tumour:


option C: Meningiomas are predominantly benign tumors, usually attached to the dura. They are predominantly seen in females and in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2, which is an
autosomal disorder associated with multiple meningiomas, schwannomas, and ependymomas.   The image below shows a well-defined, hyper-intense, and homogeneously enhanced mass close to the midline suggestive of meningioma.




option D: Pituitary adenomas are usually found in adults. The most common genetic alterations in this condition are mutations in G proteins (particularly GNAS). Depending on their size, they  are classified as microadenomas(diameter &lt; 1 cm) and macroadenomas(diameter &gt; 1 cm).    They may be functioning or non-functioning. The most common type of functioning pituitary
adenomas are prolactinomas. The brain MRI showing a pituitary adenoma is given below:",2315-1505.PNG,B,2349-1531.PNG;2349-1530.PNG;2350-1532.PNG
Q24,which protein accumulation is seen in Alzheimer's disease?,"a)Alpha synuclein
b)Aβ amyloid
c)GFAP
d)Albumin","Aβ amyloid deposition is seen in Alzheimer's disease.
Aβ constitutes the core of cerebral plaques found in Alzheimer's disease. It also gets deposited in the walls of cerebral blood vessels. The Aβ protein is derived by proteolysis from a much larger    transmembrane glycoprotein, called amyloid precursor protein (APP).
other options
option A: Alpha-synuclein is an unfolded protein that aggregates in Lewy Body Dementia,   particularly in the subcortical regions and in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus.
option C: GFAP is the marker for glial origin tumors like glioblastoma, and oligodendroglioma.
option D: Albumin levels may rise during fasting and diarrhoea.",,B,
Q25,which method is more effective than measuring clotting factors for assessing the intrinsic pathway of coagulation?,"a)PT
b)APTT
c)Fibrinogen levels
d)CBC","Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is more effective than measuring clotting factors for assessing the intrinsic pathway, i.e. factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, V, II, and fibrinogen.
Causes of prolonged APTT:
• Disseminated intravascular coagulation
• Liver disease



• Massive transfusion with plasma-depleted red blood cells
• Administration of or contamination with heparin or other anticoagulants
• A circulating anticoagulant (inhibitor)
• Deficiency of a coagulation factor other than factor VII (since it is part of the extrinsic pathway)
• APTT is also moderately prolonged in patients taking oral anticoagulant drugs and in the presence of vitamin K deficiency
APTT is also moderately prolonged in patients taking oral anticoagulant drugs and in the presence of vitamin K deficiency (in which factors II, VII, IX, and X will fail to activate). A patient with
previously undiagnosed haemophilia or another congenital coagulation disorder can also present with an isolated prolonged APTT.
other options:
option A: Prothrombin time evaluates the extrinsic pathway, i.e. factors VII, X, V, II
(prothrombin), and fibrinogen. It measures the clotting time of plasma in the presence of an optimal concentration of tissue extract (thromboplastin).
Causes of prolonged PT:
• Administration of oral anticoagulant drugs (vitamin K antagonists)
• Liver disease, particularly obstructive jaundice
• Vitamin K deficiency
• Disseminated intravascular coagulation
• Rarely, a previously undiagnosed factor VII, X, V or prothrombin deficiency or defect  Isolated prolonged prothrombin time occurs due to the deficiency of clotting factor VII. option C: Fibrinogen levels are used for measuring clotting.
option D: Complete blood count is used to measure total RBC count, WBC count, and Platelet count.",,B,
Q26,"An adult male presented with protruding abdomen, diarrhoea, visual symptoms and  neurological manifestations. Based on the peripheral smear finding what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Burns
b)Abetalipoproteinemia
c)uremia
d)EDTA changes","The given clinical scenario along with the peripheral smear showing acanthocytosis is suggestive of abetalipoproteinemia.
Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare autosomal recessive disease. It is caused due to the mutation in
microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP). MTTP is necessary to transfer lipids to nascent  chylomicrons in the small intestine and to VLDL in the liver. In abetalipoproteinemia, there is an absence of chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL (apoB containing lipoproteins), and deficient levels of
plasma cholesterol and triglycerides.





In abetalipoproteinemia, the usual presentation is fat malabsorption, diarrhea, and failure to
thrive in early childhood. vitamin E deficiency secondary to abetalipoproteinemia can lead to
spinocerebellar degeneration. It manifests as loss of deep tendon reflexes, progressive ataxia, and lower limb spasticity by adulthood.
Intestinal biopsy shows lipid-laden vacuolated epithelium due to triglyceride accumulation.
Accumulated lipids disappear after infants stop taking feed. Early treatment with supplemental  vitamins, especially vitamin E, may significantly slow the development of neurological sequelae.
Acanthocytes (spur cells) are spiculated red cells with a few projections of varying size and uneven surface distribution. The image below shows acanthocytes in the peripheral smear.


other options:
option A: Burns patient's peripheral smear will show spherocytes due to direct physical or chemical injury to the cells. The image below shows spherocytes.





option C: uremia patients present with nausea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, muscle cramps, pruritus, mental status changes, visual disturbances, increased thirst, and peripheral
smear will show burr cells/echinocytes due to anemia. Echinocyte or Burr cells are characterized by projections of the red cell membrane that are smaller, regularly spaced, smoothly rounded
crenulations, and much more uniform in shape and distribution in contrast to the acanthocytes.


option D: Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) changes include structural, biochemical and functional damage to platelets. It also causes irreversible dissociation of the fibrinogen receptor, glycoprotein alpha IIb beta 3 (GPIIb/IIIa).",2316-1506.PNG,B,2352-1534.PNG;2352-1533.PNG;Picture15.png
Q27,which among the following statements is true regarding PNH?,"a)Anemia with heart failure is the most common cause of mortality b) It is an inherited condition
b)sucrose lysis test is diagnostic
c)Flow cytometry is the gold standard for diagnosis","Flow cytometry is the gold standard for diagnosis and is the correct statement regarding PNH. It  provides a sensitive means for detecting red cells that are deficient in GPI-linked proteins such as CD59.
Investigations in PNH include:
• Flow cytometry (gold standard) - deficiency of CD59 and CD55
• Ham test (acidified serum lysis) - lysis of RBCs in a mildly acidic pH due to complement fixation
• Bone marrow biopsy -
• Hypercellularity with erythroid hyperplasia is seen in classical presentations
• Patients who develop pancytopenia will have hypocellular bone marrow
• Imaging - to evaluate venous thrombosis
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is due to acquired mutations in the
phosphatidylinositol glycan A gene (PIGA), leading to a deficiency of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteins. Blood cells are deficient in three GPI-linked proteins that regulate
complement activity making them susceptible to lysis or injury by complement. These are a
decay-accelerating factor or CD55, membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis or CD59 (most important), and C8-binding protein.
Clinical features in paroxysmal intravascular hemolysis occur nocturnally in 25% of cases.
Clinically, the patient would have hemolysis, pancytopenia, and a tendency for venous
thrombosis. Intravascular hemolysis may be nocturnal and paroxysmal or chronic hemolysis without the dramatic hemoglobinuria. some patients may complain of recurrent attacks of    abdominal pain that may be related to thrombosis in abdominal veins.
other options:
option A: Thrombosis is the most common cause of death in persons with PNH and not anaemia with heart failure.
option B: It is an acquired condition and not an inherited condition.
option C: sucrose lysis test is used for screening of PNH.",,D,
Q28,"A patient presented with an arm span of more than height, a subluxated lens, and a pigeon chest appearance. what is the likely protein involved in this condition?","a)Fibrillin
b)collagen
c)Elastin
d)Laminin","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of Marfan's syndrome and the likely protein involved in this condition is fibrillin.
Marfan's syndrome is an inherited connective tissue disorder that is caused by a mutation in a
gene that codes for an extracellular matrix protein-fibrillin-1 (FBN1). The FBN1 locus is on the
long arm of chromosome 15. It is a clinical diagnosis based on skeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular manifestations.
skeletal manifestations:
• overgrowth of long bones (dolichostenomelia) with an arm span to height ratio of more than
1.o5
• Pectus carinatum or pectus excavatum



• Long and slender fingers (arachnodactyly), contracture of fingers (camptodactyly)
• Malar hypoplasia
• Joint laxity
cardiovascular manifestations:
• Thickened atrioventricular valves, valvular prolapse (mitral regurgitation)
• Aortic valve dysfunction due to aortic root aneurysm
• Aortic dissection and rupture due to cystic medial necrosis of the aorta ocular manifestations:
• ectopia lentis
• myopia

Image (a) shows walker-Murdoch (wrist) sign - the ability to join the thumb and fifth finger
around the wrist. Image (b) shows steinberg (thumb) sign - thumb tip extends from the palm of the hand in a closed fist


Diagnosis is based on criteria depending on the family history, aortic root X score, ectopia lentis, mitral valve prolapse, and presence of FBN1 mutation.



Homocystinuria can be one of the differential diagnoses for this condition. It is an inborn error of methionine metabolism caused by a deficiency of the enzyme cystathionine β-synthase. It is
characterized by tall stature, long limbs, dislocation of the lens of the eye, and predisposition to thromboembolism, but it does not lead to black urine.
other options:
option B: collagen is a connective tissue. Defects in collagen lead to conditions like osteogenesis imperfecta, stickler syndrome, Ehler-Danlos syndrome, and Alport syndrome.
option c: Elastin is a crucial protein found in connective tissue predominantly located in
ligaments and the walls of blood vessels, especially large arteries like the aorta.  The maturation of elastin involves the formation of desmosine cross-links from four lysine residues, contributing to    its stability and low turnover rate. williams-Beuren syndrome is an associated developmental
disorder (deletions of the elastin gene) affecting connective tissue and the central nervous system. Fragmentation or a decrease of elastin is found in conditions such as pulmonary emphysema,
cutis laxa, and ageing of the skin. copper deficiency can also affect the formation of crucial cross-linking in elastin.

d)Epidermoid carcinoma","The clinical history along with histology showing palisade in a spoke-and-wheel arrangement, surrounding a central core(Flexner wintersteiner rosettes) and the lesion being positive for     synaptophysin, NSE, and chromogranin is suggestive of retinoblastoma.
Retinoblastoma is a malignant proliferation of immature retinal neural cells and is the most
common intraocular malignancy in children. It is associated with mutations in the RB1 gene at chromosome 13q14. It is a tumor of a group called small round blue cell tumors because the
immature retinal neural cells are seen as small round cells with large nuclei.
white pupillary reflex or leukocoria is the most common presenting feature, followed by a squint
which is usually convergent. Rarely, the child may present with nystagmus and defective vision. Image showing leukocoria of left eye.





Histopathology of the tumor shows small round cells with large nuclei. Microscopic features of a well-differentiated tumor include Flexner-wintersteiner rosettes (highly specific of
retinoblastoma), Homer-wright rosettes, pseudorosettes, and fleurettes formation. Areas of necrosis and calcification can also be seen.
The histopathological image of retinoblastoma is shown below.


Treatment typically involves chemotherapy plus focal therapy. The commonly used three-drug    regimen is the CVE regimen consisting of vincristine, carboplatin, and etoposide. Focal therapy  includes cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation, thermotherapy, plaque radiotherapy, and external beam radiotherapy. Enucleation is done when:
• the tumor involves more than half of the retina
• the optic nerve is involved
• glaucoma is present and the anterior chamber is involved



In the stage of extraocular extension, the globe bursts through the sclera, usually near the limbus or the optic disc. This is followed by rapid fungation and involvement of extraocular tissues
resulting in marked proptosis. Distant metastasis occurs through the lymphatic spread and the direct extension by continuity to the optic nerve and brain.
other options:
option B: Medulloblastoma is a malignant embryonal tumor of childhood that occurs exclusively in the cerebellum. patients usually present with headaches, ataxia, and signs of brainstem
involvement.
Histologically, the tumor is very densely cellular. Individual tumor cells have scant cytoplasm
and elongated or crescent-shaped hyperchromatic nuclei. Tumor cells form Homer Wright rosettes. They express neuronal markers such as synaptophysin.


option C: pineoblastomas are tumours in the pineal region that are best described as small,
round, blue-cell tumours. They closely resemble medulloblastomas and retinoblastomas. They are regarded as WHo grade 4 tumours and are the most aggressive and high-grade tumour among
pineal parenchymal tumours. The below image shows tightly packed small round blue cells (high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio).





option D: Epidermoid carcinoma arises from ectodermal cells misplaced during the closure of the neural tube in the process of embryogenesis. There is an accumulation of keratin and cholesterol   which gives the tumours their pearly or milky white appearance. A substantial region of keratin is encased in a thin layer of epithelial cells on the outside of an epidermoid tumour. Fatty acids and  keratin are found inside the tumour, while stratified squamous epithelium, or normal skin cells,    make up the outside of the growth.",,A,2357-1538.PNG;2357-1537.PNG

imaging, he was found to have diffuse interstitial fibrosis. The biopsy of his lung was taken  and is shown below. which of the following industries he has likely been working in for the last 2o years?","a)Asbestos
b)silica
c)Coal
d)Beryllium","This clinical scenario and image showing typical asbestos bodies are suggestive of that he has been likely to be working in the asbestos industry for 2o years.
Asbestosis is a type of pneumoconiosis associated with asbestos exposure. The disease-causing
capabilities of the different forms of asbestos depend on concentration, size, shape, and solubility. This condition is marked by diffuse pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. Asbestos bodies are a typical     finding. They are golden brown, fusiform, or beaded rods with a translucent center. They consist   of asbestos fibers coated with an iron-containing proteinaceous material and arise when these
fibers are phagocytosed by macrophages.
The image below shows asbestos bodies.





Asbestos occurs in two distinct forms - serpentine chrysotile (more common) and amphibole (more pathogenic). Exposure may result in the following conditions:
• Localized fibrous plaques or, rarely, diffuse pleural fibrosis
• pleural effusions
• parenchymal interstitial fibrosis (asbestosis)
• Lung carcinoma
• Mesotheliomas
• Extrapulmonary neoplasms including laryngeal, ovarian, and colon carcinomas other options
option B: silicosis is an occupational disease caused by exposure to silica or crystalline quartz. It is seen in people who work in mining, stone cutting, sandblasting, and quarrying. silicosis
presents as small rounded opacities in the upper lobe. There may be calcification of hilar lymph nodes which leads to the appearance of eggshell calcification. HRCT will show a characteristic    crazy paving pattern due to interlobular septal thickening on the background of ground-glass
opacity.
option C: Anthracosis/coal workers' pneumoconiosis is a pulmonary condition seen in coal
miners. The inhaled carbon pigment is engulfed by alveolar or interstitial macrophages, which   accumulate in the connective tissue. on prolonged exposure, lung tissue undergoes progressive massive fibrosis, which is called complicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis. The upper lobes of the lungs are commonly involved.
option D: Berylliosis is an occupational disease due to chronic exposure to beryllium. It is seen in people who work on processing alloys for high-tech industries like aerospace industries. Chest
radiography shows nodules along the septal lines with hilar and mediastinal lymph node
enlargement. HRCT will show pulmonary nodules, diffuse interstitial fibrosis, and interlobular septal thickening.",Picture13.png,A,2360-1541.PNG
Q31,"A 45 year old woman came with complaints of fever, night sweats, generalised itching and unintentional weight loss of 1o% in the last 3 months. on examination, she has enlarged   cervical and axillary lymph nodes. The lymph node examination and biopsy showed the
following picture. what would the likely diagnosis and treatment option be?","a)Non Hodgkins Lymphoma - Rituximab monotherapy
b)Non Hogkins Lymphoma - poor prognosis due to advanced stage - treated with radiotherapy
c)Hodgkins Lymphoma - ABVD regimen
d)sarcoidiosis - started on prednisolone 4o mg/day","The clinical vignette with the lymph node biopsy showing a classical Reed-sternberg cell is
suggestive of a diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma and an ABVD regimen (Doxorubicin (Adriamycin), Bleomycin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine) is used for the treatment.
The Reed sternberg cell is a giant cell. It has a classic owl-eyed appearance due to the presence of a symmetric or mirror-image bilobed nucleus with prominent nucleoli surrounded by a clear
space.


Hodgkin's lymphoma -
• It is of B-cell origin
• It has a bimodal distribution of age at diagnosis, with one incidence in young adults in their twenties and another incidence in older patients in their eighties.
• Typical presentation involves lymphadenopathy/mass with B symptoms which include fever, night sweats, and weight loss
• HIV infection is a risk factor. Another virus that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
Hodgkin's lymphoma is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Further EBV can be detected in almost all cases of HIV-associated Hodgkin's lymphoma.
• Majority of the patients can be treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy or chemotherapy
alone. The most widely used chemotherapy regimen in Hodgkin's lymphoma is the ABVD regimen (Doxorubicin (Adriamycin), Bleomycin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine).
other options
option A and C:  R-CHoP (Rituximab + Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine (oncovin), and Prednisone) regimen is used in the treatment of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
option D: sarcoidosis is a granulomatous inflammatory condition with multisystem involvement. The most common organs affected are the lungs, liver, eyes, and skin. The most widely accepted   etiological hypothesis is an inflammatory response to an infectious or non-infectious trigger in a   susceptible host.",2318-1507.PNG,C,2361-1542.PNG
Q32,"A 28 year old woman p1L1, came with complaints of weakness and generalised fatigue. The peripheral blood picture showed microcytic hypochromic anemia. Her serum iron was low   and she had increased RDw. Her MCV and MCH were also low and TIBC was high. what   would her serum transferrin saturation be?","a)Reduced
b)Cannot be determined
c)Equivocal
d)Increased","The clinical scenario along with lab investigations showing microcytic hypochromic anemia is suggestive of iron deficiency anemia. Transferrin saturation is decreased in iron deficiency
anemia.
clinical presentation may include fatigue, pallor, reduced exercise capacity. cheilosis (fissures at the corners of the mouth) and koilonychia (spooning of the fingernails) are signs of advanced
tissue iron deficiency.
Laboratory findings are:
• Reduced hemoglobin and hematocrit values.
• hypochromia, microcytosis, and poikilocytosis.
• serum iron and ferritin levels are low.
• The total plasma iron-binding capacity that reflects the elevated transferrin levels is high.
• Low serum iron with increased iron-binding capacity results in a reduction of transferrin saturation to below 15%.
• RBc protoporphyrin levels are increased. protoporphyrin is an intermediate in the heme  synthesis pathway. under conditions in which heme synthesis is impaired, protoporphyrin accumulates within the red cell.
• Bone marrow reveals a mild to moderate increase in erythroid progenitors. The absence of stainable iron in macrophages is a diagnostically significant finding.

Q33,"A 38-year-old woman came with complaints of weakness, lethargy, and heavy menstrual
bleeding. Her peripheral blood picture showed small RBCs with pallor. Lab investigations are given below. what is the diagnosis?","a)Megaloblastic anemia
b)Iron-deficiency anemia
c)Hemolytic anemia
d)Hypoplastic anemia","The given clinical profile of a woman with low hemoglobin, MCV, MCH, transferrin saturation, and high TIBC suggests a diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA).
IDA is an example of microcytic hypochromic anemia. The causes of IDA can be inadequate diet, impaired reabsorption, increased requirement and increased blood loss.
The manifestations of IDA depend upon the underlying cause. In general, IDA presents with     koilonychia, alopecia, atrophic changes in the tongue, gastric mucosa, malabsorption, and pica (craving for consumption of non-edible materials)
peripheral smears show small, pale red cells typically described as microcytic (reduced MCV) and hypochromic (enlarged zone of central pallor). poikilocytosis can be seen as elongated red cells,    known as pencil cells. Target cells can be found in cases of severe IDA.
Diagnosis is mainly by laboratory studies. The typical findings are:
• Low hemoglobin and hematocrit
• Low serum iron and ferritin
• Increased Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC)
• Hepcidin is low (decreased stores of iron inhibit hepcidin synthesis)
IDA is treated by giving oral and parenteral preparations if iron or packed cell transfusion, depending on the anemia's severity.
other options:
option A: Megaloblastic anemia is defined by a high MCV
option C: Hemolytic anaemia causes the body to produce more erythropoietin, which in turn causes erythroid differentiation and the marrow to produce more erythroid precursors or
normoblasts. A noticeable reticulocytosis in the peripheral blood is the consequence of



compensatory increases in erythropoiesis. Hemosiderin, an iron-containing pigment, accumulates as a result of red cell phagocytosis, especially in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow.
option D: Hypoplastic anaemia will have markedly hypocellular marrow. Aplastic anaemia is one of the most important examples. Marrow aspirate will show a dry tap.",,B,
