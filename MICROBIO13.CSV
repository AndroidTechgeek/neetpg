Q1,"A microorganism is resistant to meropenem and aminoglycoside and sensitive to ticarcillin-clavulanate, and cotrimoxazole. what is the likely microorganism?","a)stenotrophomonas maltophila
b)Burkholderia cepacia
c)pseudomonas aeruginosa
d)Acinetobacter baumannii","stenotrophomonas maltophila, formerly called pseudomonas maltophila, is an opportunistic    pathogen that causes wound infection, urinary tract infection, and septicemia. It is sensitive to cotrimoxazole.
Intrinsic resistance is the innate ability of a bacterial species to resist the activity of a particular antimicrobial agent through its inherent structural or functional characteristics, which allow
tolerance of a particular drug or antimicrobial class.
Burkholderia cepacia, formerly called pseudomonas cepacia, is an opportunistic pathogen that causes fatal necrotizing pneumonia. B. cepacia complex strains are intrinsically resistant to
aminoglycosides, polymyxin, and first and second-generation cephalosporins but sensitive to meropenem, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, minocycline, chloramphenicol and ceftazidime.",,A,
Q2,"A patient with a history of bone marrow transplant presented with a lesion in the lung. on microscopic examination, the lesion is shown below. what is the likely causative agent?","a)Histoplasmosis
b)cryptococcosis
c)Mucormycosis
d)Aspergillosis","The given clinical scenario of lung lesion and the image showing septate hyphae with branching at acute angles is suggestive of aspergillosis.
Invasive aspergillosis occurs due to infection with Aspergillus species. It is often seen in
immunocompromised patients. Most cases of invasive aspergillosis involve the lungs. The clinical features include fever, cough which may be productive, chest discomfort, hemoptysis, and
shortness of breath. voriconazole is the drug of choice.
other manifestations include allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis where central
bronchiectasis is usually seen. Aspergilloma and superficial infections like otomycosis or mycotic keratitis are the other presentations.



Histopathological examination of the tissue section shows characteristic dichotomous
branching at an acute angle. The hyphae stain poorly with hematoxylin and eosin, so periodic acid–schiff (pAs) stain is used.
other methods for diagnosis include detection of galactomannan (Aspergillus cell-wall component) and culture isolation. Aspergillus fumigatus grows dark green colonies,
while Aspergillus niger appears black. yellow-green colonies are seen in case of Aspergillus flavus. Microscopic examination of colonies stained with lactophenol cotton blue would show septate
hyphae and conidiophores.",1671-1066.PNG,D,
Q3,Identify the organism in the given image.,"a)Aspergillus
b)Mucor
c)Talaromyces
d)Blastomyces","Microscopy showing broad, aseptate, ribbon-like hyphae with irregular branching is suggestive of mucor.
Mucormycosis/ zygomycosis is an opportunistic infection caused principally by species of
rhizopus (most prevalent), mucor, and absidia. The common clinical form is rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis in which there is an invasion of the blood vessels in the nasal cavity, eyes, and
brain causing thrombosis, infarction, and necrosis. The blackish discoloration is due to arterial and venous thrombosis leading to gangrene.
Diagnosis can be made by staining them with 1o% potassium hydroxide and culture. on
sabouraud agar at 3o-37°c, they appear as grey-white colonies with a thick cottony, fluffy surface. under the microscope, they appear as irregularly branched broad hyphae with aerial
sporangiophores which end in a sac containing spores called sporangium.
other options:
options A and c: Aspergillus and Talaromyces (previously known as penicillium) both
demonstrate septate hyphae with conidiophores.
option D: Blastomyces is a dimorphic fungus that exists in the yeast form in body tissues and cultures maintained at 37°c and in the filamentous mold form in cultures at room
temperature (25°c). In the yeast form, it shows thick-walled round yeast cells with single broad-based budding, giving a figure of 8 appearance.",1672-1067.PNG,B,
Q4,"A pregnant woman comes for an antenatal check-up. she has a history of stillbirth at 28 weeks in her previous pregnancy. she also has a history of multiple sexual partners and
vaguely remembers having a painless ulcer on her vulva prior to her last pregnancy. what would be the first step of investigation for this lady?","a)HIV ELIsA
b)VDRL
c)Dark ground microscopy
d)culture","Venereal disease research laboratory test (VDRL test) is the first investigation in this patient with a history of stillbirth and painless genital ulcer, which is likely suggestive of syphilis.
syphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum, a spirochete that is actively motile. It exhibits characteristic corkscrew-like motility.
primary syphilis occurs subsequent to inoculation of treponema pallidum following sexual
contact. It manifests as a painless, non-tender, single papule over the genitalia, that rapidly
becomes eroded and usually becomes indurated, and is called a hard chancre. It can be
accompanied by lymphadenopathy. The chancre generally heals within 1o-4o days even without treatment, leaving a scar.



The obstetric history in an untreated syphilitic woman typically gets better with subsequent pregnancies. Initial few pregnancies can result in abortions and stillbirths, subsequent
pregnancies can result in live births of infants with stigmata of syphilis. Finally, after a few pregnancies, healthy infants are born.
It can be diagnosed using VDRL, and RPR tests. It can be confirmed by FTA – ABS testing or TPHA, TPI testing.
Dark ground microscopy is the most specific and sensitive technique to diagnose syphilis when an active chancre or condyloma lata is present. Since the ulcer is not active in this patient, it is not
useful in this scenario.
Smear specimens can be stained using Fontana stain and pathological tissues are stained using Levaditi stain. Silver impregnation technique can also be used.",,B,
Q5,Match the diseases with their maximum incubation period.,"a)1-a, 2-b, 3-c, 4-d
b)1-d, 2-c, 3-b, 4-a
c)1-d, 2-c, 3-a, 4-b
d)1-b, 2-a, 3-d, 4-c","The correct match is:
The incubation period is the time interval between the invasion of the infectious agent and the appearance of the first symptom or signs in the body.
The incubation period of syphilis is 1o-9o days and varies inversely with the size of the
Spirochaete inoculum.
The incubation period of SARS infection ranges from 5 to 1o days.
The incubation period of Hepatitis A infection ranges from 1o to 5o days (usually 14-28 days).
chickenpox is caused by varicella zoster virus (HSV-3). The incubation period is between 1o to 21 days.

Q6,"A cSF sample of an elderly male presenting with meningitis is subjected to gram staining and revealed gram-positive bacilli. which of the following is true regarding the motility of the
causative agent?","a)Motile at 22°c and 37°c
b)Motile at 37°c, non motile at 22°c
c)Motile at 25°c, non motile at 37°c
d)Nonmotile at 22°c and 37°c","The given scenario of an elderly male with meningitis and smear showing gram-positive bacillus is suggestive of Listeria infection. Listeria is motile at 25°c and non-motile at 37°c.



Listeria exhibits a characteristic slow tumbling end-over-end motility at 22–28°c but is
non-motile at 37°c. This is because the peritrichous flagella are produced by the bacillus optimally between 2o°c and 3o°c. This is known as differential motility as the motility pattern changes with a change in temperature.
Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive bacillus. It can survive at refrigerator temperatures
(4°c), under conditions of low pH and high salt. so it is able to overcome food preservation and safety barriers, making it an important foodborne pathogen. The virulence factor produced
by Listeria is called listeriolysin o. This helps the bacteria to escape and causes septicemia. They are catalase-positive, will not produce H2s, and shows beta hemolysis. This helps to
differentiate Listeria from other gram-positive bacilli.
L. monocytogenes enters the body after ingestion of contaminated foods such as refrigerated milk, cheese, fruit, or vegetables. Healthy persons exposed to L. monocytogenes in food may develop
mild, self-limiting febrile gastroenteritis lasting 1–3 days. This develops after an incubation period of 6–48 hours. symptoms include fever, chills, headache, myalgias, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.",,C,1688-1075.PNG
Q7,"which of the following is a protozoan parasite, that can be seen inside kupffer cells?","a)Toxoplasma
b)Leishmania donovani
c)Babesia
d)plasmodium vivax","The protozoan parasite, that can be seen inside kupffer cells is Leishmania donovani.
kupffer cells are a component of the mononuclear phagocytic system found in the liver. The     amastigote form of leishmania also known as the Leishman-Donovan (LD) body (shown in the image below) is an intracellular form found inside macrophages, monocytes, and other
reticuloendothelial cells. It contains a kinetoplast, which consists of a parabasal body and a blepharoplast. Flagellum is absent.





Leishmaniasis is a slowly progressing indigenous disease caused by a protozoan parasite of the genus Leishmania.
The life cycle of Leishmania involves two forms:
• The promastigote develops and lives extracellularly in the sandfly vector, and
• The amastigote multiplies intracellularly in the reticuloendothelial cells of the host
It is transmitted by the bite of an infected female phlebotomus sandfly which inoculates the
flagellated promastigotes into the skin of the host. This condition causes fever with rigor and   chills associated with splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. It lowers immunity, causes persistent   fever, anemia, and liver and spleen enlargement, and if left untreated, death may occur due to opportunistic infection.
Diagnosis of leishmaniasis is mainly by demonstration of amastigotes within macrophages in
tissue aspirates such as blood smears, bone marrow, splenic, or lymph node aspirate. It is the gold standard for diagnosis.",,B,1689-1076.PNG
Q8,which of the following organism is transmitted by the vector shown in the image below?,"a)orientia tsutsugamushi
b)kyasanur forest disease
c)chandipura virus
d)Anaplasma","The image shows the trombiculid mite which is responsible for the transmission of orientia tsutsugamushi.
scrub typhus, also known as chigger-borne typhus, is caused by orientia tsutsugamushi. The
vector is trombiculid mite. Humans are infected when they are bitten by the mite larvae known
as chiggers. The incubation period is 1- 3 weeks. patients develop a characteristic eschar at the site of the mite bite, along with regional lymphadenopathy and maculopapular rash. It can be
associated with fever, headache, and conjunctival injection. Meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, and pneumonia can be seen in severe cases.
serologic assays are used for diagnosis. weil-Felix reaction is a heterophile agglutination reaction used for diagnosis, wherein the sera are tested for agglutinins to the o antigens of certain proteus strains ox19, ox2, and oxk. oxk is agglutinated only in scrub typhus. Doxycycline is the



treatment of choice for both adults and children.",1674-1068.PNG,A,
Q9,A lady cleans her cat litter regularly to avoid infection by toxoplasma during her pregnancy. what is the infective stage of this organism in the cat feces?,"a)Bradyzoites
b)Tissue cysts
c)Tachyzoites
d)oocysts","The infective stage of Toxoplasma found in the cat feces is oocysts.
The oocysts develop from the sexual reproduction ofToxoplasma in the gut lumen of the cat and pass out via the feces. It takes 1 to 5 days for the oocysts to become infective after being excreted in the feces. Hence, daily removal of cat litter and safe disposal can prevent infection.
Both asexual reproduction (schizogony) and sexual reproduction (gametogony) occur within definitive hosts such as cats. The tachyzoites and tissue cysts represent stages in asexual
multiplication, while the oocyst is formed by sexual reproduction, which occurs only in the definitive hosts such as cats.
only the asexual forms i.e., tachyzoites, and tissue cysts are present in intermediate hosts such as humans, mice, rats, etc.






Humans acquire the infection upon consumption of meat containing tissue cysts, food or water containing mature oocysts, or fingers contaminated by cat feces.
Manifestations are mostly asymptomatic and if symptomatic can be congenital or acquired.
Features such as fever, headache, myalgia, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy commonly affect the cervical lymph nodes.
central nervous system involvement is observed in toxoplasma infection affecting
immunocompromised individuals. Toxoplasma infection in pregnancy can lead to congenital toxoplasmosis that most frequently presents with chorioretinitis.",,D,1690-1077.PNG;1691-1078.PNG
Q10,which of the following is a false statement according to the cDc classification of bioterrorism agents?,"a)category A - Easily transmitted and are associated with high mortality rates
b)category D - Re-emerging diseases that are high priority agents
c)category c - Emerging diseases that are easy to disseminate and are associated with high mortality rates
d)category B - Moderately easy to disseminate and are associated with low mortality rates","According to cDc, the agents of bioterrorism are classified only into 3 categories (category A, B, and c), there is no category D.
Bioterrorism is the intentional release or threat of release of biological agents (i.e. viruses,
bacteria, fungi, or their toxins) in order to cause disease or death among the human population or food crops and livestock to terrorize a civilian population or manipulate the government.
The agents of bioterrorism are classified into 3 categories:
category A bioterrorism agents are those which are easily transmitted from one person to the other and are associated with high mortality rates and thus have the potential to cause major  public health impacts.
category B bioterrorism agents are those which are moderately easy to disseminate and are associated with moderate morbidity and low mortality rates.
category c bioterrorism agents are those which are emerging pathogens such as Nipah and Hantavirus, that could be engineered for mass dissemination in the future due to ease of
availability, high mortality and morbidity rates, and ease of production and dissemination.",,B,
Q11,The given image of the cell wall belongs to which of the following organism?,"a)staphylococcus aureus
b)Escherichia coli
c)Neisseria meningitides
d)Pseudomonas aeruginosa","The image showing a cell wall with a capsule and lipooligosaccharides (LOS) is suggestive of Neisseria meningitidis.
unlike lipopolysaccharide (LpS), LOS does not have a long O-antigen side chain. It is an important virulence factor and is found in a few organisms such as N. gonorrhoeae, N.
meningitidis, H. ducreyi, etc.
The genus Neisseria consists of Gram-negative, aerobic, non-sporulating, non-motile,
oxidase-positive cocci arranged typically in pairs (diplococci). It includes two pathogens, Neisseria meningitidis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The important difference is the presence of a
capsule in N. meningitidis.",1675-1069.PNG,C,
Q12,"A patient presents with Puo. He is suspected to be suffering from brucellosis. Multiple
dilutions of his serum sample are put up for a standard agglutination test. The results came as follows: Negative agglutination for the serum dilutions 1:2o and 1:4o; But 1:8o and 1:16o  were positive for agglutination. which of the following is responsible for the negative test in the first 2 dilutions?","a)Incorrect antigen
b)Incorrect antibody
c)Antibody excess
d)Antigen excess","The negative test in the first 2 tubes is due to the prozone phenomenon. Here, antibodies are in excess compared to antigens leading to weak or absent precipitation.
The lattice hypothesis explains precipitation reactions and agglutination reactions. The amount of
precipitate formed is greatly influenced by the relative proportions of antigens and
antibodies. precipitation occurs when a lattice consisting of alternating antigen and antibody molecules is formed.
• The prozone phenomenon is caused by excessive antibodies in the test system. There is weak/absent precipitation, giving a false-negative test.
• In the zone of equivalence, antigen and antibody are in optimum proportions and maximum precipitation occurs. Lattice formation is enhanced.
• post-zone phenomenon is due to the presence of excessive antigens in the test system. There is weaker/absent precipitation.
prozone phenomenon and post-zone phenomenon can give rise to false-negative
results in precipitation reactions. This can be overcome by making serial dilutions of serum, thereby optimizing the concentrations of antigens and antibodies in the test system.",,C,1693-1079.PNG
Q13,A patient presented with a lesion on the left buttock. He has a history of heart transplant 15 years back. Aspirate from the lesion shows gram-positive filamentous bacteria. what is the   likely causative agent?,"a)Nocardia
b)Bacillus anthracis
c)Mycobacterium leprae
d)Mycobacterium tuberculosis","The given clinical scenario of local abscess and aspirate showing filamentous gram-positive bacteria are suggestive of Nocardia.
Nocardia species appear as filamentous organisms with extensive hyphae-like branching. They are aerobic, gram-positive, catalase-positive, and urease positive. They are weakly acid-fast because
they stain with carbolfuchsin and retain when decolorized with 1–4% sulfuric acid instead of the stronger acid-alcohol decolorant.
Infections caused by Nocardia include cutaneous, subcutaneous, or systemic lesions. It may lead  to local abscesses, cellulitis, or lymphocutaneous lesions. systemic nocardiosis occurs more often in immunodeficient persons.
systemic nocardiosis usually caused by N.asteroides manifests primarily as pulmonary disease,
pneumonia, lung abscess, or other lesions resembling tuberculosis. Extrapulmonary manifestation may involve the brain, kidneys, and other organs.

Q14,"An elderly male patient who underwent a kidney transplant 1o years back is on
immunosuppressive therapy. He gives a history of cough and dyspnea for the past 1 week, and the sputum microscopy shows gram-positive budding yeasts cells and pseudohyphae. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Invasive mucormycosis
b)Invasive aspergillosis
c)Invasive candidiasis
d)Information is not enough for the diagnosis","cough and dyspnea in an immunosuppressed patient with microscopy showing gram-positive budding yeasts cells and pseudohyphae suggest a diagnosis of invasive candidiasis.
candida is the most common cause of opportunistic mycoses in the world. Immunocompromised individuals are at an increased risk of systemic candidiasis. The most common species implicated in candidal infections are c. albicans, c. parapsilosis, and c. glabrata. Morphologically, they are    yeast-like fungi. They exist as yeast and pseudohyphae (image below). It appears as budding
gram-positive cells on wet films and smears. Mycelial forms suggest colonization. candida albicans form chlamydospores on corn meal agar.


when colonies of candida albicans are inoculated in serum at 37°c, the yeast cells form
elongations called germ tubes within 2 hours. The image below shows germ tube formation, also



known as the Reynolds Braude phenomenon.


clinically, infection with candida spp. can present as cutaneous and mucosal candidiasis,
systemic candidiasis, or rarely, as chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. Mucocutaneous infections manifest as thrush affecting the tongue, lips, gums, and palate. It is seen as a patchy to confluent whitish pseudomembranous lesion and is commonly associated with AIDS. candida may also
invade the vaginal mucosa, leading to vulvovaginitis, and the nails and nail plate, leading to
onychomycosis. Systemic candidiasis occurs when candida enters the bloodstream. It can
manifest as kidney infections, urinary tract infections, infective endocarditis, arthritis, meningitis, endophthalmitis etc.",,C,1694-1080.PNG;1695-1081.PNG
Q15,The toxin produced by which of the following organisms acts by the mechanism shown in the image below?,"a)vibrio cholerae
b)corynebacterium diphtheriae
c)Bacillus anthracis
d)Shigella","The above image depicts the inactivation of elongation factor-2 which is the mechanism of action of diphtheria toxin.
corynebacterium diptheriae produces the diphtheria toxin, which is an AB subunit toxin. while
the B subunit helps in attachment to cell surface receptors, the A subunit causes ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor-2 (EF-2) resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis.





The exotoxin A produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, also an AB subunit toxin, acts by the same mechanism to cause inhibition of protein synthesis.
This infection presents as fever and sore throat, which progresses to dyspnea due to obstruction by the pseudomembrane. Bull's neck appearance is seen due to cervical lymphadenitis.
complications like damage to the heart (myocarditis), kidney (tubular necrosis), liver, and adrenal glands can develop due to the toxin.
other options:
option A: cholera toxin is an enterotoxin produced by vibrio cholerae. It is an AB subunit toxin where the B subunit binds to GM1 ganglioside receptors on the surface of jejunal epithelial cells. The A subunit is internalized and causes prolonged activation of adenylate cyclase resulting in     increased cAMP activity which results in watery diarrhea.


option c: Bacillus anthracis produces toxins that are made of 3 proteins-



• protective antigen (pA) binds to specific cell receptors and mediates entry of edema factor and lethal factor into the cell.
• Edema factor (EF) is an adenylate cyclase, which is activated only inside the target cells, leading to intracellular accumulation of cyclic AMp and causing tissue edema.
• Lethal factor (LF) causes tissue death.
option D: Shiga toxin or verotoxin is an exotoxin produced by Shigella species. It consists of two subunits A and B. The B subunit binds to globotriaosylceramide receptors on the target cell, and then, the A subunit gets internalized. The A subunit leads to inhibition of 6oS ribosome, leading  to shut down of protein synthesis.",1677-1070.PNG,B,1696-1083.PNG;1696-1082.PNG
Q16,A 13-year-old girl presented with fever and retro-orbital pain for 2 days. The tourniquet test and NS1 antigen test were positive. which of the following features is considered a criterion for the severe form of this disease?,"a)AST and ALT &gt;1ooo
b)Leucopenia plus thrombocytopenia
c)persistent vomiting
d)Hepatomegaly &gt;1cm","The given clinical scenario of a 13-year-old girl presenting with fever and retro-orbital pain with a  positive tourniquet and NS1 antigen tests is suggestive of dengue fever. AST or ALT &gt;=1ooo is a criterion for severe dengue.
Dengue is an acute febrile disease caused by the mosquito-borne dengue viruses (DENVs),
consisting of four serotypes (DENV 1 to 4), that are members of the Flaviviridae family, genus Flavivirus. It is transmitted from person to person by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
The world Health organisation released guidelines in 2oo9 regarding the diagnosis of probable dengue, dengue with warning signs, and a category known as severe dengue. In addition to the   classic DHF/DSS syndrome, rare cases of encephalitis or encephalopathy, liver damage, or
myocardial damage are also included in the category of severe dengue.
Criteria for severe dengue include:
• Severe plasma leakage leading to shock (DSS) and fluid accumulation with respiratory distress
• Severe bleeding
• Severe organ involvement- Liver: AST or ALT &gt;= 1ooo, CNS: Impaired consciousness, heart and other organs.
probable dengue includes those people who live in/ travel to dengue-endemic areas. Fever and 2 of the following criteria: nausea, vomiting, rash, aches and pain, Tourniquet test positive, leukopenia and any warning sign.
warning signs include:
• Abdominal pain or tenderness
• persistent vomiting
• Clinical fluid accumulation
• Mucosal bleed
• Lethargy, restlessness
• Hepatomegaly &gt;2 cm
• Laboratory: increase in HCT concurrent with thrombocytopenia.



After an incubation period of 3–15 days, classical dengue fever begins with an abrupt onset of high fever. The condition is self-limiting though debilitating with headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, petechiae rash, and leucopenia. A macular-papular recovery rash appears 3–4 days
after the onset of fever, and it usually starts on the trunk before spreading peripherally. The rash in dengue appears as 'white islands in a red sea' due to erythema with petechiae.
Shown below is an image of the rash in dengue:",,A,1654-1053.PNG
Q17,"A 25-year-old patient presented with a 3-day history of fever, headache, myalgia and
retro-orbital pain with no signs of bleeding. on examination, maculopapular rash is seen. which is the next appropriate step in management?","a)NS1 antigen detection
b)widal test
c)Rapid influenza antigen test
d)IgM ELISA","The given clinical scenario of a 25-year-old patient presenting with a 3-day history of fever,
headache, myalgia, retro-orbital pain with no signs of bleeding and a maculopapular rash on
examination is suggestive of dengue fever. The next appropriate step in management is getting an NS1 antigen detection test done.
Dengue is an acute febrile illness caused by the dengue virus that is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito.
It presents as sudden-onset fever, retroorbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, and a rash. The initial rash in dengue may appear as flushing erythema of the face in the first 2 days of symptoms.
A second rash occurs 3-6 days after the onset offever and appears maculopapular or morbilliform. Sometimes, lesions may coalesce and appear as 'white islands in a red sea' due to generalized
erythema with petechiae and islands of sparing.
Before day 5 of illness, during the febrile period, dengue infections may be diagnosed by detection of viral antigens like non-structural viral protein antigen(NS 1) by ELISA or rapid tests. This is
considered the mainstay of diagnosis.
virus isolation in cell culture and viral RNA detection by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) can also be done.
Serological tests, such as IgM ELISA (option D), are performed after day 5 when dengue viruses and antigens are no longer present in the blood due to the appearance of specific antibodies.



other options:
option B - widal test is used to diagnose typhoid fever caused by salmonella Typhi and paratyphi. It is characterized by gradual onset headache, malaise, step ladder pyrexia and gastrointestinal
symptoms like abdominal pain with either constipation or diarrhoea. They also present with rose spots on the skin during the 2nd to 3rd week, that fade on applying pressure.
The following image depicts rose spots in enteric fever.


option C: The rapid influenza antigen test uses immunofluorescence to demonstrate the influenza viral antigen on the surface of nasopharyngeal cells. The typical clinical disease has a sudden
onset of fever, headache, and generalised myalgia. The presence of respiratory symptoms is
prominent. It is not associated with retro-orbital pain and maculopapular rash, as given in the above scenario.",,A,1699-1084.PNG

b)Ebola virus
c)Salmonella typhi
d)Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus","Extensively drug-resistant(XDR)-TB is a biosafety level-3 infection.
Biohazard levels, also known as biosafety levels, are classifications of safety precautions required in the clinical microbiology laboratory based on specific pathogens handled when performing
laboratory procedures.
There are 4 classifications of biosafety levels (BSLs). Each level contains specific
recommendations for a clinical microbiology laboratory, with a focus on laboratory practises, safety equipment, and facility construction. As each level progresses, it includes additional
biosafety considerations from the previous level.



Microorganisms classified as biosafety level-3 can be lethal to humans, but there are vaccines and other treatments available for them. They include Mycobacterium tuberculosis, anthrax, many
types of viral encephalitis, hantavirus, Rift Valley fever, malaria, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and yellow fever.

Q20,which of the following statements are advantages of saline wet mount over iodine wet mount?,"a)1 and 2
b)1 and 3
c)2 and 3
d)1, 2 and 3","The advantages of saline wet mount over iodine wet mount include its ability to demonstrate the motility of trophozoites and to differentiate between bile and non-bile-stained eggs.
saline wet mount is an unstained preparation made by using physiological saline, while iodine wet mount is prepared either using diluted Lugol's iodine or Dobell and O'connor iodine solution.
saline wet mount aids in illustrating the motility of trophozoites such as E. histolytica,
Balantidium coli, and Giardia lamblia because it does not dry up as quickly as iodine wet mount.
It also helps differentiate between bile-stained and non-bile-stained eggs. Bile stained eggs appear brown, while non-bile stained eggs appear colourless. However in iodine wet mounts, it is
challenging to distinguish between bile-stained and non-bile-stained eggs because they are both stained brown.
since iodine clearly stains the glycogen vacuoles and nuclei, the idoine wet mount helps in
confirming the identification of cysts. Iodine-stained protozoan cysts display pale refractile nuclei, brown glycogen material, and yellow-gold cytoplasm.",,B,
Q21,which of the following helps the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to penetrate into the host cell?,"a)gp 12o
b)gp 41
c)CCR5
d)CXCR4","The HIV virus can penetrate the host's CD4+ cells with the help of the viral glycoprotein gp12o, also known as the spike antigen which is present in its envelope.
HIV-1 virion is spherical and contains an electron-dense, cone-shaped core surrounded by a lipid envelope derived from the host cell membrane. Target cells of HIV include CD4+ helper T cells    (worst affected), monocyte-macrophages, and dendritic cells.
The viral envelope is studded by two viral glycoproteins, gp12o and gp41, which are coded by the env gene. Gp12o also known as the principal envelope antigen forms surface spikes while gp41
functions as a transmembrane anchoring protein. Both of these are critical for HIV infection of cells.
Viral glycoprotein gp12o binds to CD4+ cells in the host. Binding to the CD4+ receptor requires the participation of a co-receptor molecule, which has been identified as CXCR4 for the T
cell-tropic HIV strains (X4 strains) and CCR5 for the macrophage-tropic strains (R5 strains).
This binding leads to a conformational change in gp41 causing exposure of a hydrophobic region called the fusion peptide at the tip of gp41. This peptide inserts into the cell membrane of the
target cells (e.g., T cells or macrophages), leading to the fusion of the virus with the host cell.
The virus core contains:
• Major capsid protein p24
• Nucleocapsid protein p7/p9
• Two copies of viral genomic RNA
• The three viral enzymes (protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase)
The viral core is surrounded by a matrix protein called p17, which lies underneath the virion envelope.

Q22,"An HIV-positive patient presented with headache, and neck stiffness. Fundoscopy revealed  papilledema. India ink staining of the CSF showed an encapsulated organism. which of the following statements is true regarding this condition?","a)Start ART after 2-3 weeks
b)opening pressure will be normal
c)Start amphotericin monotherapy
d)8o% patients will have positive radiological findings","The above clinical scenario and the stain findings are suggestive of cryptococcosis and the
causative organism is Cryptococcus neoformans. In a patient with Cryptococcus infection,
antiretroviral therapy should be started 2-3 weeks after initiation of treatment. This is due to a risk of immune reconstitution which can lead to severe inflammation and further worsen
symptoms.
C. neoformans spreads from inhalation of the yeast cells in pigeon faeces causing infection in
HIV/AIDS and other immunosuppressive conditions. In causes influenza-like respiratory infection in immunocompetent persons. In immunocompromised
it disseminates to CNS causing cryptococcal meningoencephalitis and patients may complain of
headaches, neck stiffness, and disorientation as in this case. other common sites of dissemination include the skin, adrenals, bone, eye, and prostate gland.


Diagnosis is made by demonstration of yeast cells or cryptococcal antigen in CSF. Cryptococcus
presents with raised intracranial pressure so precautions must be taken before taking a CSF
sample. (option B) India ink stain is used to demonstrate capsulated budding yeast cells in CSF as they have a distinctive appearance because their capsules exclude ink particles. Rapid detection of cryptococcal antigen in CSF and blood can also be done. Colonies develop within a few days on
most media at room temperature or 37°C. Media with cycloheximide should be avoided as it
inhibits Cryptococcus. MRIs and CT scans can be used but they're only reliable in about 21-27% of cases(option D).
Combination therapy of amphotericin B and flucytosine has been considered the standard treatment for cryptococcal meningitis(option C).",,A,1703-1088.PNG
Q23,which of the following techniques is used to detect autoantibodies?,"a)ELISA
b)Indirect immunofluorescence
c)Flow cytometry
d)Fluorescent in-situ hybridization","Circulating autoantibodies in serum are best detected by indirect immunofluorescence.



The two-step indirect immunofluorescence assay is used to find out if a serum specimen contains antibodies specific to a particular organism. A known antigen is first attached to a slide. After
incubating the slide with a serum sample, the sample is removed, the slide is washed, and a
second fluorescein-labelled anti-immunoglobulin is added. If the patient’s serum contains the
organism-specific antibodies, the organism will appear green under the fluorescence microscope.
This assay is the accepted method for identifying autoantibodies in autoimmune disorders (such as antinuclear antibodies) and detecting antibodies to certain microorganisms (eg, T. pallidum)   other options:
option A:  Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) is a type of heterogenous enzyme
immunoassay that involves the use of an immunosorbent, an absorbing material specific for one    of the components of the reaction: the antigen or antibody. It mainly detects antigens of infectious agents present in clinical specimens like rotavirus detection in fecal specimens and HIV
detection.
option C: Flow cytometry is a laser-based method that analyzes the cells and cell components
based on the presence of certain cell surface molecules which are named as per cluster of
differentiation (CD) nomenclature. It is very effective for the study of the immune system and its response to infectious diseases and cancer.


option D: Fluorescent In Situ Hybridisation (FISH) is a simple technique for the detection of
specific DNA sequences in cells/tissues. It uses fluorescent labelled probes to bind to
complementary DNA. FISH can be performed on prenatal samples, peripheral blood cells, touch preparations from cancer biopsies, and even fixed archival tissue sections.",,B,1704-1089.PNG
Q24,which of the following toxins acts by the mechanism shown below?,"a)clostridium difficile exotoxin
b)Diphtheria toxin
c)Botulinum toxin
d)streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin","The given image depicts a superantigen which binds to the variable β region of the T-cell receptor. streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (sPE) is a superantigen.
superantigens are a third variety of the biological class of antigens that activate a very large
number of T cells, irrespective of antigen specificity. This means they can activate T-cells directly without being processed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs).
• The variable β region of the T-cell receptor (vβ of TCR) appears to be the receptor for superantigens.
• They directly bridge non-specifically between MHC–II of APCs and T-cells.




The overproduction of cytokines, particularly IFN-γ, is a result of the massive activation of T cells. IFN-γ in turn activates macrophages to produce IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α , all of which may
contribute to a “cytokine storm” causing severe symptoms of shock and multiple organ failure.
Examples of superantigens:
• Bacterial
• staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin-1
• streptococcal toxin
• Mycoplasma arthritidis mitogen 1
• yersinia enterocolitica
• yersinia pseudotuberculosis
• Viral
• Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)
• Cytomegalovirus (CMV))
• Rabies nucleocaspid

• Fungal
• Malassezia furfur.",1680-1072.PNG,D,
Q25,In which of the following organisms' genetic material is adenine not equal to thymine?,"a)HIV
b)E coli
c)Human mitochondrial cells
d)Herpes virus","The genetic material of HIV consists of a single-stranded RNA and therefore adenine will not be equal to thymine.
The pyrimidine components of RNA can differ from those of DNA. Although RNA contains the ribonucleotides adenine (A), guanine (G), and cytosine (C), it contains uracil (u) instead of
thymine (T).
Because RNA is a single strand that is complementary to only one of two strands of a gene, its adenine content will not be equal to its uracil content and its guanine will not be equal to its    cytosine content.
Chargaff's rule states that double-stranded DNA, such as that found in E. coli, human
mitochondrial cells and herpes virus, will always have equal concentrations of (A 〓 T) and (G 〓 C). The pairings of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides on opposite strands are very specific and rely     on hydrogen bonds between A and T and G and C. The base pairs A-T and G-C are frequently
referred to as watson-Crick base pairs.",,A,
Q26,"An 18-month-old child presents with fever, irritability, neck stiffness and kernig's sign
positive. The mother gives a history of painful genital ulcers a year ago which had resolved spontaneously. what is the most likely causative agent?","a)Herpes simplex virus-2
b)cytomegalovirus (cMV)
c)Human papilloma virus (HPV)
d)varicella zoster virus","The given clinical scenario of an 18-month-old child presenting with fever, irritability, neck
stiffness and positive kernig's sign (CNS manifestations indicating meningitis) with the mother giving a past history of painful genital ulcers, is suggestive of neonatal herpes due to herpes
simplex virus (HSV)-2. CMV, HPV and varicella zoster virus do not present with painful genital ulcers and can be easily ruled out.
Painful genital ulcers are commonly seen in genital herpes and chancroid due to Hemophilus ducreyi ((ducreyi makes you cry).
Herpes infection can be caused by HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses. HSV-1 causes orofacial lesions, i.e. herpes labialis, while HSV-2 mainly causes genital herpes which is characterised by
vesiculoulcerative lesions of the penis of the male or of the cervix, vulva, vagina, and perineum of the female.
The typical herpes lesions are thin-walled, umbilicated vesicles, the roof of which breaks down, leaving tiny superficial ulcers which heal without scarring. The most common site of cutaneous lesions is in the face, cheeks, chin, around the mouth and forehead. A cesarean section is
performed in a case of active genital herpes at the time of labour in order to prevent neonatal herpes infection.
one of the following three disease patterns can be seen in infants infected during delivery or in the postpartum period: (1) disease limited to the skin, eyes, or mouth; (2) encephalitis with or
without skin, eye, and mouth disease; or (3) disseminated infection affecting several organs, such as the brain, lungs, liver, heart, and adrenal glands.
Infants suffering from encephalitis usually exhibit clinical symptoms that point to bacterial
meningitis at 8- 17 days of life. These symptoms include seizures, poor feeding, lethargy, neck
stiffness, irritability, and positive kernig's sign. when left untreated, HSV encephalitis results in 5o% of infant deaths and severe neurologic sequelae in the majority of survivors.
Acyclovir at a high dose of 6o mg/kg/day, administered intravenously every eight hours, should be the first line of treatment for any infant with a confirmed or suspected neonatal HSV infection.
other options
option B - The transplacental spread of cytomegalovirus (CMV) primarily affects the foetus,
resulting in microcephaly, intracranial calcification, hepatosplenomegaly, chorioretinitis, mental retardation, and sensorineural deafness. It is not associated with meningitis.
option C - Adolescents who are sexually active can contract genital HPV infection, which is
typically caused by HPV types 6 and 11. It can develop as a result of inoculation during childbirth through an infected birth canal or as a result of unintentional dissemination from cutaneous
warts. It results in moist, fleshy, verrucous growths on the skin of the labia majora, perineum,
perianal region, and vulva which are known as genital warts/venereal warts/condyloma acuminata. option D - Congenital varicella syndrome (CVS) is characterized by hypoplasia of limbs,
psychomotor retardation, IUGR, chorioretinal scarring, cataracts, microcephaly and cutaneous scarring. It is not associated with meningitis.",,A,
Q27,"which of the following organisms exhibits pathogenesis by cell-to-cell transfer, facilitated by actin filaments, eliminating the need for extracellular transport?","a)Enterohemorrhagic E. coli
b)salmonella typhi
c)Listeria monocytogenes
d)H. pylori","Listeria monocytogenes exhibit pathogenesis by cell-to-cell transfer with the help of the host cell's actin filaments.
L. monocytogenes is a short, gram-positive, non-spore-forming bacteria. It enters the body
through the GIT after ingestion of contaminated food such as cheese or vegetables. It has two cell-surface proteins, internalins A and B, which interact with the epithelial E-cadherin and
promote its own phagocytosis into the gut epithelial cells, leading to the formation of the phagolysosome.
Low pH activates the bacterium to produce listeriolysin o, which lyses the phagolysosome and    allows Listeria to escape into the cytoplasm of the epithelial cell. Here, the organisms proliferate and produce ActA, a listerial protein that induces host cell actin polymerization, which propels    them to the host cell membrane.
while pushing against the host cell membrane, they produce elongated protrusions called
filopods, which are ingested by adjacent epithelial cells, macrophages, and hepatocytes, resulting in the release of listeriae and the cycle starts again.
In this way, Listeria moves from cell-to-cell using the host's actin framework without being
exposed to antibodies, complement systems, or neutrophils. Gram-negative bacteria like shigella    flexneri and rickettsiae also make use of the host cells’ actin and contractile system to spread their infections, just like Listeria.
other options:
option A: Enterohemorrhagic Ecoli (EHEc) is one of the six different types of diarrheagenic
E.coli. They produce verocytotoxin (vT) or shiga-like toxin (sLT), which can lead to a spectrum of illnesses, from mild diarrhea to more severe, life-threatening conditions such as hemorrhagic
colitis (bleeding in the colon) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (Hus), which can cause kidney failure.
option B: salmonella typhi is a non-spore-forming, facultative anaerobic, gram-negative bacilli. Following ingestion of contaminated foods or beverages, salmonellae enter the small intestine,
where they pass through the epithelium via specialised M-cells overlying the peyer's patches, and then enter the intestinal lymphatics, with subsequent invasion into the bloodstream. unlike
Listeria, it does not utilise the actin filament of the host cell.
option D: H.pylori is a gram-negative, flagellated, helical bacterium. virulence factors of H.pylori include:
• Flagella- which allows motility in viscous gastric mucous
• urease production- urease generates ammonia and bicarbonate from endogenous urea, creating an alkaline microenvironment that protects it from gastric acidic pH.
• Adhesins- for bacterial attachment to surface foveolar cells
• Toxins- such as cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA) and vacuolization cytotoxin (vacA). cagA is   translocated into the gastric epithelial cells where it interferes with the epithelial cells’ cytoskeletal structure and induces IL-8 production, leading to neutrophil attraction. vacA causes gastric
mucosal injury by inhibiting T cells.",,C,
Q28,"A 19-year-old boy from a rural area presents with a 12-day history of altered mental status, decreased vision, ataxia, multiple cranial nerve palsies and hemiplegia. The electron
microscopy image of the organism is given below. what is the likely organism?","a)Acanthamoeba
b)Naegleria fowleri
c)sappinia
d)Balamuthia","In the given clinical scenario of a 19-year-old boy presenting with a 12-day history of altered mental status, decreased vision, ataxia, multiple cranial nerve palsies and hemiplegia with    electron microscopy showing an organism with characteristic spine-like pseudopodia
(acanthopodia) is suggestive of infection caused by Acanthamoeba species.
Acanthamoeba exists as an active trophozoite form and a resistant cystic form, both of which are   infective. The large, 2o–5o μm trophozoite form is distinguished by spine-like pseudopodia called acanthopodia.
Human beings acquire infection by inhalation of cysts or trophozoites, ingestion of cysts or
through traumatized skin or eyes. Following inhalation, the trophozoites reach the lungs and    invade the central nervous system through the bloodstream, producing granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE).
It presents chiefly as two chronic conditions: (1) keratitis and (2) encephalitis.
with a slow relapsing course, keratitis resembles severe herpetic keratitis; however, in the case of an amebic infection, the eye is extremely painful. The initial symptoms are unilateral
photophobia, excessive tearing, redness and foreign body sensation. keratitis and uveitis can     cause permanent vision loss or blindness. Diagnosis includes demonstrating the cyst in corneal scrapings using wet mount, histology, and culture.
Granulomatous amebic encephalitis is a serious infection of the brain and spinal cord that usually affects people who have a weakened immune system. The clinical picture is that of intracranial
space-occupying lesions with seizures, pareses, and mental deterioration. It is diagnosed by demonstration of trophozoites and cysts in brain biopsy, culture and immunofluorescence   microscopy using monoclonal antibodies.
No effective treatment is available for GAE. with limited success, multidrug combinations such as pentamidine, sulfadiazine, rifampicin, and fluconazole are used.
other options:
option B: The electron microscopy image of the infective form of Naegleria fowleri shows rounded pseudopodia called lobopodia. The infection usually follows swimming in freshwater rivers or
ponds. The amoebae invade the nasal mucosa and pass through the olfactory nerve branches in the cribriform plate into the meninges.
It is mainly associated with primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. The disease advances rapidly, causing fever, headache, vomiting, stiff neck, ataxia, seizure and coma.
option C: sappinia, a newly discovered human pathogen of the central nervous system (CNs), can cause amoebic encephalitis in humans. In the single case of sappinia amoebic encephalitis that
has been reported, a sinus infection occurred prior to the onset of symptoms. sappinia can be distinguished from other free-living amoeba by the presence of a distinctive double nucleus in which the 2 nuclei are closely apposed with a central flattening.
option D: Balamuthia is a leptomixid free-living amoeba, reported to cause GAE. It exists in the ameboid trophozoite stage and is not associated with acanthopodia as seen in Acanthamoeba
species.",1681-1073.PNG,A,

Reverse Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is a molecular analysis method used for the detection of RNA and thus helps in detecting RNA-containing viruses. It can be used to quantify mRNA
levels by generating complementary DNA (cDNA) copies of the mRNA using the reverse transcriptase enzyme.
Respiratory syncytial virus belongs to the Pneumovirus genera of the Paramyxoviridae family.
They contain a linear, single-stranded, nonsegmented, negative-sense RNA.
The northern blot technique can also be used to detect RNAs. Here, the mixture of mRNA
molecules is separated by electrophoresis and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and hybridized with radiolabeled probes.

b)Leptospirosis
c)Brucellosis
d)Scrub typhus","The given clinical scenario of a farmer presenting with fever and a black eschar lesion with
elevated creatinine levels of 1.4 mg/dl, indicating kidney injury, is suggestive of scrub typhus.
scrub typhus is caused by orientia tsutsugamushi and transmitted by trombiculid
mites.  Humans are infected when they are bitten by the mite larvae known
as chiggers. Transovarian transmission of microbes occurs in mites.
The incubation period is 1-3 weeks. The patient typically develops a characteristic eschar which is a punched-out ulcer covered with a blackened scab at the site of the mite bite, with regional
lymphadenopathy and maculopapular rash.
Renal involvement is a common systemic manifestation of scrub typhus. The severity of renal
involvement can range from minor urinary abnormalities such as albuminuria and active urinary sediments such as cellular casts, pyuria, and hematuria to acute kidney injury (AKI) necessitating the immediate initiation of renal replacement therapies.
other options:
option A: Anthrax- Cutaneous anthrax (Hide porter’s disease) present as a black eschar at the site of entry. At the site of entry of organism or spores, a papule develops in about 1–7 days. This
develops into a vesicle that later breaks down into an ulcer with a black, central, necrotic eschar



surrounded by edematous skin. The disease used to be common in dock workers, carrying loads of hides and skins on their bare backs. Renal involvement is unlikely to be seen in this condition.

c)Candida
d)Coccidioides","The given clinical vignette of a COVID-19 patient who was treated with steroids, presenting with blood-tinged nasal discharge, 3 weeks after recovery and histopathological examination showing broad, aseptate, ribbon-like hyphae with right angle branching is suggestive of mucor.
Mucormycosis is a fungal infection of the nose and sinuses caused by Mucor. It is an opportunistic infection seen even in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients with strong predisposing factors like    uncontrolled diabetes and those immunosuppressed or on steroids.
The common clinical form is rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis which occurs due to invasion of the blood vessels in the nasal cavity, eyes, and brain causing thrombosis, infarction, and necrosis.  The typical finding is black necrotic material filling the nasal cavity and eroding the nasal septum, hard palate and turbinates due to arterial and venous thrombosis leading to gangrene.
Diagnosis can be made by staining them with 1o% potassium hydroxide and culture. On
sabouraud agar at 3o-37°C, they appear as grey-white colonies with a thick cottony, fluffy surface. under the microscope, they appear as broad, ribbon-like, non-septate hyphae with hyphal
elements branching at right angles. They also contain aerial sporangiophores which end in a sac containing spores called sporangium.

b)Viral culture and isolation in aedes albopticus c6/36 cell line
c)RT-PCR
d)IgM ELISA","In a suspected case of dengue, where a patient presented with a 3-day history of symptoms like fever, headache, and retro-orbital pain, all the above investigations can be done except for
IgM-ELISA, which is used to identify antibodies against the dengue virus.
Dengue viruses belong to flaviviruses and present with sudden onset of fever (saddleback type),     frontal headache, retro-orbital pain, back pain, and severe myalgias. It is transmitted from person to person by the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.



The virus can be found in serum, plasma, circulating blood cells, and other tissues for 4-5 days
following the onset of the illness. Virus isolation, nucleic acid detection, or antigen detection can   be used to diagnose the infection in its early stages. Serology is the preferred method of diagnosis at the end of the acute phase of infection.
Before day 5 of illness, during the febrile period, diagnosis can be made by the following tests:
• Virus isolation can be done during the period of viremia i.e. usually before day 5. The mosquito cell line C6/36 (cloned from Aedes albopictus) or AP61 are the host cells of choice for routine
isolation of the dengue virus.
• RT-PCR - They have higher sensitivity than virus isolation and a much faster turnaround time.
• NS1 antigen can be detected up to 7-1o days after the onset of illness.
After day 5, dengue viruses and antigens disappear from the blood with the appearance of specific antibodies. The presence of IgM antibody or rising titres of IgG antibody on ELISA is used for
detecting and distinguishing primary and secondary dengue infections.",,D,
Q34,which of the following viruses has the least teratogenic effect?,"a)chickenpox
b)Rubella
c)cytomegalovirus (cMV)
d)Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2","In the given list of viruses, herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 has the least teratogenic effect.
HSV-2 presents as a genital tract infection transmitted via sexual contact. Premature labour or IUGR may occur if the primary infection is acquired during the last trimester. As the
transplacental route of spread is uncommon, it is considered to have a less teratogenic effect on the baby.
Caesarean delivery is recommended in cases of active primary genital HSV infection because the virus shed from the cervix or lower genital tract during vaginal delivery is a major source of
infection in the fetus.
Babies with neonatal herpes exhibit three categories of disease: (1) localized lesions of the skin,
eye, and mouth, (2) encephalitis with or without skin involvement and (3) disseminated disease. It is treated with IV acyclovir.
other options:
option A: The varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox, can pass through the placenta and result in congenital varicella syndrome (CVS). Hypoplasia of the limbs, psychomotor retardation, IUGR, chorioretinal scarring, cataracts and microcephaly are the characteristics of CVS. If
maternal infection develops after 2o weeks, the risk of congenital malformation is almost absent. Varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) should also be given to newborns exposed within 5 days  of delivery.
option B: The transplacental spread of the rubella virus is known to cause congenital rubella
syndrome (CRS) in the baby.  when this infection develops in the first, second or third months,   there is a 6o%, 25%, or 1o% chance of significant abnormalities, respectively. Congenital rubella
syndrome predominantly includes sensorineural deafness, patent ductus arteriosus
(PDA), cataracts and retinopathy. The virus predominantly affects the fetus and is extremely teratogenic if contracted within the first trimester.



option C: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) replicates in respiratory epithelial cells, salivary glands, and kidneys and persists in lymphocytes. The transplacental route primarily affects the foetus,
resulting in microcephaly, intracranial calcification, hepatosplenomegaly, chorioretinitis, mental retardation, and sensorineural deafness. unlike rubella, CMV may damage fetal organs
throughout gestation.",,D,
