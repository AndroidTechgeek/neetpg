Q1,Identify the condition shown in the image.,"a)Adenoid facies
b)Goldenhar syndrome
c)Horse facies
d)Frog facies","The given image shows adenoid facies. It is characterized by an elongated face with a dull
expression, an open mouth, a hitched-up upper lip, prominent upper teeth causing crowding
(malocclusion of teeth), a high arched hard palate (due to loss of tongue's molding action on the palate), and a pinched-in nose due to disuse atrophy of the alae nasi.


chronic nasal obstruction resulting in mouth breathing leads to this characteristic facial appearance in children.
Adenoids (nasopharyngeal tonsils) are prone to physiological enlargement during childhood.
Affected children present with symptoms of nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, sinusitis, and
rhinolalia clausa (loss of nasal tone of voice). They are prone to eustachian tube obstruction,
recurrent acute otitis media, chronic otitis media, and otitis media with effusion. They may also experience aprosexia (inability to concentrate) leading to declining scholastic performance.
pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale are potential long term complications other options:
option B: Goldenhar syndrome, also known as fascio-auriculo-vertebral dysplasia or
oculo-auriculo-vertebral (oAV) syndrome, is characterized by facial asymmetry, low set ears,
atresia of the ear canal, cardiac abnormalities, pre-auricular tags/pits, hemivertebrae in the
cervical region, epibulbar dermoid, coloboma of the upper lid, and mixed or conductive hearing loss.






option D: Frog facies is a characteristic presentation observed in cases of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. It is identified by the swelling of the cheeks, proptosis (protrusion of the eyeballs),   and broadening of the nasal bridge.",3266-2020.PNG,A,3272-2026.PNG;3273-2028.PNG;3273-2027.PNG
Q2,"The given image is of a person with a history of minor trauma with a piece of wood, 2o days back. His face is affected on the left side with facial swelling and orbital edema. CT scan
revealed clear sinuses and the presence of subcutaneous nodules. Microscopy of the tissue
sections was PAS-positive and stained positive with Grocott's methenamine silver stain. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)phycomycosis
b)Midline lethal granuloma
c)Foreign body granuloma
d)IgG4 granuloma","The history of facial swelling and orbital edema following trauma with wood and positive fungal stain (Grocott-Gomori's methenamine silver) points toward phycomycosis (mucormycosis), a
potentially invasive fungal infection.
Mucormycosis is an opportunistic mycosis caused by various molds in the Mucorales order which are ubiquitous thermotolerant saprobes. These molds, including Rhizopus, Mucor, and Absidia,    are common in the environment. The spores can be found in air and dust.



Mucormycosis can manifest as a localized cutaneous or subcutaneous infection in
immunologically normal individuals after traumatic exposure to soil or vegetation. It is a fatal condition due to its angio-invasive nature. Lung involvement is common, and the infection
primarily affects immunocompromised patients.
Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis is frequently seen in individuals with diabetic ketoacidosis. It typically starts with eye and facial pain and may progress to orbital cellulitis, proptosis, and
vision loss. A characteristic finding is a black necrotic mass filling the nasal cavity.
Diagnosis involves testing specimens and cultures. In exudate samples, wet preparations with
1o% potassium hydroxide (KoH) reveal broad, ribbon-like hyphae. Tissue biopsy confirms the      diagnosis by observing non-septate hyphae branching at right angles, characteristic of Mucorales like Rhizopus delemar.


Culture isolation is performed on sabouraud agar without cycloheximide, resulting in grey-white colonies with a thick cottony, and fluffy surface.
Treatment is primarily with liposomal amphotericin B. surgical debridement of the affected tissues and control of underlying predisposing cause is equally important.
other options:
option D: IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is characterized by tissue infiltrates dominated by IgG4 antibodies, which is the hallmark of the disease. IgG4-RD leads to fibrosis and obliterative
phlebitis. patients may present with Riedel's thyroiditis, autoimmune pancreatitis, or idiopathic
orbital inflammation, but not with ptosis. Diagnosis is confirmed through positive fibrosis and the presence of plasma cells on biopsy. Treatment with Rituximab is done.
option C: Foreign body granulomas are due to inflammation induced by inert foreign bodies.
These granulomas develop without T-cell-mediated immune responses. sutures are a common site for their formation. The foreign material is at the center of the granuloma, surrounded by
epithelioid cells and specific giant cells opposing the surface.
option B: Midline lethal granuloma is characterized by necrotizing destruction and damage to the nose and other respiratory structures. It is rare and usually a diagnosis of exclusion. CT scans can  detect the lesions associated with this condition. Negative c-ANCA (cytoplasmic antineutrophil



cytoplasmic antibodies) and fungal stain results contribute to the diagnosis.",3267-2021.PNG,A,3274-2029.PNG
Q3,which of the following are the objective tests for the hearing?,"a)1, 2, and 4
b)1,2, and 3
c)2,3, and 4
d)1,2,3, and 4","BERA, OAE, and tympanometry are the objective tests for hearing. PTA (pure tone audiometry) is a subjective test for hearing as it relies on patient responses to pure tone stimuli. Other examples  of subjective tests include tuning fork tests and speech audiometry.
Tympanometry is an objective test of the middle ear and eustachian tube functions (conductive
compartment of hearing). Here, the compliance of the TM, i.e., how much it moves to the pressure differentials applied from the external ear is measured.
The image below shows the types oftympanogram:",,A,Picture34.png
Q4,A young man presented with hearing loss and tinnitus. Histology image is shown below. what is the diagnosis?,"a)Neurofibroma
b)schwannoma
c)Leiomyoma
d)Rhabdomyoma","The history of hearing loss and tinnitus and the histology showing verocay bodies are suggestive of schwannoma.
vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma), is a benign tumor that predominantly originates    from the schwann cells in the vestibular division of the eighth cranial nerve, but it rarely arises from the cochlear division. It commonly affects individuals aged 4o-6o, with no gender
preference. Bilateral schwannomas occur in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2).
The most common presenting manifestations are progressive, unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, often accompanied by tinnitus.
It can involve all cranial nerves except the first and second. Apart from the 8th cranial nerve, the earliest cranial nerve to be involved is the 5th cranial nerve leading to reduced corneal sensitivity and paraesthesia of the face. This indicates that the tumor is roughly 2.5 cm in diameter and
occupies the cerebellopontine angle.



Facial nerve involvement causes hypoaesthesia of the posterior meatal wall (Hitzelberger sign), taste loss, and delayed blink reflex. The earliest sign is a delayed blink reflex.
Glossopharyngeal (IX) and vagus (X) nerve involvement result in
dysphagia and hoarseness. Brainstem involvement manifests as ataxia, limb weakness, numbness, and increased tendon reflexes. cerebellar involvement leads to an unsteady gait and
dysdiadochokinesia.
Histopathologically, the tumor comprises dense Antoni A areas with spindle cells in a palisading    pattern and Antoni B areas with loosely arranged spindle cells in a myxoid matrix. verocay bodies are formed in the Antoni A region, characterized by nuclear-free zones surrounded by palisaded     nuclei.
pure tone audiometry reveals sensorineural hearing loss, particularly in high frequencies. speech audiometry shows the roll-over phenomenon. The absence of the recruitment phenomenon is
noted. short Increment sensitivity Index (sIsI) ranges from o-2o%.
Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry (BERA) demonstrates a significant delay of &gt;o.2 ms  in wave v between the two ears. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with gadolinium contrast is considered the gold standard for diagnosis.
The primary management is the surgical removal of the tumor via the middle cranial fossa approach, the trans-labyrinthine approach, the suboccipital (retro sigmoid) approach, or a  combined trans-labyrinthine-suboccipital approach.
conventional radiotherapy using external beam radiation is not effective. In cases where surgery is contraindicated, refused by the patient, or when a residual tumor remains, alternative
treatments such as the x-knife or gamma knife can be considered.
other options:
option A: Neurofibromas are also benign nerve sheath tumours and the histological picture shows the presence of bland schwann cells admixed with stromal cells such as mast cells, perineural
cells, and fibroblasts. The stroma of the tumour contains loose collagen arranged in wavy bundles resembling carrot shavings.




option C: Leiomyomas are benign smooth muscle neoplasms that may occur single or multiple.
Microscopically, leiomyomas are comprised of well-differentiated, regular, spindle-shaped smooth muscle cells associated with hyalinization. very less mitotic figures are seen.


option D: Rhabdomyomas are the most frequent primary tumours ofthe heart in children.
Microscopically, they are composed of bizarre, markedly enlarged myocytes with abundant
glycogen. But due to routine histological processing, the glycogen content is reduced and looks     like thin strands that stretch from the nuclei to the surface membrane, which appears like spider cells.",3268-2022.PNG,B,3276-2030.PNG;3277-2032.PNG;3277-2031.PNG
Q5,All of the following are major diagnostic criteria for allergic fungal sinusitis except?,"a)presence of nasal polyps
b)Eosinophilic mucin without invasion
c)Characteristic CT findings
d)positive fungal culture","A positive fungal culture is a minor and not a major diagnostic criterion for allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS).



The Bent and kuhn diagnostic criteria for allergic fungal rhinosinusitis include:
Major criteria:
• Type I hypersensitivity
• Nasal polyposis
• characteristic cT findings
• Eosinophilic mucin without invasion
• Positive fungal stain
Minor criteria:
• Asthma
• unilateral disease
• Bone erosion
• Fungal cultures
• charcot-Leyden crystals
• serum eosinophilia
All the major criteria must be met by the patient while the minor criteria serve to support the diagnosis and describe individual patients.
characteristic cT findings in AFRs include heterogeneous signal intensities within the paranasal sinuses filled with allergic mucin (double density sign), expansion of the paranasal sinuses/nasal  cavity, unilateral or asymmetric disease load, and bony erosion.
The treatment of allergic fungal sinusitis includes avoidance of allergen exposure, antihistamines,
corticosteroid nasal sprays, aggressive surgical intervention for mucin removal which improves sinus drainage, post-surgery oral corticosteroids, and immunotherapy against fungal and
non-fungal allergens.",,D,
Q6,which among the following is not used in post laryngectomy rehabilitation?,"a)Tracheo-esophageal prosthesis
b)Esophageal speech
c)polite yawning
d)super supraglottic swallow","super supraglottic swallow is not used in post-laryngectomy rehabilitation.
super-supraglottic swallow is a maneuver that prevents the aspiration of food or liquid by closing the airway before swallowing. It is used in the management of dysphagia. This method involves
holding one’s breath to close the airway prior to swallowing, followed by coughing voluntarily
immediately after swallowing to clear any residual food or liquid from the airway entrance. It is an effortful breath-holding technique, which not only results in valsalva and subsequent leakage of     bolus but can also result in arrhythmias.
other options:
option A: A tracheoesophageal prosthesis(TEP) involves a one-way valve that is inserted through a previously-created tracheoesophageal puncture. when the patient occludes the stoma, the
exhaled air is shunted through the TEP into the oesophagus, where it induces vibration of the
upper oesophagal sphincter, which is responsible for phonation. It generates the most intelligible,



fluent, natural-sounding voice in contrast to other laryngeal speech methods.


option B: oesophagal speech also involves vibration of the upper oesophagal sphincter and subsequent phonation.


option C: polite yawning also called the nasal airflow-inducing maneuver is an important olfaction rehabilitation tool after a laryngectomy.
Electrolarynx produces vibrations that are transmitted through the skin toward the throat. The    sound generated is converted into low-pitch speech by the vocal tract—palate, tongue, and teeth. The advantages are that is easy and quick to learn, while the disadvantages are that the voice is    monotonous and the constant occupation of one hand.",,D,3279-2034.PNG;3280-2035.PNG
Q7,which of the following devices can be used in a patient with bilateral external auditory canal atresia?,"a)1
b)2
c)3
d)4","Device 1 shown in the above image represents bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA), which can be  used in a patient with bilateral external auditory canal atresia. cochlear implants (Device 2) are   primarily used to restore sensorineural hearing loss, whereas BAHA is used in cases with defects in the outer or middle ear.
External auditory canal atresia refers to the absence of a patent ear canal and this can either be congenital or acquired.
congenital atresia: The external ear develops from the first and second pharyngeal arch and the first pharyngeal cleft. Atresia of the external canal can occur in association with microtia
(under-developed pinna) or with abnormalities of the middle ear, internal ear, and other structures. It is usually bilateral.
Acquired atresia: A rare condition, following external ear trauma, such as road traffic accidents, gunshot wounds, or recent otologic surgery. In rare instances, canal stenosis and atresia have
been observed in association with neoplastic changes and idiopathic inflammatory processes.
Bilateral aural atresia will present with failed audiological testing and require early bone
conduction hearing aids, one of which is BAHA, that combines a sound processor with a small
titanium fixture implanted behind the ear and allows the bone to transfer sound to a functioning cochlea rather than via the middle ear – a process known as direct bone conduction.
A picture of BAHA is shown below. It consists of three parts, an innermost titanium fixture in the bone, a middle abutment, and an outer hearing aid fixed to the abutment.





Bone-anchored Hearing Aids (BAHA) are used:
• when air-conduction (AC) hearing aid cannot be used:
• people who have chronic inflammation or infection of the ear canal associated with discharge and cannot wear standard “in the ear” air-conduction hearing aids.
• Children with malformed or absent outer ear and ear canals as in microtia or canal atresia.
• In conductive or mixed hearing loss, e.g. otosclerosis and tympanosclerosis where surgery is contraindicated
• In unilateral deafness other options:
option B: Device 2 is a picture of a cochlear implant. It is a medical device that uses electricity to stimulate the spiral ganglion cells of the auditory nerve to restore sensorineural hearing loss. It     converts sound to an electrical signal (transduction) and delivers this to the hearing nerve, which bypasses the damaged hearing apparatus. It cannot be used in patients with cochlear aplasia or    without the VIIIth cranial nerve.
option C: Device 3 is a picture of a stapedectomy piston, used in patients with otosclerosis.
option D: Device 4 is a picture of a partial ossicular replacement prosthesis that is designed for situations when the incus and/or malleus are eroded but the stapes is structurally intact.",3269-2023.PNG,A,3281-2036.PNG;3282-2037.PNG
Q8,"A 65-year-old patient presents with right-sided nasal obstruction and occasional
blood-stained nasal discharge. His CT and endoscopy findings are shown in the below image. what could be the underlying cause?","a)Inverted papilloma
b)Carcinoma maxilla
c)Esthesioneuroblastoma
d)Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma","In an elderly patient, unilateral nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and pale polypoidal mass arising from the lateral wall of the nose are suggestive of inverted papilloma (Ringertz tumor).
Inverted papilloma (transitional cell papilloma) is a tumor originating from the nonolfactory
mucosa of the nose (schneiderian membrane) and paranasal sinuses. The most common site of
origin is the lateral wall of the nose in the middle meatus.The unilateral growth of hyperplastic
papillomatous tissue into the stroma characterizes this condition. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is believed to be the cause.
It primarily affects men aged 4o-7o and presents unilaterally with symptoms such as nasal
obstruction, nasal discharge, and epistaxis. Invasive growth into the sinuses or orbit can lead to proptosis, diplopia, and lacrimation.
on nasal endoscopy, it appears as a pale polypoidal mass resembling a nasal polyp. computed     tomography (cT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to determine the location and extent of the lesion. MRI can also help differentiate between associated sinus secretions and the  tumor mass. Biopsy is essential for diagnosis, as it is important to differentiate it from simple
nasal polyps, which may be associated with or mistaken for the tumor.
The treatment of choice is medial maxillectomy, which can be performed through lateral
rhinotomy, sublabial degloving approach, or preferably, an endoscopic approach. In 1o%-15% of cases, the tumor is associated with malignancy. Recurrence is possible, and radiotherapy is
generally not recommended due to the potential risk of inducing malignancy.
other options:
option B: carcinoma maxilla arises from the lining of the maxillary sinus and its early features include additional symptoms like facial paraesthesias, pain, or epiphora and depending on the  direction of spread of the growth, would cause additional symptoms.



option C: Esthesioneuroblastoma (olfactory neuroblastoma) arises from the olfactory epithelium  in the upper third of the nose. It has bimodal peaks of incidence at 1o–2o years and 5o–6o years. unilateral nasal obstruction and epistaxis are the most common symptoms. The tumour also
invades the orbit and the surrounding structures, which results in other symptoms like proptosis, headache, epiphora, diplopia, and blurred vision.
option D: Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is seen almost exclusively in males in the age     group of 1o–2o years and is very rarely seen in older people and females. profuse, recurrent, and spontaneous epistaxis is the most common presentation.",3270-2024.PNG,A,
Q9,"A patient presents with vertigo, tinnitus, and head tilt. He underwent myringoplasty for the    safe type of chronic suppurative otitis media(CSOM) 6 months back. what is your diagnosis?","a)peri-lymphatic fistula
b)Labyrinthitis
c)paget disease
d)vestibular schwannoma","The presentation of vertigo, tinnitus, and head tilt following myringoplasty suggests a diagnosis of perilymphatic fistula.
A perilymphatic fistula is an abnormal connection between the inner ear and middle ear, resulting in leakage of perilymph from the cochlea or vestibule. This most commonly occurs through the
round or oval window.
Causes of perilymphatic fistula include post-stapedectomy, ear surgery with dislocation of the
stapes, head trauma, inner ear injury due to forceful valsalva or barotrauma, raised intracranial pressure, and occasionally spontaneous or idiopathic.
Clinically, intermittent vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and a sense of
fullness in the affected ear are present. The fistula test is positive, and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the temporal bone is highly sensitive for detecting the fistula. A
combination of CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can diagnose almost all cases.
Audiometry and electrocochleography may be performed additionally.
Management of perilymphatic fistula can be conservative or surgical. Conservative measures involve avoiding activities that increase inner ear or intracranial pressure and using
intra-tympanic steroids for acute decompensation.
other options:
option B: Labyrinthitis presents with unilateral vestibular symptoms like sudden onset of     persistent vertigo with associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, sweating, and pallor.
symptoms may progress resulting in nystagmus and hearing loss. Tinnitus is not a common finding in labyrinthitis.
option C: paget's disease of bone usually presents with hearing loss as a prominent feature, when the skull is involved. It is not associated with a history of surgery, trauma, or vestibulocochlear
symptoms.
option D: vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma), originates from schwann cells in the  vestibular division of the vestibulocochlear (vIIIth cranial) nerve within the internal auditory canal. The main symptoms are progressive unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. other cranial nerves (v, IX, X, XI) may also be involved.",,A,
Q10,what is the probable diagnosis based on the finding given in the CT image?,"a)concha bullosa
b)pneumatised superior turbinate
c)onodi cell
d)Haller cell","The given CT image reveals a pneumatised superior turbinate.
The superior turbinate, located posteriorly and superiorly to the middle turbinate can become
pneumatized. It forms an important landmark to identify the ostium of the sphenoid sinus which lies medial to it. This pneumatization is common in the lateral nasal wall, although it is less
frequently seen in the superior turbinate compared to the middle turbinate.
In most cases, pneumatized superior turbinate is an incidental finding during radiological   examinations. It can lead to nasal obstruction, headache, epistaxis, anosmia, and postnasal drainage.
Asymptomatic cases of superior turbinate pneumatization generally do not require treatment.    However, when symptoms are present, various surgical techniques can be considered, including outfracture, crushing, radio-frequency ablation, turbinoplasty, and microdebrider surgery.
Turbinoplasty is contraindicated if inferior turbinate pneumatization is associated with the  maxillary sinus because it may result in the formation of a second ostium. In addition, total turbinectomy is not performed because it may cause atrophic rhinitis.
other options:
option A: pneumatization of the middle turbinate leads to an enlarged middle turbinate that is  ballooned out, this is called concha bullosa. The CT image shown below depicts concha bullosa.


option C: onodi cell is a posterior ethmoidal cell that may grow posteriorly, either by the side of the sphenoid sinus or superior to it. onodi cell is surgically important as the optic nerve may be  related to its lateral wall.  A CT image of an onodi cell is shown below.





option D: Haller cells are air cells situated in the roof of the maxillary sinus. They are
pneumatized from anterior or posterior ethmoid cells. Enlargement of Haller cells may lead to maxillary sinusitis as it may encroach the ethmoid infundibulum, impeding draining of the
maxillary sinus. A CT image of Haller cell is shown below.",3271-2025.PNG,B,3284-2038.PNG;3285-2040.PNG;3285-2039.PNG
