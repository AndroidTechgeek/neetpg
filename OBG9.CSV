Q1,"A pregnant woman at 36 weeks of gestation with a prosthetic valve replacement for mitral stenosis is on warfarin therapy. Her INR is 3. what is the appropriate next step in
management?","a)stop warfarin and start LMwH
b)stop warfarin and start heparin
c)continue warfarin
d)stop warfarin, start LMwH and asprin","The next appropriate step in the management of a pregnant woman with a prosthetic valve on warfarin therapy at 36 weeks of gestation is to stop warfarin and start low molecular weight
heparin (LMWH).
Warfarin is safe and effective in preventing thromboembolism in the mother during the 2nd
trimester. However, it is teratogenic and can lead to miscarriage, stillbirths, fetal anticoagulation, and fetal embryopathy if used in the 1st trimester.
Heparin is safe for the fetus as it does not cross the placenta but is less effective than warfarin in preventing thromboembolism.
LMWH- Low molecular weight heparin, UFH- Unfractionated heparin
For patients taking LMWH, factor xa levels should be monitored weekly.
Heparin should be discontinued just before (at least 6 hours before) delivery. If delivery occurs before discontinuation and there is extensive bleeding, then iv protamine sulfate can be given.



Warfarin or heparin anticoagulation can be restarted after 6 hours of vaginal delivery, usually without any problem.
Warfarin, LMWH, and UFH do not accumulate in breast milk and do not have an anticoagulant effect in the newborn. They are compatible with breastfeeding.
other options:
option B: Unfractionated heparin can also be given instead of LMWH. However, in this case, the better answer is to give LMWH; because, in clinical practice, LMWHs have a long half-life,
once-daily dosing, and fewer side effects. If LMWH is unavailable or cost-prohibitive, or if anti-xa levels cannot be monitored, continuous infusion of UFH can be used as an alternative to LMWH.
option D: Aspirin 75-1oo mg can be given daily during pregnancy. It can be continued in women with mechanical heart valves if needed for other indications.

Q2,A 27-year-old female patient was found to have uterus didelphys. which of the following is not likely to be a complication of this uterine anomaly?,"a)Abortion
b)Endometriosis
c)preterm labor
d)Transverse lie","Among the given options, transverse lie is not a likely complication of uterus didelphys. A transverse lie is more likely to be seen with an arcuate or sub-septate uterus.
A uterus didelphys is a Mullerian defect characterized by two separate uterine horns, each with an endometrial cavity and uterine cervix. It occurs due to the failure of fusion of the Müllerian ducts. It is usually asymptomatic but can rarely present with dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, hematocolpos, and hematometra. Rarely, endometriosis (option B) and genital neoplasms may be associated with uterus didelphys.
pregnancy is possible with uterus didelphys, however, there is an increased risk of the following complications:
• spontaneous abortion (option A)
• preterm labor (option C)
• Breech presentation
• Cesarean delivery
• Intrauterine growth restriction
• Low birth weight (&lt;2.5kg)
• perinatal death



uterus didelphys can be diagnosed with ultrasound or hysterosalpingography, but MRI provides the most accurate diagnosis.",,D,6055-3795.PNG
Q3,"A woman who underwent dilatation and curettage for molar pregnancy 6 months ago
presents with persistent symptoms of abdominal pain and distention. On further evaluation, the beta-hcG levels were persistently elevated and cannonball foci were found on the chest    X-ray. what is the appropriate management in this case?","a)Methotrexate with folinic acid
b)Methotrexate
c)EMAcO regimen
d)Hysterectomy","The given clinical scenario of a woman with a past history of D(&amp;)C for molar pregnancy,  now presenting with abdominal pain and distension, elevated beta-HCG levels, and cannonball metastasis to the lung is suggestive of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN).
The next step is to categorize the patient as low/high risk based on the WHO prognostic scoring system to decide the treatment modality.
WHO Prognostic scoring system, adapted by FIGO:
Based on the available clinical information,
• Antecedent gestation: molar pregnancy, score= o
• Interval: 6 months, score= 1
• site of metastasis: lung, score= o
The total score is 1, hence it is a case of low-risk GTN and the management involves treatment with methotrexate with folinic acid.
Treatment of GTN:
Low-risk GTN (FIGO stages I-III: score &lt;7): single-agent chemotherapy with methotrexate (MTX) or dactinomycin (less commonly used).
• 5o mg MTX is given IM on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 with folinic acid on alternate days.
High-risk GTN (FIGO stages II-III: score &gt;7 and stage IV): Multiple agent chemotherapies, with or without adjuvant surgery or radiotherapy. The preferred multiple-agent chemotherapy regime is the EMACO regime:
• Etoposide



• Methotrexate
• Dactinomycin (actinomycin D)
• cyclophosphamide
• vincristine (Oncovin)
The FIGO Anatomic staging of GTN is shown in the image below:

Q4,A female patient has a history of three miscarriages. Identify the investigation that was done from the image shown below.,"a)Hysteroscopy
b)saline infusion sonography
c)Hysterosalpingography
d)Transvaginal ultrasonography","The investigation shown in the given image is hysterosalpingography. The given
hysterosalpingogram shows a unicornuate uterus.
Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is an imaging modality in which radiopaque contrast is injected through the cervical canal to assess the endometrial cavity, the fallopian tubes, and the
endocervical canal.
HSG should be done between days 5 and 1o of the menstrual cycle, in the preovulatory phase, as an outpatient procedure. Leech wilkinson cannula, Rubin's cannula, or Foley's catheter no.14 is  introduced into the endometrial cavity through the cervical os, and the contrast is injected. The   uterine cavity and fallopian tubes are then visualized and X-rays are obtained.
HSG can be used for the following:
• To assess tubal patency in infertility
• To detect uterine anomalies, synechiae, and polyps
• To detect incompetence of the cervical os
contraindications to HSG:
• Acute pelvic infection
• Active uterine bleeding
• pregnancy/ suspected pregnancy
• contrast allergy
• premenstrual phase
HSG is a safe procedure, however, complications such as ascending spread of infection, chemical peritonitis, allergic reaction to the dye, or pelvic endometriosis may occur.






other options:
option A: Hysteroscopy is an operative procedure in which the uterine cavity can be visualized by passing a fiberoptic telescope via the cervix. It can be diagnostic or therapeutic. A hysteroscopic    image of a uterus with carcinoma is shown below.





option B: saline infusion sonography is a procedure where normal saline is injected into the     uterine cavity and the uterus is imaged with transvaginal sonography. It is shown in the image below.


option D: Transvaginal ultrasonography is a noninvasive imaging technique using the
transvaginal approach. It provides a more detailed evaluation of the pelvic organs as compared to the transabdominal approach.",6048-3794.PNG,C,6058-3799.PNG;6058-3798.PNG;6059-3801.PNG;6059-3800.PNG
Q5,"A 56-year-old multipara woman presented with grade II/III uterine prolapse with cystocele. she complains of passing urine on coughing and sneezing. what is the type of urinary
incontinence seen in this patient?","a)overflow incontinence
b)urge incontinence
c)stress incontinence
d)Neurogenic bladder","The type of urinary incontinence present in a patient with prolapse and cystocele experiencing urination on coughing and sneezing is stress incontinence.



stress incontinence refers to the involuntary leakage of urine when there is increased
intra-abdominal pressure (eg, coughing, sneezing, laughing, valsalva maneuver). Absence of detrusor muscle contraction is seen in urodynamic studies.
causes:
• Age and menopause - due to estrogen deficiency
• Multiparity - due to loss of pelvic muscle tone
• obesity
• smoking
• constipation, chronic cough
• pelvic organ prolapse
• pregnancy - due to the effect of progesterone and pressure of the gravid uterus on the bladder neck.
• puerperium - due to descent of the bladder neck, loss of urethro-vesical angle, and reduced pelvic muscle tone
• surgical repair of vesicovaginal fistula
Grading of genuine stress incontinence (GsI) :
• Grade I: Incontinence with only severe stress, such as coughing, sneezing, and jogging.
• Grade II: Incontinence with moderate stress, such as fast walk, going up and down the stairs.
• Grade III: Incontinence with mild stress such as standing.
Investigations are only done prior to surgery to confirm the diagnosis. They include:
• stress test
• cotton swab or Q-tip test
• Marshall and Bonney’s test
• urethroscopy
• urodynamic studies.
These are not required prior to conservative management.
conservative management includes kegel's pelvic exercises, electric nerve stimulation, devices like pessaries, vaginal cones, and artificial sphincters. Medical treatment with estrogen creams, alpha   agonists, venlafaxine, and imipramine may be useful.
other options:
option A: overflow incontinence is an old term that refers to the inability to empty the bladder,
with involuntary, continuous urinary dribbling. currently, it refers to another presentation of urge incontinence.
option B: urge incontinence is the involuntary escape of urine when there is an imminent need to urinate. It occurs due to detrusor muscle overactivity or detrusor instability. It is seen more
commonly in old women with decreased bladder capacity, decreased sensation, and cNs inhibition.



option D: Neurogenic bladder occurs in patients with neurogenic dysfunction leading to detrusor hyperreflexia. conditions such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson's disease, and spinal injury give rise to this. They present with urgency or urge incontinence.",,C,
Q6,A 32-year-old married woman who came for the evaluation of infertility was found to have a septum in her uterine cavity. what would be the appropriate management of this case?,"a)Hysterectomy
b)Laparoscopy and metroplasty
c)Hysteroscopy and septoplasty
d)Laparotomy and metroplasty","The appropriate management for a 32-year-old woman with a septate uterus is hysteroscopy and septoplasty.
Hysteroscopic septoplasty refers to the resection of the uterine septum
under hysteroscopic guidance. The septum can be resected either with a resectoscope or a laser. It does not scar the uterus and avoids the necessity of cesarean sections for future pregnancies.
There is a reduced risk of pelvic adhesions, compared with transabdominal approaches.
A septate uterus is characterized by a septum in the endometrial cavity. It is caused by the failure  of the medial segments of the Müllerian ducts to regress. This creates a permanent septum within the uterine cavity.
The septum can project partially from the fundus or extend completely to the cervical os. It is the most common congenital uterine malformation in women with infertility.
other options:
option A: Hysterectomy is not advisable since the patient has come for infertility evaluation and desires pregnancy.
options B &amp; D: Laparoscopy/laparotomy and metroplasty are not preferred for the treatment of a septate uterus due to the following:
• Requirement of cesarean section for subsequent pregnancies to prevent uterine rupture.
• Postoperative pelvic adhesions leading to infertility.
Note: Jone's and Tompkin's metroplasties are surgeries for the septate uterus that involve a transabdominal approach. They cause uterine scarring and are hence not preferred.",,C,
Q7,"A 3o-year-old G4A3 woman had a history of miscarriage at 8 weeks, the second miscarriage at 11 weeks with no cardiac activity, and the third pregnancy loss at 24 weeks with preterm   delivery due to early-onset preeclampsia. what is the most probable diagnosis?","a)syphilis
b)Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome
c)TORCH infections
d)Gestational diabetes mellitus","The given clinical scenario of a G4A3 woman with miscarriages at 8 and 11 weeks, and preterm delivery due to preeclampsia at 24 weeks is suggestive of antiphospholipid antibody (APLA)
syndrome.
APLA is an autoimmune disorder commonly associated with fetal death, preterm delivery, early-onset preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction due to placental insufficiency and
thromboses. Pregnancy loss usually occurs before 1o weeks.
Diagnosis of APLA requires at least 1 clinical criterion and 1 laboratory criterion.
• obstetric criteria
• one or more unexplained deaths of a morphologically normal fetus at or beyond 1o weeks or
• severe preeclampsia or placental insufficiency requiring delivery before 34 weeks, or



• Three or more unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortions before 1o weeks
• Laboratory criteria
• presence of lupus anticoagulant, or
• Anticardiolipin antibodies, or
• Anti-β2 glycoprotein antibody
Recurrent pregnancy loss (RpL), also referred to as a recurrent miscarriage or habitual abortion,   is historically defined as 3 consecutive pregnancy losses prior to 2o weeks from the last menstrual period.
Common causes include:
• parental chromosomal abnormalities
• untreated hypothyroidism
• uncontrolled diabetes mellitus
• uterine anatomic abnormalities,
• Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome
other options:
option A: There is no history of sTD or skin lesions suggestive of syphilis and according to
kassawitz rule, in women with untreated syphilis having a series of pregnancies, the likelihood of fetal infection in later pregnancies becomes less; usually, only the first pregnancy is an abortion,   the following pregnancy losses will be stillbirths in the next trimester rather than recurrent
pregnancy loss.
option C: ToRCH infections may play a role in sporadic spontaneous pregnancy loss, rather than recurrent pregnancy losses.
option D: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) refers to the onset or first recognition of diabetes  during pregnancy, usually at the 24-28 weeks screening test. women with uncontrolled overt or   pregestational diabetes with elevated HbA1c or preprandial glucose in the first trimester have an  increased risk for early miscarriage, but there is a history or lab findings suggestive of gestational diabetes mellitus.",,B,
Q8,"A 26-year-old female patient came with a history of fatiguability and constipation for the past  1 year. she has a history of multiple blood transfusions after delivery 4 years ago. she has had a lactational failure and never regained her periods after the delivery. what is the most
probable diagnosis?","a)sheehan syndrome
b)Hypothyroidism
c)premature ovarian failure
d)Delayed blood transfusion reaction","The most likely diagnosis in a woman with lactational failure and postpartum amenorrhea, now presenting with fatiguability and constipation is sheehan syndrome. A history of multiple blood transfusions after delivery indicates major obstetric blood loss, which resulted in pituitary
ischemia leading to this condition.
sheehan syndrome is panhypopituitarism due to pituitary ischemia and necrosis following massive obstetrical hemorrhage.
The most severe form presents with shock due to pituitary apoplexy. It is characterized by a
sudden onset headache, nausea, visual deficits, and hormonal dysfunction due to acute pituitary hemorrhage or infarction. Less severe forms present with anovulation and amenorrhea.



Damage to specific pituitary cell types leads to lactational failure, loss of axillary and pubic hair,    and symptoms of hypothyroidism or adrenal insufficiency. prolactin deficiency is most commonly encountered, but adrenal insufficiency is the most life-threatening complication. Hence, the
adrenal function should be immediately assessed if there is any suspicion of Sheehan syndrome.
option B: Hypothyroidism can present with vague symptoms such as fatigue, constipation, and amenorrhea. However, postpartum hypothyroidism usually presents 4-8 months after delivery  after a thyrotoxic phase with palpitations and thyroid enlargement.
option c: premature ovarian failure presents with menopausal symptoms. It is due to primary ovarian dysfunction. It is diagnosed when serum FSH levels are &gt;3o-4o mIU/mL on two
occasions, at least one month apart.
option D: Delayed transfusion reaction presents days to weeks after the transfusion. It may be asymptomatic or with low-grade fever. coombs test may be positive, unconjugated bilirubin
increased, and the rise in hemoglobin levels following the transfusion will be less than expected.",,A,
Q9,The ultrasound of a young woman with infertility is suggestive of a uterine anomaly. which of the following is used to confirm the diagnosis?,"a)Hysterosalpingography
b)Hysteroscopy + laparoscopy
c)Laparoscopy
d)Transvaginal sonography","Among the given options, hysteroscopy with laparoscopy is used to confirm the diagnosis.
For infertility evaluation, hysteroscopy and laparoscopy can detect müllerian anomalies, screen for co-existent endometriosis, and exclude other tubal or uterine cavity pathology.
This approach can differentiate between a septate and a bicornuate uterus. on laparoscopy, the presence of a uterine fundus indicates that the uterus is septate, while its absence indicates it is bicornuate. The capacity of each horn in a bicornuate uterus and the depth and thickness of the uterine septum prior to surgical resection can also be assessed.
MRI is the gold standard investigation for the diagnosis of Mullerian anomalies. It clearly
delineates both the internal and external uterine anatomy. complex anomalies and common   associations like renal or skeletal anomalies can also be evaluated. It is also less invasive than hysteroscopy and laparoscopy in diagnosing Mullerian anomalies.
other options:
option A: Hysterosalpingography (HSG) provides information about the interior contour of the uterine cavity but cannot accurately visualize the external contour of the uterus.
option c: Laparoscopy alone as a diagnostic procedure cannot visualize the interior contour of a    hollow viscus like the uterus. This can be done only with the help of hysteroscopy or imaging such as sonography, HSG, or MRI.
option D: Transvaginal sonography is used for the initial detection of uterine anomalies causing infertility or spontaneous abortions. complete evaluation of these anomalies is done by MRI.
Note:
• Hysteroscopy is the gold standard investigation to visualize the uterine cavity and tubal ostia. It also has therapeutic benefits in cases of endometrial polyps, submucous resection of myoma,
hysteroscopic adhesiolysis, and resection of uterine septum.
• Laparoscopy is the gold standard investigation to evaluate tubal factors of infertility.",,B,
Q10,"A 26-year-old pregnant woman, on examination was found to have infra-umbilical flattening. The fetal heart sounds were heard over the lateral side. what could be the fetal
presentation/position?","a)Brow
b)knee
c)occipitoposterior
d)Right dorso-anterior","The presence of infra-umbilical flattening and fetal heart sounds on the lateral side indicates that the fetus is in the occipito-posterior position.
occipito-posterior (op) position of the fetus is when the occiput is situated posteriorly over the sacroiliac joint, or directly over the sacrum. The fetus is in vertex presentation.
Examination findings of op position:
• on inspection, the abdomen appears flattened below the umbilicus (infra-umbilical flattening).
• pelvic grips:
• The head is not engaged.
• The sinciput (cephalic prominence) is not prominently felt.
• Auscultation: Fetal heart sounds are heard maximally over the flanks. However, in the direct op position, they are heard in the midline.
There are three variants of op position:
• Left op position (fourth position of the vertex) - when the occiput points towards the left sacroiliac joint.
• Right op position (third position of the vertex) - when the occiput points towards the right sacroiliac joint. It is more common than the left op position.
• Direct op position - when the occiput points directly towards the sacrum.
All three positions may be primary (present before the onset of labor) or secondary (develops after the onset of labor).
other options:
option A: Brow presentation is a rare type of cephalic presentation where the position of the head is in between full flexion and full extension. The part of the head between the orbital ridge and the anterior fontanel presents at the pelvic inlet.
option B: knee presentation is a type of breech presentation. Here, the thighs are extended but the knees are flexed, presenting at the pelvic inlet. The head will be palpable as a hard globular mass at the fundus.
option D: Right dorso-anterior position is when the fetal back is directed anteriorly. This occurs     in a transverse lie. on examination, the abdomen appears wide, and a hard plane of resistance is    felt. The fundus extends just above the umbilicus. The head is felt in one iliac fossa and the breech is felt in the other.",,C,6065-3803.PNG;6065-3802.PNG
Q11,A primi at term presented with labor pain and multiple painful vesicular lesions on her vulva. No rashes were found on other parts of the body. what will be the management of this case?,"a)Acyclovir and elective cesarean section
b)Acyclovir and induction of labor
c)spontaneous delivery
d)Antiviral and normal vaginal delivery","The given clinical scenario of a primi in labor pain with multiple, painful vesicular lesions on her vulva is suggestive of an active herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Management involves the    administration of acyclovir and elective cesarean section.
HSV infection in pregnancy can be caused by either HSV-1 or HSV-2 and transmitted by sexual contact. The infection can be primary, nonprimary, first episode, and recurrent.
HSV infection (both HSV 1 and 2) during pregnancy has a risk of vertical transmission of the infection to the fetus. The risk is higher in the primary than in the recurrent infection. The
maximum risk of fetal infection is during labor, although it can occur in utero and post-natally from direct contact.



suspicious lesions should be sent for PCR testing or culture. Antiviral treatment with acyclovir   should be given if found positive. women with no active genital lesions, asymptomatic, or those with active lesions in non-genital areas can undergo normal labor and delivery.
Management of HsV infection during pregnancy:
• oral acyclovir or valacyclovir for primary or recurrent infections during pregnancy.
• IV acyclovir followed by oral acyclovir for severe or disseminated infection
• oral analgesics or topical anesthetics for pain relief
• Catheterization for urinary retention
Cesarean delivery reduces the risk of vertical transmission during labor and is indicated in:
• Cases of active genital lesions - both primary and recurrent
• Prodromal symptoms like vulval itching or burning
other options:
option B: The presene of active lesions is a contraindication for induction of labor.
option C: spontaneous delivery is contraindicated in the presence of active lesions.
option D: Even after treatment with acyclovir, normal delivery is not indicated owing to the risk of dormant viral transmission to the fetus.",,A,
Q12,"A 3o-year-old married woman came for an infertility evaluation. on performing further
investigations, intramural fibroids of sizes 7x5cm and 5x3cm were seen at the right and left cornual ends of the uterus. Her husband's semen analysis was found to be normal. what is  the appropriate management of this case?","a)uterine artery embolization
b)Myomectomy
c)Artificial reproductive techniques
d)GnRH analogues","The most appropriate management for a woman with infertility due to intramural fibroids at both the cornual ends of the uterus is myomectomy. The infertility, in this case, is due to the fibroids     blocking the right and left cornua of the uterus.
Myomectomy refers to the removal of fibroids and preserving the uterus. It is indicated in women presenting with infertility, those who desire pregnancy, or those who wish to retain the uterus.
Intracavitary fibroids can be resected via the hysteroscopic approach, while subserosal or intramural fibroids require laparotomy or laparoscopic myomectomy.
other options:
option A: uterine artery embolization is not done in this case, as it may decrease fertility, as a
result of pelvic adhesions. It is a technique in which polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), gel foam particles, or metal coils are injected into the uterine arteries. This embolization reduces vascularity and the
size of the fibroid. It is best suited to control menorrhagia in multiparous women.
option C: Artificial reproductive techniques are not indicated in this case as infertility is seen to    be due to the fibroids blocking the cornual ends of the uterus. However, it may be considered at a later stage.
option D: GnRH analogs when used for 6 months, can reduce the tumor size by targeting the
growth effects of estrogen and progesterone. It can be used in women with infertility caused by     cornual fibroids. They are often used preoperatively to reduce the size of the fibroid and facilitate a hysteroscopic approach to surgery. However, it is expensive and can cause menopausal
symptoms if used for &gt;6 months. Fibroids are known to regrow 3-4 months after stopping the



therapy.",,B,
Q13,"A 28-year-old married woman who is anxious to conceive presents with copious vaginal
discharge, without any itching. Her last menstrual period was 13 days ago. what is the cause of her vaginal discharge?","a)candidiasis
b)Bacterial vaginosis
c)Trichomoniasis
d)Physiological","The given clinical scenario of a young woman with copious, non-pruritic (without itching) vaginal discharge occurring 13 days after menstrual period (period of ovulation) is most likely to be
leucorrhoea (physiological).
The term leucorrhoea can be used in conditions where normal vaginal secretion is increased in amount. An increase in this normal vaginal secretion develops physiologically:
• At puberty
• At ovulation
• During pregnancy
• During the premenstrual phase, occasionally
It may be cervical or vaginal in origin. A speculum examination of the vagina can distinguish between the two. If the discharge is cervical in origin, an excessive mucoid discharge will be   visible at the external os.
Normal discharge appears clear or white, without any odor or itching, and will have a pH of
3.8-4.2.
other options:
option A: candidiasis is caused by infection with candida albicans and presents with pruritus,
burning, and dysuria with vulvar erythema, edema, and excoriations. A curdy white discharge will be present.
option B: Bacterial vaginosis is caused by an alteration in the normal vaginal flora and
presents without itching and a malodorous grey-white discharge. It is diagnosed using Amsel's criteria, where at least three of the four following criteria should be present to confirm the
diagnosis:
• Homogenous vaginal discharge
• vaginal pH &gt; 4.5
• Amine-like odor on adding KoH (whiff test positive)
• clue cells (&gt;2o% of cells)
option c: Trichomoniasis is caused by Trichomonas vaginalis and presents with a copious, frothy, offensive yellow-green discharge with vaginal soreness or irritation and urinary frequency. on
examination, the vagina looks red and inflamed. The inflamed cervix looks like a strawberry with punctate hemorrhagic spots.",,D,
Q14,A patient developed atonic postpartum hemorrhage after a normal vaginal delivery. she was   shifted to the oT and the obstetrician planned ligation of vessels to arrest the bleeding. what is the order of ligation of the blood vessels supplying the uterus?,"a)uterine artery - ovarian artery - Internal iliac artery
b)uterine artery - ovarian artery- External iliac artery
c)uterine artery - ovarian artery - vaginal artery
d)uterine artery - pudendal artery - vaginal artery","The order of ligation of vessels to arrest bleeding in atonic postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the uterine artery - ovarian artery - internal iliac artery.
The ascending branch of the uterine artery is ligated between the upper and lower segments of the uterus, at the lateral border. If the bleeding continues, the ovarian and uterine artery anastomosis is ligated just below the ovarian ligament. If the bleeding still persists, the anterior division of the  internal iliac artery is ligated 5 cm distal to the common iliac bifurcation.
unilateral or bilateral ligation of the internal iliac artery ligation causes a reduction in the pulse
pressure in the arteries distal to the ligation. This increases the chances of hemostasis via pressure and clot formation.
surgical methods to control PPH are outlined as stepwise uterine devascularization procedures:
• compression sutures: B-Lynch suture
• Ligation of uterine arteries
• Ligation of ovarian and uterine anastomosis
• Ligation of internal iliac artery
• Angiographic embolization of the bleeding vessel
Pelvic packing (usually done prior to embolization) and hysterectomy are other surgical methods employed to control PPH.",,A,6068-3804.PNG
Q15,"A teenage patient presented with a history of dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain. on ultrasonography, a transverse vaginal septum was seen. what is the most common
complication that can be seen in this patient?","a)Endometriosis
b)Tubo-ovarian abscess
c)Dermoid cyst
d)Theca lutein cyst","The most common complication that can be seen in this patient is endometriosis.
Transverse vaginal septum leads to obstructed flow of menstrual blood. This may lead to
retrograde menstruation, which increases the likelihood of the development of endometriosis, according to sampson's theory of endometriosis.



Transverse vaginal septum occurs as a result of the failure of Müllerian duct fusion or failure     of vaginal plate canalization. It may be obstructive or non-obstructive. The commonest site of a transverse septum is the junction between the upper and middle third of the vagina.
patients with an obstructive or imperforate vaginal septum present with symptoms similar to the   imperforate hymen. symptoms include amenorrhoea, cyclical abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, and a palpable pelvic mass. The vagina may appear shortened and the cervix may not be
identifiable. secondary sexual characteristics appear normal. The diagnosis can be confirmed with ultrasound or MRI.
There is an increased risk of endometriosis. other complications such as pyomucocolpos, pyometra, and pyosalpinges can also develop in infants with obstructive vaginal septums.
Treatment is by manual dilatation of the perforation or surgical excision of the septum.
other options:
option B: Tubo-ovarian abscess develops in pelvic inflammatory disease.
option C: Dermoid cysts are cystic ovarian tumors that are often associated with mucinous cystadenomas.
option D: Theca lutein cysts are found in association with hydatidiform moles, choriocarcinoma, and gonadotropin or clomiphene citrate therapy. They regress with the management of the mole  and choriocarcinoma and discontinuation of gonadotropin therapy.",,A,
Q16,"A 28-year old pregnant woman came for a routine antenatal check-up in her second
trimester. Four years back, she delivered 2 healthy full-term twins. what would her obstetric score be?","a)G2P2
b)G3P2
c)G2P1
d)G3P1","The obstetric score of a pregnant woman who previously delivered twins would be G2p1 (gravida
2 para 1).
The term gravida refers to the number of times the woman has been pregnant, irrespective of     whether it crossed the period of viability. The current pregnancy is included in this count. since she has been pregnant once before with twins and is currently pregnant now, gravida will be 2.
The term para refers to the number of previous pregnancies reaching a period of viability
(gestation of 28 weeks). It does not increase to a higher number if multiples (twins/triplets) are delivered in a given pregnancy and still count as one birth. A current pregnancy, if any, is not    included in this count. Therefore, para here will be 1 since she had one birth of twins and the    present pregnancy is not counted.
Both gravidity and parity refer to the pregnancies and not the fetuses.
Note: The period of viability is when the fetus is capable of independent existence. The WHo defines it to be 24 weeks while the Indian definition is 28 weeks.",,C,
Q17,"A 27-year-old woman who is on oral contraceptive pills for contraception has forgotten to take her pills on 4 different days in the last 2 weeks. she presents to the primary health    center, asking for advice. what would you suggest to her?","a)Take 4 pills now, continue the schedule, use barrier method of contraception
b)Take 1 pill now, continue the schedule, and use barrier method of contraception
c)Take 1 pill now, use barrier method, and consider emergency contraception in case of recent intercourse
d)Discard the pack, start a new pack with alternate method of contraception","A woman who has missed 4 oral contraceptive pills in the last two weeks should take one
hormonal pill as soon as possible and finish all hormonal pills in the pack as scheduled, throw away the 7 non-hormonal pills in a 28-pill pack and start a new pack the next day.



If any non-hormonal pills were missed, she can discard the remaining pills. start the new pack of oral contraceptives and continue taking as usual.
If she vomits within 2 hours of taking a pill, another pill from the pack should be taken as soon as possible. After that, continue taking the pills as scheduled. If the vomiting or diarrhea persists for  &gt;2 days, follow the instructions for 1 or 2 missed pills as mentioned above.
The contraceptive method should be discontinued and changed in the following situations:
• unexplained or prolonged heavy vaginal bleeding that suggests an underlying condition not related to the method
• starting anticonvulsant medication or treatment with rifampicin
• Migraines
• Non-ambulatory conditions lasting for &gt;1 week like major surgery, leg in a cast, etc. combined oral contraceptives can be restarted 2 weeks after ambulation.
• suspected heart or liver disease, hypertension, deep vein thrombosis, stroke, breast cancer, diabetes, or gall bladder disease

Missed pills	Management
Missed 1 or 2 pills/ started ne w pack 1 or 2 days late?	You have two options: take o   ne hormonal pill right away,   or take two pills at your usua  l scheduled time.The risk of p regnancy is minimal to none.

Q18,"A 3o-year-old female patient, on treatment for infertility, came with 6 weeks of amenorrhea, abdominal pain, and mild vaginal bleeding. Her beta hcG level was 28oo mIU/mL. on
ultrasound, a 3cm mass was seen in the left adnexa. It contained a gestational sac with no fetal cardiac activity. what is the most appropriate management for this patient?","a)Expectant management
b)single dose methotrexate
c)salpingectomy
d)Milking of the tube","A patient on infertility treatment, with 6 weeks of amenorrhea, abdominal pain, and vaginal
bleeding with beta hcG levels of 28oo mIU/mL, and a gestational sac in the left adnexa points to the diagnosis of unruptured ectopic pregnancy and the most appropriate management is
single-dose methotrexate.
A pregnancy is considered ectopic if implantation occurs at a site outside the uterine cavity. The majority of ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube, the ampulla being the most common site.
Management of ectopic pregnancy:
Expectant management: Ectopic pregnancies measuring &lt;3 cm and with declining beta hcG levels initially &lt;15oo mIU/mL may resolve without intervention and can be managed
expectantly.
Medical management with single or multiple-dose methotrexate is preferred if:
• Hemodynamic stability
• serum beta-hcG ≥15oo mIU/ml and ≤5ooo mIU/mL
• Mean sac diameter &lt;3.5cm with no fetal cardiac activity detected on transvaginal ultrasound.
• patients are willing and able to comply with post-treatment follow-up and have access to   emergency medical services within a reasonable time frame in case of a deterioration in the clinical status.
Methotrexate(MTX) can be given as a single IM dose of 5o mg/m2 or as a multiple-dose regimen of 1mg/kg on days 1, 3, 5, and 7.
surgical management with salpingectomy or salpingostomy is done when:
• criteria for expectant and medical management are not met
• Gestational sac &gt;3.5 cm
• Fetal cardiac activity present
• Beta hcG &gt; 5ooo mIU/mL
• significant pain and hemoperitoneum
• Failure of expectant or medical management
• clinical status of patient warrants urgent intervention
• Doubtful compliance with medical management
Milking of the tube through the fimbriae carries a high risk of bleeding, damage to the tube, the persistence of trophoblastic tissue, and recurrence of ectopic pregnancy.",,B,
Q19,A 3o-year-old woman on oral contraceptives for the past 6 months presents with 6 weeks of   amenorrhea. what would be the best method of assessing the gestational age of this patient?,"a)crown rump length by UsG
b)Adding 28o days to the LMP
c)Fundus examination
d)Adding 256 days to the LMP","The best method of assessing the gestational age of a patient on oral contraceptives with 6 weeks of amenorrhea is by measuring the crown-rump length (cRL) using ultrasonography.



Gestational age refers to the duration of pregnancy calculated from the first day of the LMP. It is usually expressed in weeks. Following the use of oral contraceptives, ovulation may have been
later than 2 weeks after the LMP. Therefore, gestational age calculated with the help of LMP will be inaccurate.
First-trimester ultrasound measurement of CRL is the best method to assess gestational age. It is measured from the vertex to the coccyx.
• CRL (in mm) + 6.5 = gestational age in weeks (or)
• CRL (in mm) + 42 days = gestational age in days.
CRL measurement is shown in the image below:


ultrasonographic parameters for estimation of the gestational age according to the trimester are as follows:
other options:
option B: Adding 28o days to the LMP will provide the expected delivery date (EDD). Adding 9      months + 7 days to the LMP or 28o days to the LMP is Naegele’s formula for calculating the EDD.
option C: Measurement of fundal height in cm (with a variation of 1-2cm) is roughly equal to the  gestational age in weeks, after 24 weeks of pregnancy. This is measured from the superior border of the symphysis pubis to the top of the uterine fundus when the bladder is empty.
