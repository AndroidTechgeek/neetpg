Question 1,calculate the therapeutic index of a drug whose dose-response curves are plotted as shown below:,"a) 1
b) 2
c) 4
d) 8","The therapeutic index is 4.
In the above graph,
Median lethal dose (LD5o) = 4oo
Median effective dose (ED5o) = 1oo
Therapeutic index (TI) = LD5o/ED5o.
Hence,
Therapeutic index (TI ) = 4oo/1oo = 4
Clinically, the therapeutic range bound by the dose that produces the minimal therapeutic effect and the dose that produces the maximal acceptable adverse effect is more relevant.",1080-752.PNG,C,IMAGE Q
Question 2,which of the following statements is true regarding the dose-response curve shown in the image below?,"a) C is competitive antagonist
b) C is more potent than A
c) B is more potent than A
d) B is competitive antagonist","In the above image, drug B is a competitive antagonist.
In competitive antagonism, the DRC is shifted to the right whereas in non-competitive antagonism the DRC is flattened.
Thus in the above image Drug B is the Competitive antagonist while drug C is the non-competitive antagonist.
Potency:
• It is defined as the amount of drug needed to produce a given response.
• A highly potent drug evokes a given response at low concentrations and vice-versa.
• The more the curve is on the left in a dose-response curve (DRC), the greater is its potency.
• Thus, in the above image, the potency is drug A > drug C > drug B.
Efficacy:
• It is defined as the maximum effect produced by the drug.
• It expresses the effect produced by the receptors when bound by a certain drug.
• In the log dose-response curve, the perpendicular height represents the drug efficacy.
• Thus, in the above image, the efficacy is drug A 〓 drug B > drug C.",1081-753.PNG,D,IMAGE Q
Question 3,which of the following antiglaucoma medications is unsafe in infants?,"a) Timolol
b) Brimonidine
c) Latanoprost
d) Dorzolamide","The use of brimonidine is unsafe in infants. It is an alpha-2 agonist that can cross the blood-brain barrier. This may result in CNS depression and apnoea in neonates. Therefore it is contraindicated in children less than 2 years.
α2 agonists, through the activation of G-protein coupled receptor activation, inhibit the activity of adenylate cyclase. This reduces cAMP and hence reduces aqueous humor production by ciliary action.",,B,
Question 4,Apparent volume of distribution of a drug is very high (6L/kg). which of the following is true regarding the distribution of that drug?,"a) Highly bound to plasma proteins
b) Confined to vascular compartment
c) sequestered in body tissues
d) Both A and B","In the present case, the volume of distribution of the drug is 6L/kg (42o L in a normal adult with reference weight 7okg) which is very high when compared to the total body water of 42L. Therefore, it can be implied that the drug is having high sequestration in tissues.
The apparent volume of distribution (vd) is an imaginary volume throughout which the drug is distributed if the plasma concentration remains constant throughout.
vd 〓 Dose administered Iv/ plasma concentration
The difference in the volume of distribution based on drug type:
• Low vd
• Restricted to the intravascular compartment
• seen in drugs with high molecular weight (e.g., heparin) or high protein binding (e.g., warfarin - 9.8L)
• Medium vd
• Lipid insoluble drugs (e.g., gentamicin - 2OL) do not enter the cells and are distributed in the extracellular fluid volume
• small water-soluble molecules (e.g., ethanol - 42L) are distributed in the total body water
• High vd
• sequestered and accumulated in the tissues
• small lipophilic molecules (e.g., chloroquine - 13OOOL)",,C,

Question 19,what is the drug used to differentiate myasthenia gravis from cholinergic crisis?,"a) obidoxime
b) Edrophonium
c) Donepezil
d) Atropine","The drug used to differentiate myasthenia gravis from a cholinergic crisis is edrophonium.
Muscle weakness is a common presentation in patients with myasthenia gravis and cholinergic crisis (excessive dose of anti-ChE drugs). Intravenous injection of edrophonium improves muscular weakness in a patient with myasthenia gravis and not in a case of cholinergic crisis.
The test used for this differentiation is known as the edrophonium test.
Initially, 2 mg is administered; if improvements of symptoms do not occur within 45 seconds, an additional 8 mg can be administered. Improvement of strength is a positive test for myasthenia gravis.",,B,

Question 21,The best approach in the treatment of chronic SIADH is ______,"a) Tolvaptan
b) Reducing fluid intake to <5oo ml per day
c) Demeclocycline
d) Fludrocortisone","The best approach in the treatment of chronic SIADH is the oral administration of a vaptan like tolvaptan, which is a selective V2 receptor antagonist. This increases urinary water excretion by blocking the antidiuretic effect of AVP.
other treatment options for chronic SIADH include:
• Fluid intake < 5oo ml/day
• Demeclocycline
• Fludrocortisone
Increased thirst is a frequently observed characteristic of hyponatremia in SIADH. Fluid restriction is usually a burden to the patient. It is unreliable, impractical, and slow to work. As thirst is particularly difficult to suppress, water restriction in SIADH frequently leads to non-compliance in the long run. vaptans would be especially suited for the treatment of these patients. Serum sodium concentrations are also corrected by vaptans and hence, vaptans substantially improve the quality of life in these patients.",,A,
Question 22,Intravenous mannitol is used in ____?,"a) Pulmonary edema
b) congestive cardiac failure
c) Acute kidney injury with anuria
d) Glaucoma","Intravenous mannitol is used for the treatment of acute attacks of glaucoma.
