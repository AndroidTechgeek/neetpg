Q1,De Quervain’s disease classically affects :,"a)Extensor pollicis longus and abductor pollicis longus
b)Extensor pollicis longus and abductor pollicis brevis
c)Extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis brevis
d)Extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus","De Quervain's disease classically affects extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus.
De Quervain's disease is a stenosing tenosynovitis of the extensor tendons of the first dorsal
compartment, namely extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) and abductor pollicis longus (APL). It
involves noninflammatory thickening of both the tendons and the tunnel or sheath through which they pass. This condition is prominent among females, especially women of childbearing age.



key diagnostic factors:
• History of joint overuse at home or at work.
• Pain and tenderness at the tip of the radial styloid.
• Positive Finkelstein test: The examiner grasps the thumb of the patient and abducts the hand towards the ulnar side. This causes severe pain over the tip of the styloid process


Treatment in most patients includes conservative management with splinting and steroid
injections. only a few patients require surgical release of the 1st dorsal compartment (housing the APL and EPB tendons).",,D,5301-3349.PNG
Q2,You are an intern in the casualty. For which of the following patients will you need to urgently call the orthopedic resident on call?,"a)patient with recurrent shoulder dislocation
b)patient with a fractured arm with capillary refill time of less than 3 seconds in his fingers
c)patient with a fractured arm with a 1o cm long incision over the arm
d)patient with a fractured arm with capillary refill time of 5 seconds in his fingers","A patient with a fractured arm and a prolonged capillary refill time of 5 seconds in his fingers requires urgent evaluation and intervention by an orthopedic resident.
The capillary refill time is a simple clinical test used to evaluate peripheral circulation and assess   blood flow to tissues. It can be assessed by applying pressure to the skin of the heel or toe pulp for approximately 5 seconds, causing blanching, and then releasing the pressure to allow the color to   return. A capillary refill time of less than 3 seconds is considered normal, indicating good blood
perfusion and adequate circulation.
In this patient with a fractured arm, a capillary refill time of 5 seconds suggests compromised
blood flow to the fingers, which could be indicative of a potential vascular injury or compartment syndrome. Both of these conditions are surgical emergencies and require immediate attention to  prevent further damage and ensure proper blood supply to the affected limb.
while the other patients should also be evaluated by an orthopedic resident, they do not present an immediate life-threatening situation.",,D,
Q3,which of the following is not associated with sprengel deformity?,"a)Diastematomyelia
b)klippel-Feil syndrome
c)Dextrocardia
d)congenital scoliosis","Dextrocardia is not associated with sprengel deformity.
sprengel deformity is the congenital elevation of the scapula. It is characterized by an elevated
shoulder on the affected side, with an abnormally high, smaller, and prominent scapula. The neck appears shorter, and there may be kyphosis or scoliosis of the upper thoracic spine. while
shoulder movements are painless, abduction and elevation may be limited due to scapular fixation.
Abnormalities associated with sprengel deformity include:
• klippel-Feil syndrome
• kyphosis or scoliosis
• cervical rib
• omovertebral bar (a bony bridge between the scapula and the cervical spine)
• spina bifida
• Diastematomyelia (congenitally split spinal cord)
• Torticollis
• Renal abnormalities

Q4,what is the most common bone to be fractured in children?,"a)Distal forearm bones
b)Humerus
c)clavicle
d)carpals","The most common bones to be fractured in children are the distal forearm bones.
The distal radius is the most commonly fractured bone in childhood. It is more commonly fractured than the clavicle.
The clavicle is most commonly fractured during birth.",,A,
Q5,"A patient has a history of a road traffic accident 2 years back, and has developed pain and
swelling now at the same site. His X-ray image is shown in the image given below. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)osteogenic sarcoma
b)Ewing's sarcoma
c)chronic osteomyelitis
d)Multiple myeloma","The given clinical scenario of a patient with a history of an accident 2 years ago, experiencing symptoms of pain and swelling at the site of injury, and an X-ray of the lower limb revealing
sequestrum and involucrum in the tibia, strongly suggests a diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis.


chronic osteomyelitis may occur by direct inoculation of the infective organism during trauma (like road traffic accidents). The infection continues to thrive within the bone leading to
alternating quiescent and flare-up stages of chronic osteomyelitis.
sequestrum is a piece of dead bone. It is formed when a fragment of bone gets separated from the healthy bone due to necrosis. It varies in size from a spicule to a large fragment and acts as a
nidus for infection. It leads to abscess and persistent pus discharge in the bone. sinus tracts are formed when the abscess from the infected bone drains out through the skin.
The involucrum is the dense new sclerotic bone surrounding the sequestrum. It is formed from   deep layers of stripped periosteum. cloacae are the perforations in the involucrum. Pus and tiny spicules of bone may be discharged through them.
The radiograph below shows sequestrum, involucrum and cloacae:





option A: osteogenic sarcoma characteristically shows the sun-burst appearance and codman's triangle, as shown below.


option B: Ewing's sarcoma shows an onion-skin appearance of the periosteum, as shown below.





option D: Multiple myeloma shows multiple punched-out lesions of the bone, as shown below.",5298-3347.PNG,C,5303-3351.PNG;5304-3353.PNG;5304-3352.PNG;5305-3355.PNG;5305-3354.PNG

Q7,The pathognomonic sign of a simple bone cyst is ______,"a)Fallen fragment sign
b)scalloping of cortex
c)Never breaches physis
d)Central radiolucent lesion","The fallen fragment sign is the pathognomonic radiographic sign of a simple bone cyst.
simple bone cysts typically occur during the first two decades of life, predominantly between the ages of 4 and 1o, with a 2:1 male preponderance. They are benign unilocular cysts filled with
straw-colored serosanguinous fluid. The most common site for these cysts is the proximal
humerus. Although they are usually asymptomatic, they can lead to pathological fractures through the cyst wall, resulting in pain and swelling. Additionally, due to their proximity to the growth
plate, the cysts may cause growth disturbances.
on an X-ray, a bone fragment may be observed resting in a dependent portion of the cyst. This
finding, known as the fallen fragment or fallen leaf sign, is considered pathognomonic of a simple bone cyst. Another variant of this sign is the trapdoor sign, in which a periosteal hinge prevents     the fragment from falling down and enables it to change position with the patient's movement.
The radiograph below shows the fallen fragment sign:",,A,5306-3356.PNG
Q8,which of the following is incorrect about perilunate dislocation?,"a)Lunate is dislocated anteriorly but the rest of the carpals remains in position
b)Lunate remains in position but rest other dislocate dorsally
c)Involves median nerve injury
d)Tavernier’s manoeuvre is used for closed reduction","Among the given options, statement A is incorrect.
A fall on a dorsiflexed hand may tear the tough ligaments that normally bind the carpal bones,  leading to dislocations. In peri-lunate dislocation, the lunate remains in position in the lunate    fossa of the distal radius but the rest of the carpals dislocate dorsally. It is frequently associated with compression of the median nerve.
prompt reduction reduces swelling and potential damage to the median nerve. The Tavernier
maneuver is the most commonly used method of closed reduction. It involves locking the capitate into the distal concavity of the lunate. If the injury cannot be reduced using this method, urgent    reduction in the theater should be performed.
In lunate dislocation, the lunate dislocates anteriorly while the rest of the carpal bones remain in place.",,A,5307-3357.PNG
Q9,Identify the carpal bone that is most commonly fractured after fall on an outstretched hand.,"a)A
b)C
c)B
d)D","The scaphoid (labelled as A) is the most commonly fractured carpal bone after a fall on an outstretched hand.
It is more susceptible to fracture because it lies obliquely across the two rows of carpal bones. It    also lies along the line of loading (i.e, in the line of weight transmission) between the forearm and thumb. A combination of forced carpal movement and compression, such as in a fall on the
dorsiflexed (outstretched) hand, exerts severe stress on the scaphoid making it liable to fracture.
Due to its blood supply originating from the dorsal distal pole, the scaphoid's proximal pole possesses a poor blood flow, making it less prone to heal and resulting in non-union.",5299-3348.PNG,A,5308-3358.PNG
Q10,"For hypertrophic non-union following a fracture, the most appropriate treatment would be","a)stabilization
b)Bone grafting
c)stabilization and bone grafting
d)None of the above","In cases of hypertrophic non-union following a fracture, stabilization alone has the potential to induce union.
Non-union following a fracture occurs when the healing process fails to progress, resulting in a failure to unite. There are two primary types of non-union:
• Hypertrophic - where callus formation is present but does not bridge the fracture site
• Atrophic - characterized by minimal or no attempt at callus formation
For hypertrophic non-union without deformity, conservative treatment using functional bracing   or rigid fixation alone (internally or externally) can promote union. However, in cases of atrophic non-union, fixation alone is insufficient, requiring the excision of fibrous tissues in the fracture     gap and sclerotic bone ends, followed by the application of bone grafts around the fracture.",,A,
