Q1,According to myogenic hypothesis of renal autoregulation the afferent arterioles contract in response to stretch-induced by______,"a) NO
b) Noradrenaline
c) Opening of calcium channels
d) Adenosine","The afferent arterioles contract in response to stretch induced by the opening of calcium channels. The mechanism is called myogenic autoregulation of renal blood flow and GFR.
The stretch of the vascular wall allows increased movement of calcium ions from the extracellular fluid into the cells, causing them to contract. This contraction prevents excessive stretch of the vessel. This prevents excessive increase of renal blood flow and GFR by raising vascular resistance.
This mechanism may be more important in protecting the kidney from hypertension-induced injury.",,C,509-475.PNG
Q2,"According to Herrington classification, the decerebrate rigidity is characterized by all except ______","a) Rigidity occurs in all the muscles of the body
b) Increase in the rate of discharge of the ■ efferent neuron
c) Increased excitability of the motor neuron pool
d) Decerebration produces no phenomenon akin to spinal shock","In decerebrate rigidity, there is rigidity in extensor muscles of all the four extremities (not all muscles of the body).
Decerebration is a complete transection of the brain stem between the superior and inferior colliculi. This lesion interrupts all input from the cortex and red nucleus. The excitatory and inhibitory reticulospinal pathways remain intact.
The dominance of drive from ascending sensory pathways to the excitatory reticulospinal pathway leads to hyperactivity in extensor muscles in all four extremities which are called decerebrate rigidity.",,A,
Q3,which of the following is true for decorticate rigidity?,"a) It is produced by the removal of cerebral cortex and basal ganglia
b) Flexion of lower limbs and extension of upper limbs occurs
c) Rigidity is pronounced
d) It is characterized by flexion of upper limbs and extension of lower limbs","Decorticate rigidity is characterized by flexion of the upper extremities at the elbow and extensor hyperactivity in the lower extremities.
Removal of the cerebral cortex (decortication) produces decorticate rigidity.
The flexion can be explained by active rubrospinal excitation of flexor muscles in the upper extremities; the hyperextension of lower extremities is due to the same changes that occur after midcollicular decerebration.",,D,510-476.PNG
Q4,"Acid Citrate Dextrose (ACD), used to store blood, preserves the RBCs for a period of 21 days. The storage period when adding phosphate alone and when adding adenine and phosphate together to ACD would respectively be?","a) 35 days and 42 days
b) 21 days and 35 days
c) 28 days and 45 days
d) 35 days and 28 days","The storage period when adding phosphate alone to ACD would be 21 days and when adding adenine and phosphate together would be 35 days.
when adding phosphate to ACD, Citrate Phosphate Dextrose (CPD) is formed – It has a storage period of 21 days. There is no change in the shelf life as phosphate only increases the 2,3 DPG levels of the stored blood.
when adding both phosphate and adenine to ACD, Citrate Phosphate Dextrose Adenine (CPDA-1) is formed. It has a storage period of 35 days. It increases the shelf life by improving ATP synthesis of RBCs.
using additive solutions containing saline, adenine, and glucose, with or without mannitol (SAGM) decreases RBC hemolysis, thus increasing the storage period to 42 days.",nan,B,499-471.PNG

Q7,Lesion in the medial lemniscus at the level of pons causes which of the following?,"a) pain and temperature loss in the same side
b) pain and temperature loss in the opposite side
c) Loss of tactile and proprioception on the same side
d) Loss of tactile and proprioception on the opposite side","Lesion in the medial lemniscus at the level of pons causes loss of tactile and proprioception on the opposite side.
Fibers of medial lemniscus ascend ipsilaterally in the dorsal columns of the spinal cord to the medulla, where they synapse in the gracilus and cuneate nuclei.
The second-order neurons from these nuclei cross the midline and ascend in the medial lemniscus to end in the contralateral ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nucleus and related specific sensory relay nuclei of the thalamus.",,D,
Q8,which neurotransmitter is responsible for anterograde dilatation of the small intestine?,"a) vIp
b) Acetylcholine
c) substance P
d) serotonin","VIP is responsible for anterograde dilatation of the small intestine.
Peristalsis involves the contraction of a segment of intestine behind the bolus of food and relaxation of a segment of the intestine in front of the bolus of food.
cholinergic neurons passing in anterograde direction produce NO and VIP which cause relaxation of a segment of the intestine in front of the bolus.
cholinergic neurons passing in retrograde direction produce substance P and acetylcholine which cause contraction of a segment of the intestine behind the bolus.",,A,512-478.PNG
Q9,Reflex responsible for tachycardia during right atrial distension is:,"a) J reflex
b) cushing reflex
c) Bezold jarisch reflex
d) Bainbridge reflex","Reflex responsible for tachycardia during right atrial distension is Bainbridge reflex.
The stretch receptors of the atria that elicit the Bainbridge reflex transmit their afferent signals through the vagus nerves to the medulla of the brain.
Then efferent signals are transmitted back through vagal and sympathetic nerves to increase heart rate and strength of heart contraction.",,D,
Q10,Testosterone production is mainly contributed by ______,"a) Leydig cells
b) sertoli cells
c) seminiferous tubules
d) Epidydmis","Testosterone production is mainly contributed by Leydig cells.
Testosterone is synthesized from cholesterol in the Leydig cells and also from androstenedione secreted by the adrenal cortex.
The diagnosis of testosterone deficiency should be made only on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with androgen deficiency, and consistently subnormal serum testosterone concentrations at 8 to 1o AM on three occasions.",,A,
Q11,what is the function of tubuloglomerular feedback?,"a) Regulate GFR
b) Decrease plasma sodium
c) Increase plasma volume
d) Decrease tubular secretion","Tubuloglomerular feedback regulates glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
As the rate of ■ow through the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and first part of the distal tubule increases, glomerular filtration in the same nephron decreases, and, conversely, a decrease in ■ow increases the GFR.",,A,

b) calcium
c) sodium
d) chlorine","potassium is involved in peripheral oxygen sensing chemoreceptors.
Type I glomus cells (carotid and aortic body) have o2-sensitive k+ channels, whose conductance is reduced in proportion to the degree of hypoxia.
This reduces the K+ efflux, depolarizing the cell and causing ca2+ in■ux.
The ca2+ influx triggers action potentials and consequent excitation of the afferent nerve endings.",,A,
Q19,Brown sequard syndrome is characterized by _____,"a) Fine touch lost on the opposite side
b) pain and temperature lost on the same side
c) pain and temperature loss on the opposite side
d) only pain lost on the same side","Hemisection of the spinal cord causes Brown- Séquard syndrome. The loss of the spinothalamic tract leads to contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation beginning one or two segments below the lesion.
The lesion to fasciculus gracilus or fasciculus cuneatus leads to ipsilateral loss of discriminative touch, vibration, and proprioception below the level of the lesion.
Damage to the corticospinal tract produces weakness and spasticity in certain muscle groups on the same side of the body.",,C,
