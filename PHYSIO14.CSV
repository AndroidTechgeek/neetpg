Question 1,which of the following are properties of ventricular cardiac muscle?,"a) 1,2
b) 1,2,3
c) 1,2,4
d) 1,2,3,4","All or none phenomenon, length tension relationship and long refractory period applies to cardiac muscles. cardiac muscle cannot be tetanized due to long refractory period.
In cardiac myocytes, depolarization proceeds rapidly and an overshoot of the zero potential is present. This is followed by a plateau before the membrane potential reaches the RMp (-9omv). This plateau phase lasts for 2oo msec or more. Repolarization is therefore not complete until contraction is 5o% completed.
phases of cardiac action potential
• o→ Depolarisation and overshoot-Due to opening of voltage-gated Na+ channels
• 1→ Initial rapid repolarization-Due to closure of Na+ channels and opening up of K+ channels
• 2→ plateau phase - Due to slow but prolonged opening of ca2+ channels
• 3→ Late rapid repolarization
• 4→ Baseline (RMp)
phases 3 and 4 are due closure of ca2+ channels and a slow, delayed increase of K+ efflux through K+ channels.
During phases o to 2 and about half of phase 3 of cardiac action potential, cardiac muscle cannot be excited again, that is, it is in its absolute refractory period. It remains relatively refractory until phase 4. Thus, cardiac muscle cannot be tetanized.",,B,655-562.PNG
Question 2,which of the following may lead to a decrease in GFR?,"a) Increase in renal blood flow
b) Decrease in glomerular oncotic pressure
c) Increase in glomerular hydrostatic pressure
d) Decrease in bowman capsule oncotic pressure","A decrease in bowman's capsule oncotic pressure would lead to a decrease in GFR.
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the volume of fluid filtered from the renal glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule per unit time.
The GFR is determined by sum of the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces across the glomerular membrane, which gives the net filtration pressure. It is dependant on Glomerular kf (glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient) also.
Mathematically, it can be expressed as follows:
GFR〓 kf [PG + πB -PB- πG]
Forces favoring Filtration
• PG: Glomerular hydrostatic pressure
• πB: Bowman’s capsule oncotic pressure
Forces opposing Filtration
• PB: Bowman’s capsule hydrostatic pressure
• πG: Glomerular capillary oncotic pressure
Factors that can increase the GFR are as follows:
• Increase in glomerular capillary filtration coefficient kf: This coefficient depends on the hydraulic conductivity and surface area of the glomerular capillaries.
• Decrease in Bowman's capsule hydrostatic pressure: conditions with urinary tract obstruction can lead to an increase in this pressure and a fall in GFR.
• Decrease in glomerular colloid osmotic pressure: Accumulation of plasma proteins that are not filtered from the blood contributes to this pressure and an increase reduces the further filtration and GFR. It is directly proportional to the following factors:Arterial plasma colloid osmotic pressure
• Filtration fraction",,D,
Question 3,which is the most potent naturally occurring estrogen?,"a) Estradiol
b) Estriol
c) Estrone
d) conjugated Estrogen","Estradiol is the most potent naturally occurring estrogen.
classic estrogens are c18 steroid compounds containing a phenolic ring. only three estrogens are present in significant quantities in the plasma of the human female—β-estradiol, estrone, and estriol.
The principal estrogen secreted by the ovaries is β-estradiol.
small amounts of estrone are also secreted, but most of this is formed in peripheral tissues from androgens secreted by the adrenal cortices and by ovarian thecal cells.
Estriol is a weak estrogen; it is an oxidative product derived from both estradiol and estrone, with the conversion occurring mainly in the liver.
The estrogenic potency of β-estradiol is 12 times that of estrone and 8o times that of estriol.
Hence, estradiol is the most potent natural form of estrogen.
In the liver, estradiol, estrone, and estriol are converted to inactive glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. All these compounds, along with other metabolites, are excreted in the urine.",,A,657-563.PNG
Question 4,which hormones are produced from the zones labelled in the image given?,"a) A-cortisol, B-aldosterone, C-androgens, D-epinephrine
b) A-epinephrine, B-cortisol, C-aldosterone, D-androgens
c) A-aldosterone, B-epinephrine, C-androgens, D-cortisol
d) A-aldosterone, B-cortisol, C-androgens, D-epinephrine","option D is the correct option. This is a section through an adrenal gland showing both the medulla and the zones of the cortex. Following are the zones of the cortex and medulla, and the hormones they secrete.
A – zona Glomerulosa – secretes mineralocorticoids (aldosterone)
B – zona Fasciculata – secretes glucocorticoids (cortisol, corticosterone)
c – zona Reticularis – secretes androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone)
D – Adrenal Medulla – produces catecholamines: Norepinephrine, Epinephrine, and Dopamine on histological examination, the different layers are identified as:
• outer zona glomerulosa - small, compact cells
• central zona fasciculata - larger lipid-rich cells arranged in radial columns
• Inner zona reticularis - pigmented, compact cells
• Adrenal medulla - thin layer of large chromaffin cells",643-552.PNG,D,
Question 5,Erythropoietin is produced by:,"a) 1 only
b) 2 only
c) 1,2
d) 1,2,3,4","Erythropoietin is produced mainly by kidney and liver.
In adults, approximately 85% of erythropoietin is produced by the kidneys, while 15% is synthesized by the liver. Both of these organs possess the mRNA necessary for erythropoietin production. Although erythropoietin can be found in the spleen and salivary glands, these tissues lack the mRNA required for its synthesis, indicating that they do not produce the hormone.
Erythropoietin is secreted by interstitial cells in the peri-tubular capillary bed of the kidneys and by perivenous hepatocytes in the liver. It is also generated in the brain, where it provides a safeguarding effect against excitotoxic harm caused by hypoxia; and in the uterus and oviducts, where it is stimulated by estrogen and seems to facilitate estrogen-driven angiogenesis.",,C,
Question 6,"EOG, EEG, and EMG of a patient are given respectively from above downwards. which stage of sleep does the marked area represent?","a) NREM I sleep
b) NREM II sleep
c) REM sleep
d) NREM III sleep","REM sleep is represented by the marked area in the given polysomnography.

Question 7,which of the following statements is incorrect regarding ABO blood grouping?,"a) Antibodies are naturally present since birth
b) The antigens are carbohydrate in nature
c) The antibodies are predominantly IgM
d) Antibodies are present only if antigens are absent","Antibodies are not present since birth. At 2 to 8 months after birth, an infant begins to produce agglutinins (antibodies).
In the absence of type A agglutinogen(antigen) in an individual's RBCs, antibodies called anti-A agglutinins form in the plasma. similarly, when type B agglutinogen is lacking in the RBCs, antibodies referred to as anti-B agglutinins develop in the plasma. Type A blood carries type A agglutinogens and anti-B agglutinins, while type B blood contains type B agglutinogens and anti-A agglutinins. Type AB blood possesses both A and B agglutinogens but no agglutinins. on the other hand, type o blood, which lacks agglutinogens, does have both anti-A and anti-B agglutinins.
The A and B antigens are complex oligosaccharides that differ in their terminal sugar. The agglutinins are gamma globulins produced by the bone marrow and lymph gland cells. Most of them are IgM and IgG immunoglobulin molecules.",,A,
Question 8,Identify the hormones marked in the image given,"a) A-somatostatin, B-GHRH, C-GH, D-IGF-1

d) A-GH, B-GHRH, C-IGF-1, D-somatostatin","In the given image, A: somatostatin, B: GHRH, C: GH, D: IGF-1
• Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) secreted from the hypothalamus acts on the anterior pituitary to release growth hormone.
• Growth hormone (GH) increases the circulating levels of IGF -1 which exerts its effect on the tissues.
• Ghrelin promotes the secretion of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary.
• somatostatin secreted from the hypothalamus is an inhibitory effect on the GH secretion from the anterior pituitary.
• similarly, IGF -1 exerts negative feedback on GH secretion and positive feedback on somatostatin secretion, which in turn inhibits GH secretion.",645-554.PNG,A,
Question 9,Identify the correct sequence.,"a) Protein kinase A » Adenylyl cyclase » cAMP
b) cAMP » Adenylyl cyclase » Protein kinase A
c) Adenylyl cyclase » cAMP » Protein kinase A
d) Protein kinase A » cAMP » Adenylyl cyclase","The correct sequence in Gs is adenylyl cyclase 》 cAMP 》 Protein kinase A.
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are cell membrane receptors that span across the membrane 7 times. They also serve as receptors for various peptide hormones, neurotransmitters and amino acids. subtypes of GPCRs are distinguished by their alpha subunits. The important subtypes of GPCRs are Gs, Gi, and Gq.
when hormones bind to the receptor, it enables the receptor to connect with a G protein. If the G protein activates the adenylyl cyclase-cAMP system, it is referred to as a Gs protein, indicating a stimulatory G protein. The Gs protein stimulates adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme located in the cell membrane, which then converts a small amount of cytoplasmic adenosine triphosphate into cAMP. This cAMP activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which phosphorylates specific proteins within the cell, initiating biochemical reactions that ultimately result in the cell’s response to the hormone.",,C,
Question 10,which among the following instruments is not used in the sahli's method of hemoglobin estimation?,"a) A
b) B
c) C
d) D","option D is RBC pipette, it is not used in sahli's method of hemoglobin estimation. The instruments used are comparator with brown glass standard(option A), graduated hemoglobin tube(option B), sahli's pipette (option C)and stirrer.
sahli's method of estimation of hemoglobin is based on colorimetric measurement of the intensity of color developed on the addition of dilute hydrochloric acid (N/1o HCl) reagent to the blood.
In sahli's method, hemoglobin is converted to acid hematin with the action of dilute hydrochloric acid (N/1o HCl). The brown color of the acid hematin is matched to its intensity with a standard brown glass comparator in a visual colorimeter called sahli’s colorimeter. It can be used to estimate oxyHb and reduced Hb.
sahli's method is a simple bedside test and is cost-effective. However, it has some disadvantages, which include visual errors, the inability to measure other forms of hemoglobin like carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and sulfhemoglobin, fading of the comparator over time, and the color of acid hematin fading quickly.
The visual error can be reduced by taking the average of three readings; first, when the color is slightly darker than the standard; second, when the color exactly matches the standard; and third, when the color is slightly lighter than the standard.",646-555.PNG,D,661-566.PNG
Question 11,which neurotransmitter is secreted by the SA node in response to increased blood pressure?,"a) Acetylcholine
b) Epinephrine
c) Norepinephrine
d) Dopamine","Acetylcholine is released in response to increased blood pressure.
In response to raised BP, there is inhibition of sympathetic system and activation of parasympathetic system. Acetylcholine is the universal neurotransmitter of PNS.
Baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the heart and the adventitia of the blood vessels. They are stimulated by the stretching of the walls of the blood vessels when there is an increased volume or blood pressure in the vessel. They are important in the immediate management of blood pressure. They are of two types: carotid sinus and aortic arch receptors (high-pressure regions) and cardiopulmonary receptors (low-pressure regions).
An increase in blood pressure stimulates the baroreceptors. These signals are transmitted through small Hering’s nerves to the glossopharyngeal nerves and then to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the medulla. These signals release glutamate and activate the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM). This in turn inhibits the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) considered the vasoconstrictor center for the brain and the heart.
Simultaneously, this pathway also excites the vagal parasympathetic center. The stimulation of the vagus results in a slowing of impulse generation in the SA node and a slowing of conduction velocity in the AV node.
These neural changes produce vasodilation, venodilation, hypotension, bradycardia, and a decrease in cardiac output.
• NTS: Nucleus Tractus Solitarius
• cvLM: caudal ventrolateral Medulla
• RvLM : Rostral ventrolateral Medulla (vasomotor center)
• cvc : cardiovagal center (cardioinhibitory center)
• IML: intermediolateral nucleus",,A,662-567.PNG
Question 12,Match the following hormones with their receptors.,"a) A-1, B-2, C-3, D-4
b) A-1, B-3, C-2, D-4
c) A-3, B-4, C-1, D-2
d) A-4, B-2, C-3, D-1","The correct answer is A-3, B-4, c-1, D-2.
Insulin binds to a receptor that has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. upon activation, the receptor phosphorylates itself and downstream signaling proteins. (A-3)
Acetylcholine acts on nicotinic receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels. Binding of acetylcholine opens the channel, allowing ion flow (e.g., Na■ or K■). (B-4)
Growth hormone binds to its receptor, which lacks intrinsic kinase activity but recruits Janus Kinase (JAK) to phosphorylate downstream proteins and activate the STAT (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription) pathway. (c-1)
Thyroxine (and its active form, T3) binds to intracellular nuclear receptors. These hormone-receptor complexes act as transcription factors, regulating gene expression directly in the nucleus. (D-2)

Question 13,The o2 saturation with respect to Po2 is shown by the curve marked as 5. what happens to the oxygen Hb dissociation curve on transfusion of stored RBCs?,"a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 1","when stored RBCs are transfused, the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve typically shifts to the left but still retains its sigmoid shape as represented by the curve marked as 2.
This is due to reduced levels of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) in stored red blood cells.
2,3-BPG is a metabolite in RBCs that binds to hemoglobin and reduces its affinity for oxygen.
During storage, metabolic processes in RBCs slow down, leading to a depletion of 2,3-BPG. Lower 2,3-BPG levels make hemoglobin hold onto oxygen more tightly, impairing oxygen delivery to tissues. Hence, this increases hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen, shifting the curve to the left.
other options:
option B and C: show a right shift to the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve.↑ in 2,3-BPG seen in increased anaerobic glycolysis leads to the right shift of the curve. Storage of blood causes depletion of 2,3-BPG, hence leading to left shift instead of right.",647-556.PNG,A,663-568.PNG
Question 14,Not seen in decompression sickness,"a) vision loss
b) Hearing loss
c) Hemodilution
d) Coagulopathy","Hemodilution is not seen in decompression sickness. Instead, hemoconcentration is seen in decompression sickness.
Hemodilution refers to the dilution of blood, usually due to excessive fluid intake or other medical conditions, but it is not a feature of decompression sickness.
Decompression sickness (DCS) is a condition that occurs when a person ascends too quickly after being exposed to high-pressure environments (such as deep-sea diving), causing nitrogen bubbles to form in the bloodstream and tissues.
other options:
option A: vision changes or loss can occur in DCS due to gas bubbles affecting the optic nerve or retinal circulation, leading to temporary or permanent vision impairment.
option B: Gas bubbles in DCS can also affect the auditory system, leading to hearing loss or tinnitus, a common feature of the condition.
option D: Decompression sickness can lead to coagulopathy, which refers to abnormal blood clotting due to the formation of nitrogen bubbles that disrupt the vascular system, potentially causing bleeding or clotting disorders.",,C,
Question 15,which of the following ovarian structures is responsible for the following finding?,"a) secondary follicle
b) Theca interna
c) Granulosa cell
d) corpus luteum","The ovarian structure responsible for the following finding is the corpus luteum.
The histological image shows a corkscrew appearance of the glands, and this is characteristic of the secretory phase of the endometrium in the menstrual cycle. This phase is stimulated by progesterone, which is secreted by the corpus luteum.
Endometrial Biopsy of the various stages of the ovarian cycle:
1. proliferative phase: The glands are simple, straight, and tubular glands. The lining of the glands shows pseudostratified columnar epithelium with mitotic figures, indicating active cell proliferation. The stroma is dense and compact, with numerous cells undergoing mitosis.
2. Early secretory phase: The initially straight glands begin to coil as the endometrium transitions into the secretory phase. Subnuclear vacuolation is seen in the epithelial cells of the endometrial glands, caused by the accumulation of glycogen at the base of the cells.
3. Late secretory phase: The glands become maximally tortuous and assume a distinctive ""saw-tooth"" appearance due to extreme coiling. They are filled with secretions rich in glycogen and glycoproteins, essential for supporting a potential embryo. The stroma is edematous.
other options:
option A: secondary follicle
The secondary follicle is a more advanced stage of follicular development following the primary follicle. It contains a fluid-filled cavity (antrum) surrounded by two layers: theca interna and theca externa.
option B and C: Theca interna and Granulosa cell
The theca interna is a layer of stromal cells just outside the basal lamina of the granulosa cells. They are composed of cuboidal endocrine cells with lipid droplets and abundant smooth endoplasmic reticulum, reflecting its role in steroidogenesis.
Granulosa cells line the interior of the follicle. cells are organized in layers, initially single-layered in primary follicles and multilayered in secondary follicles.",648-557.PNG,D,664-569.PNG
Question 16,which of the following does not form the inner component of photoreceptors?,"a) Mitochondria
b) Membranous disc
c) Golgi apparatus
d) Endoplasmic reticulum","Among the given options, the membranous disc does not form the inner component of photoreceptors but instead forms the outer component.
The other three options i.e., mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum form the inner component of photoreceptors.
photoreceptors (rods and cones) are specialized neurons in the retina with distinct structural components:
• outer segment: contains membranous discs that have photopigments (like rhodopsin in rods and photopsins in cones) essential for light detection.
• Inner segment: contains cellular organelles responsible for metabolism and protein synthesis, such as mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum.",,B,667-573.PNG
Question 17,which of the following does not stimulate catecholamine synthesis?,"a) Hyperglycemia
b) smoking
c) standing posture
d) Exercise","Hyperglycemia does not stimulate catecholamine synthesis. Instead, hypoglycemia stimulates catecholamine synthesis.
Catecholamine synthesis is primarily stimulated by various physiological stressors and factors that activate the sympathetic nervous system, such as physical exertion(exercise), changes in posture, or certain external stimuli like smoking.
other options:
option B: smoking stimulates catecholamine release through the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which increases catecholamines like adrenaline and norepinephrine.
option C: when a person stands up, it can lead to orthostatic hypotension, which triggers the release of catecholamines to help increase blood pressure and maintain adequate perfusion.
option D: Exercise stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and increases catecholamine production to support increased heart rate, blood pressure, and metabolic demands.",,A,
Question 18,"while collecting a blood sample for serum calcium, which is easily alterable, which of the following should be prevented to measure it accurately?","a) If a tourniquet is needed, tie and release as soon as the sample is collected.
b) collecting after exercise.
c) Making a fist is not recommended.
d) Not collecting samples from patients immobilized for long periods of time","Blood collection after exercise should be prevented to measure serum calcium accurately.
option A: A prolonged tourniquet is usually avoided while drawing blood for calcium measurements since hemoconcentration also leads to an increase in serum calcium levels. Hence, the tourniquet should be released as soon as the sample is collected.
option C: Fist-clenching or forearm exercise can lead to falsely elevated ionized (free) calcium levels. Hence, making a fist while blood collection is not recommended.
option D: staying immobilised for long periods of time increases bone resorption and increases calcium levels. Hence, do not collect blood samples for serum calcium estimation in patients who are immobilized for long periods.",,B,
Question 19,which receptor contributes to static 2 point discrimination?,"a) Merkel cell
b) Meissner corpuscle
c) pacinian corpuscle
d) All of them","Merkel cell contributes to static 2 point discrimination.
Merkel cells are responsible for static two-point discrimination. These cells are specialized for detecting pressure and texture and are involved in the detection of fine touch. They provide information about the spatial resolution of tactile stimuli, which is essential for static two-point discrimination, where the ability to differentiate between two distinct points of touch is tested.
Merkel cells are expanded dendritic endings in the epidermis of glabrous (non-hairy) skin. They respond to sustained pressure and touch. They are slowly adapting receptors.
static vs. Dynamic Two-point Discrimination
static: Measures the ability to distinguish stationary points; mediated by Merkel cells (slow-adapting receptors).
Dynamic: Measures the ability to distinguish moving points; mediated by Meissner corpuscles (fast-adapting receptors).
other options:
option B: Meissner corpuscle: Meissner corpuscles are dendrites encapsulated in the connective tissue beneath the epidermis of glabrous (non-hairy) skin. They respond to tap and flutter (low-frequency vibration - 5-4OHz). They are rapidly adapting receptors.
option C: pacinian corpuscle: pacinian corpuscles are the largest cutaneous mechanoreceptor. They are present in the dermis of glabrous (non-hairy) and hairy skin. A pacinian corpuscle consists of a nerve ending encapsulated by concentric layers of connective tissue, giving it an onion-like appearance. They respond to fast vibration (6O-5OOHz) and deep pressure. They are rapidly adapting receptors.",,A,668-574.PNG
Question 20,Mitochondrial sheaths are found in which part of the sperm?,"a) Tail
b) Middle piece
c) principal piece
d) connecting piece","Mitochondrial sheaths are found in the middle piece of the sperm.
The middle piece is the segment of the sperm located just behind the head and neck.
It contains a spiral arrangement of mitochondria, forming the mitochondrial sheath around the central axoneme.
These mitochondria generate ATP, which provides the energy required for the flagellar movement of the sperm, enabling motility.
other options:
option A: Tail: comprises the middle piece, principal piece, and end piece and is primarily responsible for motility.
option c: Principle piece: Longest part of the tail which contains fibrous sheaths around the axoneme but lacks mitochondria.
option D: connecting piece: Links the head of the sperm to the tail (neck region). Does not contain mitochondrial sheaths.",,B,669-575.PNG

Question 22,which of these drug transport systems do not require ATP?,"a) 1,2,3
b) 2,3,4
c) 3,4,5
d) 1,2,5","Paracellular transport, simple Diffusion and Facilitated diffusion do not require ATP as they are all passive transport mechanisms.
1: simple diffusion : simple diffusion is a passive transport mechanism where molecules (water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen) move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration and is not carrier mediated.
2: Paracellular : Paracellular transport involves movement of molecules through tight junctions between cells without the need for energy (ATP).
3: Facilitated diffusion : This also occurs along a concentration gradient, but involves carrier proteins to help move the drug across the membrane. No ATP is used because the process is still passive (driven by the concentration gradient).
4: Antiport (Na/K ATPase): Antiport transport system actively moves ions (Na+, K+) against their concentration gradient using ATP in the opposite direction. It is a form of primary active transport.
5: symport : Two substances are transported in the same direction across a membrane. ATP is required to move substances against their gradients, often via a secondary active transport mechanism.",650-558.PNG,A,
Question 23,choose the correct options from the given statements ofthe enteric nervous system-,"a) 1,2,3
b) 1,4
c) 1,3
d) 2","The enteric nervous system functions independently of the brain and spinal Cord. (statement 2)
statement 2: Functions independent of brain and spinal cord: The enteric nervous system is often referred to as the ""second brain"" because it can function independently of the central nervous system (CNs). It has its own reflex circuits and can control gut motility, secretion, and blood flow without input from the brain or spinal cord, although it can be influenced by them.
statement 1: The vagus is the only afferent from the gut: while the vagus nerve does provide significant afferent (sensory) input from the gut, other nerves, such as those from the pelvic splanchnic nerves, also contribute to afferent pathways. Therefore, the vagus is not the only afferent nerve.
statement 3: ■Myenteric plexus in the lamina propria: The myenteric plexus is located between the circular and longitudinal muscle layers of the gut, not in the lamina propria (which is part of the mucosal layer of the gut).
statement 4: Exclusively under the influence of nerves: The enteric nervous system is influenced by nerves, but it also responds to hormonal and immune system signals. Therefore, it is not exclusively under neural influence.
statement 5: only parasympathetic connects enteric to CNs: Both parasympathetic and sympathetic connect the enteric nervous system to the central nervous system. Not just the parasympathetic.
The enteric nervous system consists of submucosal and myenteric plexi. This Plexi can function independently and is often referred to as the ‘little brain’. The enteric nervous system regulates gastrointestinal (GI) function and is connected to the central nervous system by parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers.
The myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus is present between the longitudinal and circular muscle layers. It innervates both these layers along the entire length of the GI tract. It primarily controls GI motility. on stimulation, it has the following effects:
• Increased tone of the GI wall
• Increased intensity and rate of rhythmic contractions
• Increased velocity of excitatory wave conduction
some of the myenteric plexus neurons primarily release vasoactive inhibitory peptide (VIP), which causes the relaxation of the GI sphincters.
The submucosal (Meissner’s) plexus is found between the mucosa and the circular muscle layers. It innervates the GI glands, endocrine cells, and submucosal blood vessels. It primarily controls GI secretions, absorption, and local blood flow.
The parasympathetic innervation of the plexi is from the vagus and pelvic nerves. They release either acetylcholine or substance P. It generally increases GI motility and secretion.
The sympathetic innervation is from the celiac, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric, and hypogastric sympathetic ganglia. It generally inhibits GI motility and stimulates sphincteric contraction.",,D,
Question 24,what causes decrease in GFR?,"a) Decrease in glomerular coefficient
b) Decrease in glomerular oncotic pressure
c) Increase in glomerular hydrostatic pressure
d) Decrease of Bowman's hydrostatic pressure","Decrease in glomerular coefficient causes decrease in GFR.
The glomerular filtration coefficient (kf) is a measure of how efficiently the glomerulus filters blood into the kidney tubules. It depends on two key factors:
• surface Area for Filtration: Greater surface area means higher filtration.
• Permeability of the Glomerular Membrane: Higher permeability leads to greater filtration.
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the volume of fluid filtered from the renal glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule per unit time.
The GFR is determined by the sum of the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces across the glomerular membrane, which gives the net filtration pressure. It is dependent on Glomerular kf (glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient) also.
Mathematically, it can be expressed as follows:
GFR= kf [PG + πB -PB- πG]
Forces favoring Filtration
• PG: Glomerular hydrostatic pressure (option C)
• πB: Bowman’s capsule oncotic pressure
Forces opposing Filtration
• PB: Bowman’s capsule hydrostatic pressure (option D)
• πG: Glomerular capillary oncotic pressure (option B)
The formula for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) incorporates kf:
• A high kf means efficient filtration (e.g., in healthy kidneys)-indicates high GFR
• A low kf {occurs when the surface area is reduced (e.g., due to glomerular damage) or the membrane becomes less permeable (e.g., in diabetic nephropathy)}- indicates low GFR.
kf is essential for maintaining proper kidney function, as it directly affects how well the kidneys filter blood to form urine.",,A,
Question 25,A 7o-year-old man with a BP of 17o/1oommHg. what is the reason for the increased pulse pressure in this patient?,"a) Decreased arterial compliance
b) Increased cardiac output
c) Increased sympathetic outflow
d) Increased myocardial contractility","pulse pressure increases with age due to decreased arterial wall compliance.
Diastolic blood pressure falls after 6o years of age due to increased arterial stiffness and decreased compliance, often associated with arteriosclerosis. As the left ventricle contracts against stiffer, less compliant arteries, systolic blood pressure also increases.
As a result of these two changes, pulse pressure increases (↑pp = ↑sBp - ↓DBp)
The factors that affect the pulse pressure:
• the stroke volume output of the heart
• the compliance or total distensibility of the arterial walls
• the character of ejection from the heart during systole (less important)
pulse pressure = stroke volume/ arterial compliance
widened pulse pressure (> 4o mm Hg) occurs with several diseases such as:
• Aortic regurgitation
• Aortic sclerosis
• severe iron deficiency anaemia
• Arteriosclerosis
• Hyperthyroidism
In the majority of these cases, systolic pressures increase while diastolic pressures remain near normal.",,A,
Question 26,Physiological dead space :,"a) can be measured by spirometry
b) Is lesser than anatomical dead space
c) Represents inadequately ventilated alveoli
d) Represents inadequately perfused alveoli","physiological dead space represents inadequately perfused alveoli.
physiological dead space is the part of the respiratory system where no gas exchange occurs. It includes:
• Anatomic dead space: Air in the conducting airways (nose, trachea, bronchi) that doesn't reach the alveoli.
• Alveolar dead space: Air in alveoli that are ventilated but not perfused by blood.
Together, it represents the total volume of air that doesn't participate in oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange.(option B)
Anatomical dead space refers to the volume of all the space of the respiratory system other than the alveoli that do not participate in gas exchange. The anatomical dead space is not altered with a change in ventilation.
In healthy individuals:
• Anatomical dead space 〓 15o mL.
• Alveolar dead space is usually zero (increased in diseased conditions).
Alveolar Dead space represents inadequately perfused alveoli (wasted ventilation). (option c)
In normal individuals, physiological dead space remains unaltered and is equal to the anatomical dead space (volume of all the space of the respiratory system other than the alveoli that do not participate in gas exchange).
Dead space cannot be measured using spirometry. (option A)",,D,
Question 27,what contributes to the latent period of muscle twitch?,"a) 1,2,4
b) 1,2,3
c) 3,4
d) 2,3","Neuromuscular transmission, Excitation contraction coupling and transmission impulse from nerve coupling contribute to latent period of muscle twitch.
The latent period of a muscle twitch is the brief delay between the application of a stimulus (such as a nerve impulse) and the onset of muscle contraction. During this period, several physiological processes occur, but neuromuscular transmission and excitation-contraction coupling primarily contribute to this delay.
Neuromuscular transmission: The action potential travels down the motor neuron to the neuromuscular junction. Acetylcholine (Ach) is released into the synaptic cleft and binds to receptors on the muscle fiber's sarcolemma, triggering an action potential in the muscle fiber. (statement 1)
Excitation-contraction coupling: The action potential propagates along the sarcolemma and into the transverse (T) tubules. This triggers the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. calcium binds to troponin, initiating the interaction of actin and myosin filaments. (statement 2)
Reuptake of calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum: This occurs during the relaxation phase, not the latent period. (statement 3)
Transmission of impulse from nerve: This is a part of neuromuscular transmission and is involved in the latent period. (statement 4)",,A,
Question 28,"Mechanical nociceptors and their response to a probe with a blunt object, pinprick, and toothed forceps with serrations are recorded as an output of a force transducer coupled to the stimulator. what could be inferred from this?","a) There are no responses from the nociceptors when stimulated by blunt forceps
b) pinching with toothed forceps causes stimulation of mechano-nociceptors, but no pain
c) pricking with a needle does not stimulate nociceptors
d) sharp pain sensation is carried by C fibres","There are no responses from the nociceptors when stimulated by blunt forceps.
Mechanical nociceptors typically respond to noxious mechanical stimuli, such as sharp pressure or intense stretch. A blunt object, such as blunt forceps, may not provide a strong enough stimulus to activate these nociceptors, leading to no response.
The sharp painful sensation felt immediately upon injury is known as fast pain. The poorly localized dull aching pain is characteristic of slow pain. The nerve fibers carrying fast pain and slow pain are Aδ and C respectively.
Nociceptors are innervated by both Aδ and C fibers. Aδ fibers are myelinated and larger in diameter with a faster conduction velocity. C fibers are unmyelinated and conduct impulses at a slower rate. when nociceptors are activated by a noxious stimulus, activated Aδ fibers release glutamate and mediate fast pain. It is a rapid response that is responsible for localizing the noxious stimulus.
other options:
option B: pinching with toothed forceps causes stimulation of mechanonociceptors, but no pain: pinching with toothed forceps typically applies more localized pressure, which can activate mechanical nociceptors. However, it may still cause a painful sensation, not just a mechanical response. It is more likely that pain is perceived, even if the response is primarily mechanical.
option C: pricking with a needle does not stimulate nociceptors: A needle prick is a sharp stimulus that activates nociceptors, particularly mechanical nociceptors in response to tissue damage.
option D: sharp pain sensation is carried by C fibers: sharp pain (due to a needle prick) is typically carried by A-delta fibers, which transmit fast, localized pain sensations. C fibers are responsible for carrying dull, burning pain that occurs later after the initial sharp pain.",652-560.PNG,A,
Question 29,peripheral chemoreceptors are most sensitive to?,"a) Hypercapnia
b) Hypoxia
c) Acidosis
d) Alkalosis","peripheral chemoreceptors are most sensitive to hypoxia.
peripheral Chemoreceptors are located in the carotid bodies (at the bifurcation of the common carotid arteries) and aortic bodies (near the aortic arch). They are sensitive to changes in po2, pCo2, and pH of the blood. In response to changes in these parameters, they send impulses to the medullary respiratory centers and modify the duration and frequency of respiratory cycles.
peripheral chemoreceptors are most sensitive to a drop in partial pressure of oxygen (pao■) in arterial blood.
Mechanism:
Type I glomus cells in the carotid and aortic bodies have o2-sensitive K+ channels, which are inactivated in response to hypoxia. This reduces the K+ efflux, depolarizing the cell and causing Ca2+ in■ux, via L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. The Ca2+ influx triggers action potentials and consequent excitation of the afferent nerve endings in the peripheral chemoreceptors.
Hypoxia (pao■ < 6o mmHg) strongly stimulates these receptors, leading to an increase in respiratory rate and depth to improve oxygenation.
other options:
peripheral chemoreceptors also respond to hypercapnia (option A) and acidosis (option C). However, these are primarily detected by central chemoreceptors, located in the medulla, which monitor Co■ levels in cerebrospinal fluid.
Alkalosis (option D) causes a weaker response from peripheral chemoreceptors compared to hypoxia.",,B,
Question 30,Identify the marked structure.,"a) Intercalated disc
b) connective tissue
c) cytoskeletal condensation
d) Nerve fibre","The given section shows cardiac muscle and the marked structure is an intercalated disc.
Intercalated discs are specialized structures unique to cardiac muscle tissue. They are critical for the coordinated contraction of cardiac muscle cells. They are found at the junctions between adjacent cardiac muscle cells. They appear as dark, zigzagging lines under a microscope. They facilitate the rhythmic and coordinated contraction of the heart by ensuring efficient electrical and mechanical connections.
on microscopy, cardiac muscle can be identified by:
• presence of striations similar to the skeletal muscle.
• presence of single and centrally placed nucleus. A perinuclear halo may be seen surrounding the nucleus.
• The junctions between adjoining cardiac myocytes are seen as dark staining transverse lines running across the muscle fibre. These lines are called intercalated discs.
• cells within one fibre branch and join the cells in adjacent fibres.
other options:
option B: connective Tissue: Found surrounding the cardiac muscle cells, providing structural support, but not at the cell junctions.
option c: cytoskeletal condensation: Refers to cytoskeletal organization within a cell and is not visible as distinct structures in cardiac muscle histology.
option D: Nerve Fibre: present in cardiac tissue to innervate the heart but appears as separate structures and not within cardiac muscle fibers.",653-561.PNG,A,676-578.PNG
Question 31,which blood component is not separated by centrifugation in the blood bank?,"a) Red blood cells
b) platelets
c) cryoprecipitate
d) Albumin","Albumin is not separated by centrifugation in the blood bank.
In blood banks, centrifugation is used to separate the main components of blood into distinct layers for storage and transfusion purposes. These components include:
• Red Blood Cells (RBCs): separated by centrifugation and stored for patients with anemia or significant blood loss. (option A)
• platelets: Isolated through centrifugation of plasma-rich blood for use in patients with bleeding disorders. (option B)
• Cryoprecipitate: Derived from plasma by controlled freezing and thawing, which allows the collection of clotting factors (e.g., Factor VIII, fibrinogen, von willebrand factor). (option C)
Albumin is a plasma protein that is extracted through a process called fractionation, not simple centrifugation. This involves the use of chemical, temperature, and pH adjustments to isolate albumin from plasma.",nan,D,677-579.PNG
