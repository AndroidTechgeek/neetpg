Q1,"A patient presents to the casualty following blunt trauma to the chest. A chest X-ray was
done. Among the following radiographs, in which case would you further evaluate the patient before putting a chest tube?","a)4
b)1
c)2
d)3","Among the following radiographs, image 1 shows dilated bowel loops in the hemithorax, and is suggestive of diaphragmatic hernia and it needs to be evaluated further before putting a chest   tube since it can cause injury to the intestinal contents in the thorax.
Blunt injury to the diaphragm can lead to rupture and therefore the abdominal contents can
herniate into the chest. Nasogastric tube placement followed by chest radiography can be useful in case of herniation of the stomach into the chest. The most accurate investigation is video-assisted  thoracoscopy or laparoscopy.
operative repair should be done. Repair should be done via the abdomen in case of a
diaphragmatic rupture.
Radiographs 2,3,4 are hemothorax, pneumothorax, and flail chest respectively. These conditions    are life-threatening. Hence, the diagnosis and management have to be immediate. Rapid insertion of intercostal chest drains should be done. They are inserted into the fifth intercostal space. The     safe landmark is identified as a triangle that lies anterior to the midaxillary line above the nipple,  below, and lateral to the pectoralis major muscle.
The below images show the triangle of safety and technique of chest drain insertion.






Hemothorax can occur following blunt trauma. It occurs due to bleeding from the intercostal
vessels or internal mammary artery secondary to rib fracture. Features include hemorrhagic
shock, flat neck veins, unilateral absence of breath sounds, and dullness on percussion. correction of hypovolemic shock, intercostal drain insertion, and intubation are useful in management.
pneumothorax can be open or tension pneumothorax. In tension pneumothorax, the common
etiology is penetrating or blunt trauma, and features such as tachypnea, dyspnea, distended neck veins, tracheal deviation, hyper resonance and decreased breath sounds are seen. Immediate
decompression can be attained by large bore cannula insertion into the second intercostal space on the affected side in the midclavicular line after which a chest tube can be placed in the 5th
intercostal space along the anterior axillary line. chest radiograph shows mediastinal shift to the opposite side and diaphragmatic depression on the same side.
Flail chest occurs as a result of blunt trauma and is associated with rib fractures. clinically,
paradoxical movement of the chest can be present. Management includes oxygen administration, analgesia, chest drain, and surgery to stabilize the flail segment. Rib fractures can be seen on

Q2,"A 3o-year-old patient presents with progressive difficulty in swallowing both solids and
liquids for 8 months. A barium swallow was done and is shown in the image below. what other investigations should be done to confirm the diagnosis in this patient?","a)UGIE + manometry
b)UGIE + contrast enhanced CT
c)UGIE + PET
d)UGIE + 24 hr pH monitoring","The given clinical scenario and the barium swallow showing bird beak sign are suggestive of    achalasia cardia. upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (uGIE) and manometry should be done to confirm the diagnosis.
Achalasia is a motility disorder and is less common. It typically presents as dysphagia for solids and liquids. other features such as regurgitation and chest pain are also present.
on fluoroscopy, a grossly dilated esophagus with tapering end towards the gastroesophageal junction is seen. This is called the bird beak sign.
Barium is retained in the esophagus for more than 5 minutes and is a significant finding.
Diagnosis is confirmed with endoscopy and manometry.",3976-2533.PNG,A,
Q3,"A 28-year-old woman with a severe headache is scheduled to undergo a CT scan. During
history taking, which of the following will you definitely ask for before the commencement of the scan?","a)Use of cochlear implant
b)LMP
c)History of fall
d)History of hypertension","The most important information that should be ascertained during history taking in a 28-year-old woman of reproductive age group posted for a CT scan is the last menstrual period (LMP). CT
scan is avoided during pregnancy due to the potential adverse effects of radiation on the fetus; hence, LMP is ascertained to rule out pregnancy.
CT is a high-resolution technique using x-rays to generate cross-sectional images of any area of the body. It is associated with high radiation doses.
other options:
option A: use of cochlear implant is a contraindication for MRI and not CT. CT scan can be performed on a patient with a cochlear implant.
option B: History of fall in a patient with a headache is asked for suspected head trauma. A CT scan in this patient can help in the diagnosis and assess extent of damage.
option C: History of hypertension points to a possible intracranial bleed. A CT scan can be useful in ruling out the bleed.
since it is imperative to rule out pregnancy before taking a CT scan, last menstrual period is the most appropriate answer to this question.",,B,
Q4,which of the following findings are seen in a high-resolution CT scan of fungal pneumonia?,"a)1, 2, 4
b)1, 3, 4
c)1, 2, 3
d)2, 3, 4","High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of fungal pneumonia shows interlobular  septations, peripheral wedge-shaped consolidation, and pleural effusion. HRCT of fungal pneumonia shows a nodule (not a cavity) with surrounding ground-glass opacities.



A nodule surrounded by ground-glass attenuation on HRCT imaging is seen in aspergillosis,
candidiasis, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, coccidioidomycosis, and
paracoccidioidomycosis. Cavitation on HRCT is seen in cases of community-acquired pneumonia due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, S. aureus, and gram-negative bacilli.
Aspergillosis is a fungal disease caused by Aspergillus sp. pulmonary aspergillosis has been categorized into saprophytic, allergic, and invasive forms.
HRCT findings of various types of aspergillosis are as follows:
• Aspergilloma (saprophytic) shows a mass with soft-tissue attenuation, which is separated from the thoracic wall by airspace called the air crescent sign. Multiple nodules and bilateral
involvement may be seen.
• Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABpA-allergic) shows hypodense mucous plugs.
• Angioinvasive aspergillosis shows multiple nodules surrounded by a halo of ground-glass attenuation (‘halo sign’) or pleural-based wedge-shaped areas of consolidation.
The following is an HRCT image of aspergilloma showing the air crescent sign:


The following CT image of aspergilloma shows the halo sign:





Candidiasis pneumonia caused by Candida sp. in immunocompromised patients shows multiple bilateral nodular opacities, areas of consolidation, and ground-glass opacities on HRCT.  pleural effusion, thickening of the bronchial walls, and cavitation are less commonly seen.
paracoccidioidomycosis (pCM), is a disease caused by paracoccidioides brasiliensis. on HRCT,
ground-glass opacities, nodules, the ‘halo’ and ‘reversed halo’ signs, interlobular septal thickening, airspace consolidation, cavitation, and fibrosis.",,C,3985-2542.PNG;3986-2543.PNG
Q5,"An elderly lady presents with abdominal pain and distension. she has a history of scoliosis. Given below is the erect X-ray abdomen radiograph of the lady. what is the most likely
diagnosis?","a)Large bowel obstruction due to sigmoid volvulus
b)Large bowel obstruction due to fecolith
c)cecal volvulus
d)small bowel obstruction due to bowel perforation","The given clinical scenario with an old woman and the radiograph showing characteristic coffee bean appearance are highly suggestive of sigmoid volvulus causing a large bowel obstruction.
sigmoid volvulus is a cause of large bowel obstruction and occurs when the sigmoid
colon twists on the sigmoid mesocolon. symptoms include constipation, abdominal bloating,
nausea, and/or vomiting. The onset may be acute or chronic. It occurs more commonly in patients with a history of mental illness and chronic constipation.
X-ray abdomen shows a large, dilated loop of the colon, often with a few air-fluid levels. specific    signs include the coffee bean sign, Frimann-Dahl sign (three dense lines converge towards the site of obstruction), and the absence of rectal gas. CT may reveal a large gas-filled
loop without haustral markings, forming a closed-loop obstruction.
Here are some pointers that help in differentiating the two volulus:
other options:
option B: In large bowel obstruction due to fecolith, the presence of haustrations is a feature.
Haustral folds are irregular and do not cross the entire diameter of the bowel. These are absent in the cecum. The given image shows haustrations in large bowel obstruction.
The following image shows an x-ray radiograph of large bowel obstruction:



sigmoid volvulus	cecal volvulus
More common incidence	Less common incidence
coffee bean sign is typical.	coffee bean sign is occassion ally seen
seen in old age, psychiatric p atients	usually seen in those aged 3 o-6o years old
The top of the sigmoid volvul us usually lies very high in th e abdomen with its apex on t  he left side.	In half the patients, the caec   um twists and inverts so that  the pole of the caecum and th e appendix occupy the left up per quadrant.In other patient s, the twist occurs in an axial  plane without inversion and t he caecum still occupies the r ight half of the abdomen.
Haustra aren't usually seen	Haustra usually seen
Multiple air-fluid level seen	one air-fluid level seen
	Attached air-filled appendix c an be seen


option c: cecal volvulus shows characteristic radiological findings like cecal dilatation, single air-fluid level that may extend into the left upper quadrant, and absence of gas in the distal
colon. The colonic haustrations are well maintained.
The following image shows an x-ray radiograph of cecal volvulus:





option D: In small bowel obstructions, the obstructed bowel loops are central in location and lie transversely. The jejunal obstruction shows valvulae conniventes (mucosal folds that cross the     entire diameter of the bowel) giving it a ladder effect. The distended cecum may show the
presence of gas shadow in the right iliac fossa.
common causes of small bowel obstruction are adhesions (~6o%), neoplasms (~2o%), hernias (~1o%), crohn's disease (~5%) and other miscellaneous conditions (~5%).
The following image shows an x-ray radiograph of small bowel obstruction:


cases of bowel perforation have an erect abdominal radiograph showing free gas

Q6,A child presents with cyanosis. His chest radiograph is shown below. what is the diagnosis?,"a)Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)
b)Ebstein's anomaly
c)Transposition of great arteries (TGA)
d)Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVC)","The given clinical scenario and chest X-ray showing a ""coeur en sabot"" or boot-shaped heart are suggestive of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).
TOF is a cyanotic congenital heart disease with the following four components:
• Obstruction to right ventricular outflow (pulmonary stenosis)
• Malalignment type of ventricular septal defect (VSD)
• Dextroposition of the aorta so that it overrides the ventricular septum (overriding of the aorta), and
• Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)
In TOF, the hypertrophied right ventricle causes the rounded apical shadow to be uptilted so that it is situated higher above the diaphragm than normal. On x-ray, this appears as a boot-shaped
heart or coeur en sabot, as shown below:





option B: Ebstein anomaly is a rare cyanotic congenital heart disease with diminished pulmonary blood flow due to abnormality of the tricuspid valve.
In the Ebstein anomaly, there is severe right-sided cardiomegaly due to an elongated and enlarged right atrium, which leads to an elevated apex giving a box-shaped heart, as shown below:


option C: Transposition of great arteries (TGA) can present from birth to infancy with cyanosis, decreased exercise tolerance, and poor physical development TGA is the most specific heart
disease in infants of diabetic mothers.
The following is a radiograph of TGA showing the egg-on-a-string appearance/egg-on-side appearance of the heart:





option D: Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVC) occurs due to the anomalous
connection of pulmonary veins instead of joining to the left atrium resulting in pulmonary venous blood reaching the right atrium.
In the supracardiac type of TAPVC, the configuration of the heart and the superior mediastinal borders resemble a snowman. It is also referred to as the figure of 8 sign, as shown below:",3978-2536.PNG,A,3990-2549.PNG;3990-2548.PNG;3991-2551.PNG;3991-2550.PNG

Q8,Identify the condition based on the non-contrast CT scan of a patient given below.,"a)Hepatocellular carcinoma
b)Fibronodular hyperplasia
c)Liver abscess
d)Hydatid cyst","The given CT image shows a cyst in the liver with the serpent sign and areas of calcification, which are suggestive of hydatid disease.
Hydatid disease or echinococcosis is a zoonotic infection caused by the Echinococcus species of flatworms. Its life cycle consists of dogs as definitive hosts and humans as accidental
intermediate hosts.
primary hydatid cysts most commonly occur in the liver. Most patients are asymptomatic but when symptomatic, the patient presents with hepatomegaly, pain, and obstructive jaundice.   The first/initial imaging test is USG, and CT scan can be used to diagnose the condition.
CT scan shows the presence of a space-occupying lesion with a smooth outline and septa. CT scan has an accuracy of 98% in the detection of hydatid cysts and high sensitivity to the detection of     daughter cysts and extra-hepatic cysts.
on CT imaging, serpent sign is seen as wavy membranes within the cyst:


The USG of an active hydatid cyst shows multiple septations and a rosette or honeycomb appearance:





The ball of wool sign is seen on USG when the contents settle in the dependent portion of the cyst, as seen below:


on USG, the water-lily sign is seen in hydatid infections when there is detachment of the endocyst membrane, which results in floating membranes within the pericyst that mimic the appearance of a water lily.





The image below shows the structures present within a cyst.


other options:
option A: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is diagnosed with contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) or
MRI. on a non-contrast CT, it appears as a low-attenuated lesion with occasional calcification. on CECT, HCC lesions show enhancement in the arterial phase and washout in the portal phase.
The following image shows the triphasic CECT of HCC:





option B: Focal nodular hyperplasia is a benign solid lesion in the liver. Histologically, it is    composed of normal liver elements, but the biliary elements are not connected to the normal biliary tree. on CECT, they exhibit homogeneous enhancement in the arterial phase of IV
contrast.
The image below shows late arterial and portal venous phase CECT of focal nodular hyperplasia:


option C: Liver abscess may be caused by various infections. It begins as a local inflammatory reaction and later develops liquefactive necrosis in the center, with an inflammatory margin.

Q10,"whole-body CT scan protocol for a trauma patient includes all, except ______.","a)CT Head
b)CT Cervical spine
c)CT Limbs
d)CT Abdomen","The whole-body CT of a trauma patient does not include CT limbs.
whole-body CT or trauma CT or panscan is increasingly being used in the context of trauma patients with a dangerous mechanism of injury:
• Non-contrast CT of head
• Non-contrast CT of neck
• Contrast-enhanced CT of chest (arterial phase)



• Contrast-enhanced CT of abdomen (portal venous phase)

Q11,"A patient presents with hematuria and a mass in the right kidney on a CT scan, as shown below. what is the diagnosis?","a)Renal cell carcinoma
b)Renal oncocytoma
c)Renal angiomyolipoma
d)Renal cyst","The CT image showing renal lesions that has hypo-attenuating components consistent with macroscopic fat is highly suggestive of renal angiomyolipoma.
Angiomyolipomas are benign tumors that occur sporadically or in association with tuberous
sclerosis. The mean age of presentation is 43 years and there is a female predilection. It can
present as spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage, especially with larger tumors. The patient    can present with flank pain, palpable mass, hematuria, urinary tract infections, hypertension, or renal failure.
Imaging in renal angiomyolipoma: Demonstration of macroscopic fat is the main part of making a diagnosis. USG may show hyperechoic lesions in the cortex with posterior acoustic shadowing. In  patients with tuberous sclerosis, the entire kidney is affected and produces an echogenic
appearance with loss of normal corticomedullary junction.
CT findings:
• Cortical lesions that demonstrate macroscopic fat (less than -2o HU)
• Absence of ossification or calcification
• The presence of macroscopic fat is strongly suggestive of this condition, but not pathognomonic as RCC may rarely demonstrate macroscopic fat.
• Approximately 5% may be fat-poor.
MRI: It is an excellent tool to demonstrate intramural fat components. Two sequences are used:
• Fat-saturated techniques
• phase-in and phase-out imaging that shows India ink artifacts at the junction between fat and non-fat components.
Digital subtraction angiography: They are hypervascular lesions showing a 'sunburst appearance' in the arterial phase and an 'onion peel appearance' in the venous phase.
They usually do not require any intervention. mTOR inhibitors like everolimus can be used to decrease the size of the lesion.





other options:
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC): It is the most common malignant tumor of the kidney. It usually
occurs in the age group 5o-7o years and macroscopic hematuria is seen in about 6o% of the cases. It is a differential for angiomyolipoma but it is important to note that macroscopic fat is almost
always associated with ossification or calcification.


Renal oncocytoma: They are relatively benign in nature and usually present in the 6th to 7th
decade. An important point regarding this tumor is its similarity with RCC and hence it is very
difficult to differentiate between them preoperatively. A sharp central stellate scar may be seen in one-third of the cases. But RCC may also show this stellate scar appearance in some cases.






Renal cyst: It is a broader term that includes the cystic lesions of the kidney. They can be simple cysts that are benign. complex or complicated cystic lesions needs evaluation and can be
malignant. Bosniak classification of renal cysts is given above.

A ring of calcification at the periphery of a lymph node is known as eggshell calcification.",,D,
Q13,"A 55-year-old man presents with hematuria and a mass in the left kidney on a CECT scan, as shown below. what is the diagnosis?","a)Renal angiomyolipoma
b)Renal oncocytoma
c)Renal cell carcinoma
d)Renal cyst","The history of an elderly male presenting with painless hematuria, renal mass, and an axial renal cortical phase CECT image showing renal lesions with irregular enhancement is suggestive of
renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common malignant tumor of the kidney. It usually occurs in the age group 5o–7o years and macroscopic hematuria is seen in about 6o% of the cases. It
usually presents with painless gross hematuria, flank pain, or painless flank mass.
Contrast-enhanced CT is the investigation of choice for RCC. on CT, small lesions enhance
homogeneously, whereas larger lesions have irregular enhancement due to areas of necrosis. The clear cell subtype may show much stronger enhancement is a differential for angiomyolipoma.
still, it is essential to note that macroscopic fat is almost always associated with ossification or calcification.
T1-weighted MRI is often heterogeneous due to necrosis, hemorrhage, and solid
components. T2-weighted MRI is hyperdense for clear cell RCC and hypodense for papillary RCC. Thus, a T2-weighted MRI can be used for histological diagnosis. Contrast-enhanced MRI is the
investigation of choice for detecting vascular invasion of RCC.

Q14,A patient who was diagnosed with prostate cancer is being investigated. The bone scan is reported as a super scan with increased uptake in the bones and reduced activity in the    kidney and soft tissue. what is the reason for this super scan appearance?,"a)Increased uptake due to diffuse metastasis
b)Increased uptake by carcinoma prostate
c)Increased uptake by the bone
d)Decreased uptake by adrenal glands and kidney","The super scan appearance is due to increased uptake due to diffuse metastasis.
Diffuse osteoblastic metastatic diseases such as carcinoma breast and prostate carcinoma lead to a generalized increase in the skeletal uptake relative to soft tissue and absent or faint renal activity   on a bone scan. This is known as a super scan. It may also be seen in generalized bone diseases
such as hyperparathyroidism.
carcinoma of the prostate is the most common malignant tumor in men over the age of 65 years. Most cancers are clinically silent and are detected on routine rectal examination or PSA
measurements. Grossly, malignant tissue is gritty and firm in consistency (in contrast to the spongy appearance of benign tissue) and thus more readily palpable on digital rectal
examination. They usually arise in the peripheral zone of the gland.
Local extension most commonly involves the periprostatic tissue, seminal vesicles, and the base of the urinary bladder. Metastasis spreads via the lymphatics to the obturator nodes and the
para-aortic nodes. Hematogenous spread occurs chiefly through the bones to the axial
skeleton and rarely to the viscera. The bony metastasis is blastic in origin and involves the lumbar spine, proximal femur, pelvis, thoracic spine, and ribs in decreasing order of frequency.
Prognosis and staging: The Gleason grading system correlates with the pathological stage, spread, and prognosis. Measurement of serum PSA levels may be useful to assist with the diagnosis and    management.",,A,
