Q1,"An elderly patient who is a known case of scleroderma presented with shortness of breath. on examination, her right ventricular pressure was 7o-8o mmHg and later on catheterization,
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was found to be 35 mmHg. which of the following is true regarding her condition?","a)calcium channel blockers given for all the patients
b)Lung transplant is the best treatment, if identified early
c)Endothelin receptor antagonists improves symptoms
d)Lifestyle modification is the only possible approach","In this elderly patient with scleroderma presenting with elevated right ventricular pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, is suggestive of scleroderma/systemic
sclerosis(ssc)-associated pulmonary hypertension, and endothelin receptor antagonists improve the symptoms.
Right heart catheterization, the gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension, confirms the condition when the mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) exceeds 2o mmHg. In this
elderly patient with scleroderma, elevated right ventricular pressure (7o-8o mmHg) and    pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (35 mmHg) indicate severe pulmonary hypertension.
This condition involves intimal thickening and narrowing of pulmonary arteries, leading to
increased blood flow resistance and symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, and hemoptysis. As



the disease progresses, it causes right ventricular dysfunction, presenting as syncope, abdominal distension, ascites, and peripheral edema. The disease leads to vascular changes like intimal
proliferation, fibrosis, and thrombosis, which increase right ventricular afterload and total    pulmonary vascular resistance, ultimately resulting in decreased cardiac output, irreversible damage, and potential right heart failure and death.
An echocardiogram with a bubble study is an important screening test that will reveal a dilated and hypertrophied right ventricle. on chest x-ray, 'vascular pruning' may be seen as well as
enlarged pulmonary arteries.
Management for pulmonary hypertension:


Note: Early identification of pAH(option B) allows for effective management with available
medical therapies, making lung transplant a later option rather than the immediate treatment of choice.
Vasoreactivity testing involves the administration of inhaled nitric oxide, IV epoprostenol, IV
adenosine, or inhaled iloprost. The test is considered positive if the mean pulmonary arterial
pressure (mpAH) decreases by ≥ 1o mmHg leading to mpAH ≤ 4o mmHg, without a decrease in cardiac output (Co).",,C,4595-2871.PNG
Q2,"A 26-year-old patient with bronchial asthma who has two episodes in the daytime and one episode at night time per week is prescribed albuterol to use as and when required. MDI
FEV1 improved from 76% to 83% after taking bronchodilator. what is the further treatment plan?","a)Add oral prednisolone 1o mg daily
b)continue albuterol whenever required
c)Add fluticasone propionate 4o mg BD
d)change to salbutamol MDI twice daily","In the given clinical scenario of a patient with mild persistent asthma taking albuterol and FEV1 improving from 76% to 83% after taking bronchodilator, the patient should be prescribed
fluticasone propionate 4omg BD.
Treatment guidelines for different types of asthma are given below:
LABA - Long-acting Beta 2 Agonists, ICS - Inhaled corticosteroids
Add-on therapy includes long-acting anticholinergics, leukotriene antagonists, mast cell stabilizers, methylxanthines, and antibodies.



Drugs used in the treatment of bronchial asthma Bronchodilators
• Beta-2 sympathomimetics: Salmeterol, Formoterol
• Methylxanthines: Theophylline, Aminophylline
• Anticholinergics: Ipratropium bromide, Tiotropium bromide Anti-inflammatory
• Corticosteroids (Inhalational): Beclomethasone, Budesonide, Fluticasone
• Corticosteroids (Systemic): Prednisolone, Hydrocortisone
• Mast cell stabilizers: Sodium cromoglycate, ketotifen
• Leukotriene antagonists: Montelukast, zafirlukast
• anti-IgE - omalizumab
• anti-IL5 - Mepolizumab, Reslizumab
• anti-IL4 receptor - Dupilumab
Important update - According to GINA 2019, Short-acting beta 2 agonists (SABA) have no role in treating acute exacerbations. Even though SABA provides short-term relief of symptoms, there is  strong evidence that SABA only treatment increases the risk of exacerbations.
GINA now recommends that symptom-driven (in mild asthma), a daily dose of ICS (inhaled
corticosteroids) containing treatment to reduce the risk of serious exacerbations. This is said to be the most important change in asthma management in 30 years

Step 1 (intermittent)	As needed low dose ICS + Fo rmoterol
Step 2 (mild persistent)	Daily low-dose ICS
Step 3 (moderate persistent)	Daily low dose ICS + LABA
Step 4 (severe persistent)	Medium dose ICS + LABA +/- add-on therapy
Step 5	High dose ICS + LABA + oral steroids +/- add-on therapy",,C,
Q3,"A 3o-year-old patient came with chest pain shortness of breath, and pedal edema. JVP
showed rapid y descent. on auscultation, he had high-pitched diastolic sound. what is the diagnosis?","a)chronic constrictive pericarditis
b)cardiac tamponade
c)RHD with Mitral stenosis
d)Bicuspid aortic valve with Aortic regurgitation","The combination of the given clinical history and JVP showing rapid y descent is highly suggestive of chronic constrictive pericarditis.
Constrictive pericarditis is a chronic type of pericarditis that results when there is healing of acute fibrinous pericarditis or absorption of chronic pericardial effusion. The most common cause in
developing countries is tuberculosis, following viral pericarditis, cardiac surgery, mediastinal
irradiation, or as a manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis and SLE. The main abnormality that   occurs in constrictive pericarditis is the inability of the ventricles to fill because of the rigid and



thickened pericardium. The restriction is not uniform through the diastole as seen in tamponade. Ventricular filling is normal early in the diastole but stops suddenly when the elastic limit of the   pericardium is reached.
Y-descent on the JVP curve is prominent in constrictive pericarditis because it represents the rapid early filling of the ventricles. A sudden stop in ventricular filling and subsequent rising  pressure is seen as a square root sign in the JVP curve.
The patient presents with exertional dyspnea and orthopnea. There may be a paradoxical rise in venous pressure during inspiration (kussmaul's sign) reflecting impaired right ventricular
compliance. The ECG often shows low-voltage QRS complexes and diffuse flattening ofT-waves. A chest radiograph may show pericardial calcification, especially in tuberculous pericarditis.


The waveforms seen in a normal JVP are:
• a wave corresponds to atrial contraction and occurs just after the P wave (on ECG) and just before the first heart sound.
• c wave represents the bulging of the tricuspid valve into the right atrium during ventricular systole.
• x descent corresponds to the atrial relaxation during atrial diastole.
• v wave represents atrial filling during ventricular systole and peaks at the second heart sound.
• y descent represents passive emptying of the right atrium into the right ventricle after tricuspid valve opening.
A normal tracing of the jugular venous pulse is given below:





other options:
option B: Cardiac tamponade:  on JVP tracing, cardiac tamponade characteristically shows a prominent x-descent and absent y-descent.
The image of JVP in cardiac tamponade is given below:


option C: Mid-diastolic murmur is seen in mitral stenosis (MS). It occurs most commonly in
rheumatic fever. A loud S1 (first heart sound) with an opening snap following S2 (second heart   sound) is heard. S2 is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, mid-diastolic murmur, which is best heard at the apex with the patient in a lateral recumbent position.
option D: Aortic regurgitation can occur due to bicuspid aortic valve, rheumatic fever,
degeneration of the valve, etc. Auscultation will have a high-pitched, blowing, decrescendo    diastolic murmur, heard best in the third intercostal space along the left sternal border. Mid systolic ejection murmur can also be heard.",,A,4597-2872.PNG;4598-2874.PNG;4598-2873.PNG
Q4,"A 3o-year-old female patient comes to the outpatient department with complaints of neck swelling. she gives a history of weight loss and palpitations. On examination, she has
exophthalmos and a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland. which of the following is not true?","a)severe disease can cause vision loss
b)NO sPEcs criteria is used for this condition
c)1o% of isolated cases is present without hyperthyroidism
d)condition will improve simultaneously with improvement in thyrotoxic state","The given clinical scenario of a female patient presenting with neck swelling weight loss,
palpitations, exophthalmos, and diffusely enlarged thyroid gland is suggestive of Graves' disease with thyroid eye disease. Thyroid eye disease (TED) does not improve simultaneously with
improvement in the thyrotoxic state.
Graves’ disease causes hyperthyroidism through thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI)
synthesized by lymphocytes in the thyroid gland, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. TSI antibodies stimulate the thyroid gland, causing hyperthyroidism.
Symptoms include hyperactivity, heat intolerance, sweating, palpitations, weakness, weight loss, increased appetite, and diarrhoea. Signs include tachycardia, goitre, tremor, muscle weakness,    and atrial fibrillation in the elderly.
Thyroid ophthalmopathy is seen in one-third of patients with Grave’s disease. Thyroid
dermopathy usually occurs in the presence of moderate or severe ophthalmopathy. It primarily  manifests as noninflamed, indurated plaques with a deep pink or purple colour and an ""orange   skin"" appearance, commonly found on the anterior and lateral aspects of the lower leg (pretibial myxedema).
Investigations done on a patient with Graves' disease include:
• Thyroid function tests- TSH levels are decreased with or without elevated T3 and T4 levels.
• Anti-thyroid antibodies—Elevated levels of TSH receptor antibodies are diagnostic of Graves' disease. other antibodies, like anti-Tg and anti-TPo, are elevated in most patients.
• Ultrasound of the neck is performed to evaluate vascularity, echogenicity, nodules, and clinical landmarks for surgical planning.
• A radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) scan (thyroid scan) should be performed and a diffuse uptake confirms the diagnosis of Graves' disease. It is also useful to differentiate TSI-negative Graves
disease from toxic nodular disease based on diffuse or nodular uptake patterns.
• CT or MRI scans of the orbits are useful to evaluate Graves’ ophthalmopathy.
Hyperthyroidism can be treated by antithyroid drugs, radioiodine treatment (I131), or
thyroidectomy.
other options:
option A: Severe disease can cause vision loss mainly due to compression of the optic nerve at the orbit's apex, which can result in peripheral field defects, papilledema, and, in the worst case
scenario, irreversible blindness.
option B: No SPECS scoring system as described below can be used to evaluate ophthalmopathy.
• No signs or symptoms
• only signs (lid retraction, or lag)
• Soft tissue involvement (periorbital oedema)
• Proptosis



• Extraocular muscle involvement
• Corneal involvement
• sight loss
option C: 1o% of isolated cases of thyroid eye disease are present without hyperthyroidism as they may also present as euthyroid or hypothyroid.",,D,
Q5,"A 56-year-old presented with fever chills &amp; cough with sputum. Blood pressure was     measured to be 15o/88mmhg, pulse rate - 11obpm and respiratory rate - 18, spo2 - 88% at room air. An X-ray was done and shown below. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)Tubercular pleural effusion
b)community acquired pneumonia
c)coal worker Pneumoconiosis
d)silicosis","The clinical vignette describes a case of community-acquired pneumonia. The findings of fever, chills, cough with expectoration, and chest X-ray findings of lobar involvement support the
diagnosis.
Clinical features include acute onset fever, cough (with or without sputum production), and
shortness of breath. In some cases, pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxemia, or increased work of breathing may be present on physical examination.
Diagnosis can be made using a chest X-ray. The presence of an infiltrate on a plain chest
radiograph is considered the gold standard for diagnosing pneumonia. Radiographic findings
consistent with the diagnosis of CAp include lobar consolidations, interstitial infiltrates, and/or    cavitations. CT chest is used for better resolution or if chest X-ray was non-diagnostic. Blood and sputum cultures are obtained to guide the antibiotic regimen.
other options:
option A: pleural effusion may present with dyspnea, pleuritic pain, dry cough, and associated
symptoms like fever, weight loss, oedema, and ascites depending on the aetiology. on
examination, there may be tachypnea, dullness on percussion and decreased/absent breath sounds at the base(s).


option C: Coal worker's pneumoconiosis (Cwp) is an occupational disease due to chronic
exposure to coal dust. It is seen in people working in mines. It presents small opacities in the



upper lobe of the lungs. Complicated CwP has nodules ≥1 cm in diameter generally confined to the upper half of the lungs.
option D: silicosis is an occupational disease and is caused by exposure to silica. It is seen in
people who work in mining, stone cutting, sandblasting, and quarrying. It presents as small
rounded opacities in the upper lobe. There may be calcification of hilar lymph nodes which leads to the appearance of eggshell calcification. HRCT will show a characteristic crazy paving pattern. The image is given below",4577-2858.PNG,B,4601-2875-1.png;4601-2875.PNG
Q6,A 45-year-old man presented with fatigue and hemoptysis. His current hemoglobin is 8g/dL   (previous hemoglobin one week ago was 12g/dL). His bronchoalveolar lavage is reddish and   his serum creatinine was 1.7mg/dL. He is diagnosed with ANCA-positive glomerulonephritis. Biopsy of the kidney revealed pauci-immune deposits and the absence of granulomas. which of the following conditions is he likely suffering from?,"a)Churg-strauss syndrome
b)Microscopic polyangiitis
c)sLE
d)Henoch–schonlein purpura","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of microscopic polyangiitis. The absence of
granulomatous inflammation differentiates microscopic polyangiitis from other forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis.
Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis is categorized into 3 distinct forms:
• Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; formerly wegener granulomatosis)
• Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)
• Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, formerly called Churg–strauss syndrome (Css) Necrotizing vasculitis is the cardinal histologic feature in both GPA and MPA. kidney biopsies   typically demonstrate crescentic glomerulonephritis with little or no immune complex
deposition. hence the name “pauci-immune vasculitis.”
Granulomatous inflammation is typically absent in MPA but is common in both GPA and Css.
ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) comprises a group of multi-systemic diseases affecting      small-to-medium-sized vessels in organs like kidneys and lungs. It is characterized by the     presence of ANCA with specificity for either proteinase-3 (PR3) or myeloperoxidase (MPo).
other options:



option A: Churg-strauss syndrome is typically characterized by a necrotizing granulomatous small vessel vasculitis with a history of bronchial asthma and peripheral eosinophilia.
option C: sLE is an autoimmune disease involving multiple organs, with a vast array of
autoantibodies, particularly antinuclear antibodies (ANA). The lesion occurs mainly by deposition of immune complexes and binding of antibodies to various cells and tissues
option D: Henoch–schonlein purpura is the most common vasculitis in childhood. It is
characterized by leukocytoclastic vasculitis and IgA deposition in the skin, kidney, joints, and GIT. The clinical manifestations include palpable purpura, joint involvement in the form of arthritis or  arthralgias, diarrhoea, vomiting, renal involvement in the form of microscopic hematuria,
proteinuria, etc.",,B,
Q7,"A patient with an acute exacerbation of COPD required mechanical ventilation and
experienced a consistent drop in oxygen saturation. Auscultation revealed vesicular breath    sounds on the right side. Based on the chest radiography findings, what would you expect to hear on auscultation of the left side?","a)Absent breath sounds
b)Bronchial breath sounds
c)Increased vesicular breath sounds
d)Increased vocal fremitus","Absent breath sounds on the left side are expected in this case of left pneumothorax.
A pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space, causing lung collapse and preventing     normal lung expansion, which leads to absent or diminished breath sounds over the affected area. In patients with CoPD, particularly during an acute exacerbation, the already weakened and
hyperinflated lung tissue can rupture, leading to a pneumothorax. This is a serious complication, especially when mechanical ventilation is required, as the pressure from the ventilator can
exacerbate the pneumothorax.
other options:
option B: Bronchial breath sounds: Typically heard in conditions like pneumonia, where there is lung consolidation, not in a pneumothorax.
option C: Increased vesicular breath sounds: These indicate hyperinflation or normal lung function, which is not possible in a collapsed lung.
option D: Increased vocal fremitus: Fremitus is usually decreased or absent in pneumothorax due to the insulating effect of air in the pleural space.",4578-2859.PNG,A,
Q8,"A patient with salicylic acid poisoning has the following arterial blood gas analysis report: pH = 7.3, pCo2 =16mmHg, HCo3-=6.3mmol/L, Na+- 135, K+- 4.5 Cl- 113.7, lactate was normal.   which of the following options correctly describes the condition?","a)Metabolic acidosis with partial compensated respiratory alkolosis with high anion gap
b)Respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis
c)Metabolic acidosis with uncompensated respiratory alkalosis
d)Respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis","The acid-base disorder here is a mixed disorder of metabolic acidosis with partially compensated respiratory alkalosis with high anion gap.
It should not be confused with metabolic acidosis with uncompensated respiratory alkalosis. This can be understood by the following calculation:
step 1: The pH in this patient is 7.3 (pH &lt;7.35) which indicates acidosis
step 2: HCo3- is 6.3 mmol/L (Normal HCo3- - 22–3o mmol/L). In metabolic acidosis,
HCo3- levels decrease.
Hence, this is a case of metabolic acidosis.
step 3: Calculate the anion gap.



Anion gap = Na+-(cl-+Hco3-) = 135 – (113.7 +6.3)
= 15, which is a high anion gap (normal anion gap is between 6-12 mEq/L)
step 4: As per winter's formula, the expected respiratory compensation in metabolic acidosis can be calculated using,
pco2 =( 1.5 x [Hco3-] ) +8 ± 2
In this case, Expected pco2 = ( 1.5 x [6.3] ) +8 ± 2
= 17.5 ± 2
= 15.45 - 19.45 mmHg
The pco2 in this patient is 16 mmHg, which implies there is an overcompensation of pco2. This overcompensation can happen only if there is an additional component of respiratory alkalosis
contributing to reduced pco2.
Hence, this patient has a mixed disorder - metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis.",,A,
Q9,"Match the following ECG waves with condition: atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, SVT, ventricular tachycardia","a)1-■ , 2-■ , 3-■ , 4-■
b)1-■ , 2-■ , 3-■ , 4-■
c)1-■ , 2-■ , 3-■ , 4-■
d)1-■ , 2-■ , 3-■ , 4-■","The matched option is option A, i.e., 1-■ , 2-■ , 3-■ , 4-■ .
Atrial flutter rhythm is regular. The rate is 25o-3oo bpm. Normal P waves are replaced by saw tooth-shaped waves known as flutter waves.


Atrial fibrillation rhythm is irregularly irregular. P waves are absent, these irregular waves are known as fibrillation waves, characteristic of atrial fibrillation.





Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia (PSvT) ECG shows narrow QRS complex (&lt;o.12 s) tachycardia with an absent P wave.


ventricular tachycardia ECG changes include wide QRS complexes, absence of P waves, and
ventriculoatrial dissociation. It can be broadly classified as sustained vT or non-sustained vT.    Nonsustained vT has QRS complexes lasting &lt;3o seconds while sustained vT lasts for &gt;3o seconds. In monomorphic vT, all QRS complexes look the same. Polymorphic vT has QRS
complexes varying in shape or direction in the same lead.",4579-2860.PNG,A,4603-2876.PNG;4604-2877.PNG;4604-2878.PNG;4605-2879.PNG
Q10,"A 34-year-old patient presents with lethargy and tiredness. on examination, he has perioral hyperpigmentation. His blood pressure is 9o/6o mmHg and his heart rate is 11o
beats/minute. Laboratory investigations revealed Na+ of 125mEq/L and K+ of 5.5mEq/L. what is the most appropriate treatment given to this patient?","a)ACTH
b)Hydrocortisone + Fludrocortisone
c)Dexamethasone
d)saline infusion","This clinical scenario is suggestive of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addisonian crisis) and IV hydrocortisone+fludrocortisone is the most appropriate treatment for this condition.
Adrenal insufficiency can be primary (due to adrenal pathology), secondary (due to pituitary
pathology- lack of ACTH), or tertiary (due to hypothalamus pathology- lack of CRH). Autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency worldwide. Tuberculosis is  the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in India.
Acute adrenal insufficiency (adrenal or addisonian's crisis) is a medical emergency caused due to a precipitating illness unmasking insufficiency or trauma or severe sepsis causing adrenal
hemorrhage (waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome) or surgical removal of the glands. It presents with non-specific symptoms such as shock with fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
hypocalcemia, and electrolyte imbalances. It may be often misdiagnosed as an acute abdominal emergency.
Acute adrenal insufficiency requires the following therapeutic strategies:
• Rehydration - saline infusion at an initial rate of 1 L/h with continuous cardiac monitoring.
• Glucocorticoid replacement - bolus injection of 1oo mg hydrocortisone, followed by the maintenance dose of 1oo–2oo mg over 24h.
• Mineralocorticoid replacement - initiated once the daily hydrocortisone dose has been reduced to &lt;5o mg as higher doses of hydrocortisone have sufficient mineralocorticoid action.",,B,
Q11,"A young woman comes with weight loss, tachycardia, heat intolerance, and tremors. she has exophthalmus on examination. what is the diagnosis?","a)Addison's disease
b)parkinson's disease
c)Graves disease
d)Alzheimer's disease","Based on the clinical findings the most likely diagnosis is Graves' disease.



The hyperthyroidism of Graves’ disease is caused by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins
(TSI) that are synthesized in the thyroid gland as well as in bone marrow and lymph nodes. TSI    cause stimulation of the thyroid gland causing features of hyperthyroidism in the presence of low TSH levels.
clinical features of Graves' disease include hyperthyroid features like hyperactivity, irritability, dysphoria, heat intolerance and sweating palpitations, fatigue, and weakness, weight loss with  increased appetite, diarrhea, polyuria, oligomenorrhea, loss of libido, tachycardia.
Graves ophthalmopathy is due to increased volume of the retroorbital connective tissues and extraocular muscles because of marked lymphocytic infiltration of the retro-orbital
space, accumulation of hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronic acid and chondroitin     sulfate, and increased numbers of adipocytes (fatty infiltration). corneal exposure, lid retraction,   lid lag on downgaze, conjunctival injection, restriction of gaze, diplopia, and visual loss from optic nerve compression are cardinal symptoms.
Histopathology shows follicular hyperplasia with scalloped margins on biopsy.
Management involves propylthiouracil is the mainstay of treatment for Graves' disease.
Radioactive iodine is also used as a treatment modality for hyperthyroidism in suitable patients but can aggravate Grave's ophthalmopathy.
other options:
option A: patients with Addison's disease usually present with complaints of fatigue, myalgias,
weight loss, and joint pain. Mineralocorticoid deficiency manifests as salt craving, dizziness due to hypotension, and abdominal pain. Excess AcTH stimulation results in hyperpigmentation of
exposed areas of the skin such as palmar creases and dorsal foot. Hyponatremia is a characteristic feature and is often associated with hyperkalemia.
option B: parkinson's disease is a degenerative condition of the dopamine-secreting neurons of the substantia nigra. patients present with muscular rigidity, involuntary resting tremors of the hands, akinesia - difficulty in initiating movement - and postural instability. on examination,    cog-wheel rigidity and a shuffling gait are seen.
option D: Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. It begins with memory impairment, which later progresses to language and visuospatial deficits. Later, the
patient has difficulty in keeping track of finances, following instructions, driving, shopping, and housekeeping. In severe impairment, the patient easily gets lost and confused disturbances and  cognitive impairment are also seen.",,C,
Q12,"For MDR-RR TB, what is the indication of short course bedaquiline?","a)Mutation only to INH A and kat G gene
b)Rifampicin sensitive
c)Extrapulmonary TB like tubercular meningitis","Resistance to rifampicin and sensitivity to fluoroquinolones is an indication of a short course of bedaquiline.
A shorter MDR-TB regimen of 6 months, BpaLM,  is the treatment of choice for MDR/ RR TB as per the latest WHo guidelines.

Q13,"In a patient with type 1 diabetes with 3rd stage beta cell damage, which of the following situations is associated with the same?","a)Autoimmune positive with dysglycemia
b)Autoimmune positive with normoglycemia
c)Autoimmune negative with normoglycemia
d)Autoimmune negative with dysglycemia","In type 1 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune positivity with dysglycemia indicates stage 3, where
clinical diabetes has become evident. This advanced stage is characterized by significant beta cell destruction and insulin deficiency, resulting in symptomatic diabetes.
Individuals with a genetic predisposition are exposed to a trigger that initiates an autoimmune process, leading to the production of islet autoantibodies and a progressive decline in beta cell  function.
stages of type 1 diabetes mellitus are:
stage 1: It is marked by the presence of two or more islet cell autoantibodies, such as antibodies against zinc transporter (ZnT-8 antibodies), islet cell antibodies (IcA), anti-glutamic acid
decarboxylase antibodies (GAD) and insulin autoantibodies (IAA) while glucose levels remain normal.
stage 2: It involves ongoing autoimmunity and the onset of dysglycemia, where glucose regulation becomes impaired but does not yet meet the criteria for diabetes. This stage reflects a decline in
beta cell function but is not yet characterised by the full-blown clinical symptoms of diabetes.
stage 3: It is defined by the development of hyperglycemia that exceeds the diagnostic criteria for  diabetes, indicating significant beta cell destruction and the onset of symptomatic diabetes. At this stage, patients have both autoimmune markers and impaired glucose regulation, confirming
advanced disease progression.",,A,
Q14,"An alcoholic patient presented to the emergency in an unconscious state. Relatives stated that he had a similar episode of binge drinking one week back. on examination, his glucose was

• wernicke’s encephalopathy: It is more commonly seen in alcoholics with chronic thiamine deficiency. It is characterized by:
• Global confusion
• Truncal ataxia
• ophthalmoplegia
• Horizontal nystagmus
• korsakoff psychosis: symptoms in addition to those of wernicke's encephalopathy include:
• Memory loss
• Confabulation
• Beriberi: It can present with:
• Dry beriberi: sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, muscle weakness
• wet beriberi: tachycardia, cardiomegaly, high-output cardiac failure",,A,
Q15,A patient came to the emergency department with dyspnea and palpitations. He is a known case of chronic kidney disease. ECG of the patient is given below. what is the diagnosis?,"a)Hyperkalemia
b)Hypokalemia
c)Hypocalcemia
d)Hypercalcemia","The given clinical presentation and the tall T waves on ECG indicate hyperkalemia, which is commonly seen in a patient with chronic kidney disease.
The causes of hyperkalemia are given below -
Intra- to extracellular shift -
• Acidosis
• Hyperosmolality; radiocontrast, hypertonic dextrose, mannitol
• β2-Adrenergic antagonists (non-cardioselective agents)
• Digoxin and related glycosides (yellow oleander, foxglove, bufadienolide)
• Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis
• Rapid tumour lysis
Inadequate excretion
• Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis; which increases the risk of hyperkalemia
when used in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, renin-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor(spironolactone,  eplerenone, drospirenone), blockade of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)(amiloride,
triamterene, trimethoprim, pentamidine, nafamostat)
• Advanced renal insufficiency




•
primary adrenal insufficiency
•
Renal resistance to mineralocorticoid
The steps of management are as follows -
• Immediate antagonism of the cardiac effects of hyperkalemia: calcium raises the action potential threshold and reduces excitability, without changing the resting membrane potential, thereby
reversing the depolarizing blockade due to potassium. 1o mL of 1o% calcium gluconate should be infused intravenously over 2-3 mins with cardiac monitoring. Effects start in 1-3 mins.
• Rapid reduction of plasma K+ concentration by redistribution into cells: Insulin shifts K+ into    the cells; 1o units of intravenous regular insulin followed by 5o mL of 5o% dextrose. Effects start in 1o-2o mins.
β2-agonists with insulin have additive effects on potassium concentration. 1o-2o mg of nebulized albuterol in 4 mL of normal saline, inhaled over 1o mins. Effects start at 3o mins
• Removal of potassium: cation exchange resins such as sodium polysterone sulfonate (SpS)    exchange Na+ for K+ in the GI tract and increase fecal excretion of K+. 15-3o g of powder in a suspension with 33% sorbitol
Hemodialysis is the most reliable and effective method other options:
option B: Hypokalemia is defined as a plasma concentration of K+ &lt;3.5 meq/L. common causes include metabolic alkalosis, insulin infusions, diarrhoea, use of diuretics, starvation, and
β2-agonists.EcG changes include ST depression, prominent U waves, and prolonged repolarization.


option c: Hypocalcemia causes prolongation of the QT interval. There is a lengthening of the ST segment, while the T wave (which correlates with the time for repolarization) remains unaltered.

Q16,"A 5o-year-old female presented with dyspnea and angina episodes. on workup, she is found to have aortic stenosis. which of the following findings favor the diagnosis of aortic stenosis over aortic regurgitation?","a)Increase in preload causes more reduction in myocardial oxygen demand than increase in afterload
b)workload has nothing to do with myocardial o2 consumption
c)Aortic stenosis causes reduced pressure than aortic valve
d)Increase in myocardial o2 consumption is seen with increased pressure work than volume","In evaluating the case of a 5o-year-old female presenting with dyspnea and angina episodes, it is    essential to differentiate between aortic stenosis (AS) and aortic regurgitation (AR). The key factor to consider in aortic stenosis(AS) is that increased myocardial oxygen consumption is more closely associated with increased pressure work rather than increased volume.
AS is the narrowing of the aortic valve. It may be caused due to the calcification of the normal
aortic valve, calcification of the congenital bicuspid valve, and rheumatic heart disease. In AS, the  heart works harder to overcome the elevated pressure gradient between the left ventricle (LV) and the aorta, leading to increased myocardial oxygen demand. This is in contrast to AR, where the
primary issue is volume overload rather than pressure overload.
Three cardinal clinical features of aortic stenosis are:
• Exertional dyspnea - this occurs due to left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. Raised
end-diastolic LV volume and reduced LV compliance lead to increased LV pressure, leading to elevation of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
• Angina pectoris - it occurs due to the combination of the increased o2 needs of hypertrophied myocardium and reduction of o2 delivery.
• Syncope - it occurs due to the combination of decreased cardiac output and systemic arterial dilation which lead to a reduction of cerebral perfusion.
The progression of AS involves a gradual narrowing of the valve orifice, which increases pressure work for the LV and leads to concentric hypertrophy as an adaptive response. This process, akin  to vascular atherosclerosis, involves endothelial dysfunction, lipid accumulation, and
inflammation, contributing to the valve's calcification and eventual stenosis. The pathophysiology of AS results in a significant systolic pressure gradient across the aortic valve. Initially, this



pressure gradient leads to LV hypertrophy as the heart compensates for the increased afterload.   over time, however, this compensatory mechanism becomes maladaptive, leading to decreased    LV function and heart failure symptoms. In severe cases, symptoms such as exertional dyspnea,   angina, and syncope may develop, reflecting the increased myocardial oxygen demand due to the elevated pressure work.",4582-2862.PNG,D,
Q17,"A patient presented with fatigue and tingling sensation in the arms, weight loss and h/o    polyuria. The following findings were detected on bone marrow biopsy. what is probable cause ?","a)subacute combined degeneration due to cobalamin deficiency
b)Multiple myeloma
c)subacute degeneration due to diabetes
d)Megaloblastic anemia","The given clinical scenario and marrow aspirate with plasma cells suggest multiple myeloma. The clinical features of fatigue, tingling sensation in the arms, weight loss, and polyuria are due to
hypercalcemia.
plasma cell dyscrasias are B-cell proliferations that contain neoplastic plasma cells that secrete a monoclonal Ig or Ig fragment. Multiple myeloma is a malignant neoplasm of plasma cells
characterized by monoclonal immunoglobulin or light chains in the serum and urine. It is a disease of older adults, with a peak age of incidence of 65 to 7o years.
signs and symptoms include hypercalcemia, fractures/ lytic bone lesions, renal failure and anaemia.
Investigations reveal:
• Radiography - punched-out lytic lesions on X-ray
• Electrophoresis - Monoclonal elevation of one immunoglobulin
• urinalysis - Free kappa and lambda light chains (Bence Jones proteins)
• Bone marrow biopsy - 1o to 2o% plasma cells (normal is &lt; 5%)
• peripheral smear - Rouleaux formation. A high level of M proteins in myeloma causes red cells in the peripheral blood smears to stick to one another in linear arrays, a finding referred to as     rouleaux formation.
plasma cell tumours are positive for CD138.
Morphology:
Myeloma cell size varies from small differentiated cells to large immature and undifferentiated
cells. plasmablasts with vesicular nuclear chromatin and a prominent single nucleolus, or bizarre, multinucleated cells may predominate. other cytologic variants include flame cells and Mott cells.
Flame cells have fiery red cytoplasm, and Mott cells are with multiple grape-like cytoplasmic droplets. other inclusions include fibrils, crystalline rods, and globules.
Image showing Mott cell:





The globular inclusions are Russell bodies (if cytoplasmic) or Dutcher bodies (if nuclear). Rouleaux formation is characteristic but not specific.

Q18,"A 6o-year-old patient presents with dyspnea and chest pain. The pleural fluid analysis shows pleural protein/ serum protein &gt; o.5, and pleural LDH/ serum LDH &gt; o.4. what is the    diagnosis?","a)congestive heart failure
b)chronic kidney disease
c)Liver cirrhosis
d)Tuberculosis","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of an exudative pleural effusion according to Light's criteria. Among the given options, tuberculosis can lead to exudative pleural effusion.
In any patient diagnosed with a pleural effusion, an effort should be made to find the cause. This requires a diagnostic thoracocentesis and analysis of the pleural fluid in terms of whether it is a   transudate or an exudate based on Light's criteria:
• pleural fluid protein/serum protein &gt;o.5
• pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH &gt;o.6
• pleural fluid LDH is more than two-thirds the upper limit of normal for serum
If the pleural fluid meets one of these criteria, it is considered exudative pleural effusion.
sometimes, special investigations like ADA and cytology might be required to rule out
tuberculosis and malignancy respectively.
For thoracocentesis, a posterior approach is preferred. The patient should sit on the edge of the    bed, leaning forward with the arms abducted onto a pillow on a bedside stand. The patient might have severe dyspnea, so it is important to assess whether they can maintain this position for 1o
minutes before performing the procedure. The entry site for the thoracocentesis is at the superior aspect of the rib. This prevents any injury to the intercostal nerve and vessels.
while maintaining gentle negative pressure, the needle should be slowly advanced into the pleural space. If a diagnostic tap is being performed, 3o-5o mL of fluid will be adequate. If a therapeutic    thoracocentesis is being performed, a maximum of 1 litre of pleural fluid should be withdrawn at a given time. withdrawal of quantities more than this can cause re-expansion pulmonary edema. A   chest radiograph should be obtained post-procedure to evaluate for a pneumothorax. The patient   should be instructed to inform the doctors if new shortness of breath develops.

Q19,"An adolescent presented with fever, purpura on the thigh, swelling of the right knee and left    ankle, and abnormal and diastolic murmur in the cardiac apical area. He was seronegative for rheumatoid factor. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)Acute rheumatic fever
b)Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
c)Rheumatoid arthritis
d)seronegative arthropathy","The adolescent's symptoms, which include fever, purpura, swelling of joints (right knee and left ankle), and abnormal heart sounds, are indicative of acute rheumatic fever (ARF)
Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is an inflammatory disease that can develop after a Group A
streptococcal infection, such as strep throat. It commonly affects the heart, joints, skin, and
central nervous system. symptoms include fever, migratory arthritis (joint swelling and pain), and carditis. The presence of abnormal heart sounds, such as diastolic murmurs, suggests valvular
involvement, typically of the mitral valve. ARF can also present with skin manifestations like purpura.
other options:
option B: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis typically presents with persistent joint swelling and stiffness, not with the acute symptoms or heart involvement seen in ARF.
option C: Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease that primarily affects adults,    though juvenile forms exist. It usually presents with symmetrical joint involvement and positive rheumatoid factor in many cases, which is absent in this patient.

ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis, which typically involve the spine and entheses rather than the acute joint swelling, purpura, and heart involvement seen in ARF.",,A,
Q20,"A patient came with complaints of easy fatiguability, anemia, hyperpigmentation of knuckles, oral mucosa, palm and hands, and tachycardia. The blood pressure of the patient is 8o/6o
mm Hg and Na+ 13o meq/L. what is the most probable diagnosis?","a)conn's syndrome
b)primary adrenal insufficiency
c)vitamin B12 deficiency
d)cushing syndrome","The given clinical scenario of a patient with easy fatiguability, skin and soft
tissue hyperpigmentation, and a low blood pressure and hyponatremia is suggestive of primary adrenal insufficiency(Addison's disease).
primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) is most commonly due to autoimmune
adrenalitis. These patients are likely to develop other autoimmune diseases such as vitiligo,
premature ovarian failure, and autoimmune thyroid disease. other causes of Addison's disease include destruction of the adrenal gland due to infections such as TB, hemorrhage
(waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome due to meningococcemia) or infiltration.
secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs due to hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction. This can
include iatrogenic suppression due to chronic therapy with glucocorticoids, or because of pituitary and hypothalamic tumors. pituitary apoplexy because of hypovolemic shock during parturition
(sheehan syndrome) can also cause secondary adrenal insufficiency.
The patients present with fatigue and loss of energy. primary adrenal insufficiency causes
hyperpigmentation due to excess ACTH, which stimulates the melanocytes to produce more
pigment. Hyperpigmentation is maximally seen in areas exposed to sunlight or that which
undergo friction. However, secondary adrenal insufficiency presents with skin paleness due to the complete absence of ACTH. The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is established by the ACTH
stimulation test.
ACTH stimulation test (also known as the short cosyntropin test or short synacthen test) involves the administration of an exogenous, synthetic peptide that has an activity similar to ACTH on the adrenal glands. serum cortisol levels are measured prior to, and after the administration of the
synthetic peptide. Cortisol levels lower than the cut-off value indicate a failure of the adrenal
glands to increase the production of cortisol in response to synthetic ACTH — thus confirming the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Note that this will be seen in both primary and secondary
adrenal insufficiency.
primary and secondary adrenal insufficiencies can be differentiated biochemically:
Treatment is with oral hydrocortisone 15-25 mg/day in 2-3 divided doses. Long-acting agents are   not preferred because they cause receptor activation even when the cortisol levels are supposed to be physiologically low in the body. Mineralocorticoid replacement is done with fludrocortisone
1oo-15o μg.
other options
option A: primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn syndrome), is characterized by excessive production of aldosterone by the adrenal glands. patients commonly present with fatigue, muscle weakness,    headaches, palpitations, and high blood pressure. Hypokalemia can cause muscle cramps,
weakness, and even paralysis in severe cases. The diagnosis is suspected based on clinical
presentation and laboratory findings of elevated plasma aldosterone and suppressed plasma renin activity.



option C: vitamin B12 deficiency can cause subacute combined degeneration. patients present
with sensory ataxia (involvement of the dorsal column) and UMN type of motor symptoms such as spasticity and positive Babinski sign (involvement of corticospinal tract). Because of coexisting
peripheral neuropathy, deep tendon reflexes can be absent. some patients also develop cortical    defects such as dementia. These patients can also have skin hyperpigmentation, but the presence of hyponatremia and low blood pressure makes this unlikely.
option D: Cushing's syndrome is characterized by clinical features that result from chronic     exposure to excess glucocorticoids that can be due to prolonged exogenous administration of glucocorticoids, excess endogenous cortisol secretion, and ectopic ACTH production. Clinical features include moon facies, purple skin striae, abnormal masculinization (acne, bruising,    enlargement of the clitoris in girls), pubertal developmental delay and amenorrhea in girls,    proximal muscle weakness, osteoporosis, hypertension, hyperpigmentation, hypokalemic
alkalosis, hyperglycemia.

Q21,"A female presents with choreo-athetoid movements, dysarthria, and dystonia with the given finding. which of the following is the best investigation to confirm the same?","a)serum ceruloplasmin levels
b)Hepatic copper content
c)24-hour urinary excretion of copper
d)Blood copper levels","The given clinical scenario along with the image showing the kayser–Fleischer ring, is suggestive of wilson's disease and the best investigation to confirm the same is by measuring the hepatic
copper content.
The diagnosis of wilson's disease is based on the following:
• Increased 24-hour urinary excretion of copper (the most specific screening test)(option C)
• Increase in hepatic copper content (the most sensitive and accurate test)
• A decrease in serum ceruloplasmin(option A)
• kayser–Fleischer rings
• Genetic testing for mutations in the ATp7B gene
serum copper levels are of no diagnostic use since they may be low, normal, or elevated depending on the stage of the disease. (option D)
wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by loss of function mutation of the
ATp7B gene, which codes for the enzyme copper-transporting ATpase present on the hepatocyte canalicular membrane.



In general, the free copper is taken up by hepatocytes and incorporated to form ceruloplasmin gets released into the bloodstream, and accounts for 9o% to 95% of plasma copper. Excess
hepatic copper gets transported into the bile and eventually excreted in the faeces.
The defect in the ATP7B gene impairs copper transport into the bile, its incorporation into
ceruloplasmin, and secretion of ceruloplasmin into the blood. This results in a decrease in
circulating ceruloplasmin levels and increased levels of hepatic copper. Total serum copper level may be decreased due to the deficiency in ceruloplasmin.
The excessive accumulation of copper injures the hepatocytes. This in turn releases the
non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper into the bloodstream, which later gets deposited in tissues like the basal ganglia of the brain and the cornea. This results in behavioural disturbances as well as  extrapyramidal symptoms and the characteristic KF ring that is seen on slit-lamp examination.
There is a marked compensatory urinary copper excretion. However, these levels do not suffice to prevent the deposition of copper in tissues.",4205-2685.PNG,B,

conducted and on cardiac biopsy, the left ventricle was hypertrophied. Identify the possible cause for the same.","a)Ischemic cardiomyopathy
b)Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia
c)Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
d)Takotsubo cardiomyopathy","The given clinical scenario and autopsy findings are suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The image given is a histologic section of cardiac muscle showing myocyte disarray and extreme hypertrophy as seen in HCM.
HCM is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. It is defined as left ventricular  hypertrophy of &gt;15mm on ECHO. The left ventricular myocardium is poorly compliant. This      leads to abnormal diastolic filling and intermittent ventricular outflow obstruction, i.e.,  primarily diastolic dysfunction.
The gross features of HCM are:
• Massive myocardial hypertrophy usually without ventricular dilation
• Asymmetric septal hypertrophy- disproportionate thickening of the ventricular septum relative to the left ventricle free wall
• Banana-shaped left ventricle- due to bulging of the ventricular septum into the lumen
The image given below shows changes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy compared to a normal heart. HCM shows asymmetric septal hypertrophy and a thickened left ventricle wall.





Histologic features of the HCM are:
• Massive myocyte hypertrophy- with transverse myocyte diameters frequently greater than 4o
μm, normal is approximately 15 μm.
• Myofiber disarray- haphazard disarray of bundles of myocytes, individual myocytes, and contractile elements in sarcomeres within cells
• Interstitial fibrosis and replacement fibrosis

Q23,"A patient suffered from RTA. After a few days, he had exaggerated right-sided extensor plantar reflex and knee jerk. what other finding would be seen?","a)Ankle clonus in right foot
b)proprioception lost in left leg
c)pain and temperature was lost in right leg
d)Fasciculations in right foot","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of an upper motor lesion secondary to trauma and ankle clonus in the right foot will be seen in this patient along with other clinical findings.
An upper motor neuron (UMN) refers to corticospinal tract neurons and brainstem neurons that    control spinal motor neurons. UMN lesion is characterized by signs such as spasticity, hypertonia, and hyperreflexia, indicating a disruption in the neural pathways that control voluntary
movement. These lesions can result from various conditions, including stroke, trauma, or degenerative diseases.
In a normal response to uncomfortable or painful stimulation of the foot, there is plantar flexion of the toes, often accompanied by flexion withdrawal of the limb. However, with a UMN lesion,   the response will be an extensor plantar response, known as a positive Babinski sign,
characterized by extension of the great toe and possibly fanning of other toes, along with contraction of the tensor fascia lata.
clonus is a rhythmic oscillatory series of muscle contractions that is induced by stretching the
tendon. It can be elicited in many joints but is most commonly seen in the ankle joint by suddenly dorsiflexing the foot and maintaining light upward pressure. It is seen in UMN lesions and is
associated with other signs of UMN lesions like spasticity.",,A,

b)Microcytic hypochromic anemia
c)Romberg's sign positive
d)subacute combined degeneration","After complete ileal resection, a patient with fatigue is unlikely to have microcytic anemia. In contrast, the patient is likely to have macrocytic anemia due to B12 deficiency.
vitamin B12 is absorbed in the ileum. vitamin B12 binds to intrinsic factor, a protein secreted by   the parietal cells of the stomach, and the complex is absorbed across the ileal mucosa. Hence after ileal resection, there is impaired absorption of vitamin B12.
vitamin B12 deficiency can cause subacute combined degeneration(option D). patients present    with sensory ataxia (involvement of the dorsal column) and UMN-type motor symptoms such as spasticity and positive Babinski sign (involvement of corticospinal tract). Because of coexisting    peripheral neuropathy, deep tendon reflexes can be absent. some patients also develop cortical   defects such as dementia.
Its deficiency can manifest as pernicious anemia, dementia, spinal cord degeneration, and homocysteinemia.
other options:
option A: vitamin B12 deficiency shows hypersegmented neutrophils (&gt;5 lobes), ovalocytes, and some amount of cyto-nuclear dyssynchrony.





option C: In the Romberg test, the standing patient is asked to close their eyes. An increased loss of balance is interpreted as a positive Romberg's test. It tests the proprioception, which requires   dorsal columns of the spinal cord. Hence, with the involvement of the dorsal column due to
vitamin B12 deficiency, the Romberg's sign is seen.",,B,4619-2884.PNG;4619-2883.PNG
Q25,A patient came with a history of dyspnea. His CT scan is shown below. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)Mediastinal mass invading vascular structures
b)Thrombosed arch of aorta
c)Mediastinal mass with fat and calcification
d)This is characteristic of mediastinal Hydatid cyst","In a patient with dyspnea, a CT scan shows a mediastinal mass with an attenuation of -62 HU, indicative of fat content, along with areas of calcification. This suggests the presence of a
mediastinal mass comprised of fat and calcified tissue.
Thymic neoplasms usually are detected in the anterior mediastinum. Fewer than 4% of thymic tumors occur in the middle mediastinum, defined as mediastinal space surrounded by the left  brachiocephalic vein, superior vena cava, esophagus, trachea, and main bronchus up to the



cross-section of the left brachiocephalic vein and the center of the trachea. Thymic carcinoma is a rare thymic neoplasm. Moreover, few reports of middle mediastinal thymic carcinomas are
histopathologically diagnosed as having immunohistochemical features.
other options:
option A: The CT shows a mediastinal mass but no clear evidence of vascular invasion.
option B: It shows a picture of a mediastinal mass rather than aorta.
option D: A mediastinal hydatid cyst on a chest CT can confirm the diagnosis by objectifying a
mass of fluid density, often very limited, unmodified by the injection of contrast, however,
contrast uptake by a pericyst can be observed. The presence of peripheral calcifications supports    the diagnosis. A predilection for the posterior compartment of the mediastinum has been reported in the literature.",4586-2864.PNG,C,

5.5 are suggestive of metabolic acidosis due to type 1 renal tubular acidosis (RTA).
Metabolic acidosis associated with RTA I has a normal serum anion gap due to impaired urinary  acidification. It is also associated with hypercalciuria. The hypercalciuria leads to a tendency to     form calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones. The patients can also have recurrent UTIs     and hematuria. The urinary anion gap is positive in these cases, and urine pH is greater than 5.5.",,A,
Q27,"A 36-year-old girl presented with tremors and weight loss. Her ophthalmic examination

b)Medial rectus is the first muscle to be involved.
c)The muscles and connective tissue around the eye shares similar antigen with diseased organ
d)More common in males","The clinical scenario of tremors, weight loss, and the image showing exophthalmos are suggestive of Graves ophthalmopathy. The muscles and connective tissue around the eye share similar
antigens with diseased organ i.e. Thyroid.
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors have been found in the orbit's connective tissues    and fibroblasts. TSH stimulates the production of inflammatory cytokines. Thyroid eye disease is considered an autoimmune disease where orbital fibroblasts are the primary target and
extraocular muscles are secondarily involved. Thyroid follicular cells and orbital fibroblasts likely share a common antigen.
TAo is also linked to increased glycosaminoglycan synthesis, which results in restrictive
myopathy. Fat accumulation is caused by orbital fibroblast proliferation and differentiation into adipocytes.
Graves ophthalmopathy, also known as dysthyroid eye illness or thyroid-associated
ophthalmopathy (TAo), is one of the most serious ocular manifestations of Graves disease.
Between the ages of 25 and 5o, it's the leading cause of unilateral and bilateral proptosis in adults. It is seen in 1o% of cases without hyperthyroidism.
proptosis, eyelid retraction, lid retraction, lid lag on downgaze, restricted myopathy, and perhaps compressive optic neuropathy are clinical manifestations that could potentially be used for
diagnosis.



American Thyroid Association (ATA) has classified Graves’ ophthalmopathy, irrespective of the
hormonal status into the following classes. This classification is also known as werner
classification which reflects the severity of the ophthalmopathy and is well known by the acronym No SPECS.
Treatment of thyroid ophthalmopathy:
other options
option A: Thyroid eye disease is associated with HLA-DR3 and HLA-B8.
option B: The most common ocular motility defect is unilateral elevator palsy due to involvement of the inferior rectus followed by limitation of abduction due to medial rectus palsy.

Q28,"A patient presented to the casualty with chest pain and palpitations. His blood pressure was 13o/9ommHg and pulse rate- 1o1bpm. Echocardiography showed a collapse of the right
atrium during diastole. what is the most appropriate management for this patient?","a)NSAIDs
b)pericardiocentesis
c)chest tube insertion or thoracotomy
d)Steroids","The patient in the clinical vignette with chest pain and palpitations, stable vitals and
echocardiography findings of the diastolic collapse of the right atrium is suggestive of cardiac tamponade, and the most appropriate management will be pericardiocentesis.
Cardiac tamponade is characterised by the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space, leading  to impaired diastolic relaxation of the cardiac chambers. This leads to a decline in cardiac output.
pericardiocentesis, also known as pericardial tap, is performed with sub-xiphoid, parasternal, or apical approaches. The most common approach is a sub-xiphoid approach under
echocardiographic guidance. As a preparatory step, IV saline should be administered to the
patient, and intrapericardial pressure should be measured without delaying the treatment, as the   condition can be fatal. The fluid should be completely drained, and a multiholed catheter is left in situ to drain the fluid which re-accumulates. The fluid obtained should be sent for analysis.
The echocardiography shows a swinging heart sign, which is characteristic of cardiac tamponade. The pericardial pressures exceed the left ventricular diastolic filling pressures, causing the
collapse of heart chambers, IVC plethora, and respiratory variation in volumes and flows.


other options:
option A - NSAIDs can be given for pain management, but the primary aim is to reduce the
pressure on the heart by urgent pericardiocentesis or surgical drainage. They can, however, be used in uremic pericarditis along with dialysis.
option C- Intercostal chest tube drainage is done in tension pneumothorax, which is a close
differential diagnosis for cardiac tamponade where there will be reduced air entry and mediastinal shift.
option D: Steroids are not used in the management of acute cardiac tamponade. They can be used in pericardial effusion secondary to rheumatological and inflammatory diseases like SLE,
rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and polyarteritis nodosa to prevent inflammation and reaccumulation of fluid.",,B,4622-2885.PNG

consumption of alcohol. Given below is the chest X-ray of the patient. what is the most probable diagnosis?","a)Aspiration pneumonia
b)Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema
c)Miliary tuberculosis
d)Bilateral pulmonary embolism","The given clinical scenario of an alcoholic patient with epigastric pain radiating to the back,
elevated amylase and lipase with the chest X-ray findings of diffuse bilateral lung opacities is
suggestive of non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema or ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) secondary to acute pancreatitis.
Acute pancreatitis gives rise to inflammatory processes and endothelial damage that result in
proteinaceous interstitial oedema. unlike cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, this does not clear with diuretic therapy and persists for days to weeks. Early findings on a chest X-ray may be normal or   may have diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities, obscuring the pulmonary vascular markings which progress later to a more diffuse and extensive consolidation.
Clinical disorders commonly associated with ARDS:
• Direct lung injury: pneumonia, aspiration of gastric contents, pulmonary contusion, near-drowning, toxic inhalation injury.
• Indirect lung injury: Sepsis, severe trauma- multiple fractures, flail chest, head trauma, burns, multiple transfusions, drug overdose, pancreatitis, post-cardiopulmonary bypass
other options:
option A: Aspiration pneumonia results from aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric contents into the lower respiratory tract. Although it is more common in alcoholics, the clinical history of the     patient suggests pancreatitis, making ARDS a more likely diagnosis. Below is a chest X-ray
showing diffuse opacities in the right middle and lower lobes.


option C: The chest radiograph given below shows extensive bilateral reticulonodular infiltrates seen in miliary tuberculosis, which is the widespread dissemination of tuberculosis via the

Q30,what is the most likely cause of death in a patient suffering from Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"a)pulmonary hypertension
b)pulmonary embolism
c)Respiratory failure
d)Lung carcinoma","The most likely cause of death in a patient suffering from Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is respiratory failure.
The natural history is usually of steady decline, however, some patients present with acute
exacerbations manifesting as dyspnea, impaired gas exchange, or a new consolidation on
HRCT(High-Resolution CT).In advanced cases, patients may develop pulmonary hypertension and features of right heart failure. The finding of high numbers of fibroblastic foci on biopsy is
suggestive of more rapid deterioration.
IPF is the most common interstitial lung disease occurring due to an unknown cause. The patients are usually over 6o years of age and present with progressive exertional dyspnea and dry cough.    on examination, fine inspiratory, velcro crackles may be heard. Digital clubbing and cyanosis are   signs of advanced disease.
Pulmonary function tests (PFT) will show a restrictive deficit and reduction of TLC, FEV1, and   FVC. HRCT shows predominant subpleural and basal involvement in the form of reticulation,    honeycombing, and traction bronchiectasis. Pirfenidone inhibits TGF-beta1-stimulated collagen synthesis and has anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory &amp; anti-oxidant effects. It is also used to   manage acute exacerbations of pulmonary hypertension along with slowing the progression of   IPF. Nintedanib is another drug also used for IPF based on the mechanism of tyrosine kinase     inhibition. However, it carries a poor prognosis.

Q32,"A patient presented to the OPD with a temperature of 102 °F, and a cough with foul-smelling sputum. On examination, clubbing is present. His chest X-ray is given below. what is the
probable diagnosis?","a)Pneumothorax
b)pneumatocele
c)Empyema
d)Lung abscess","The clinical scenario of the patient with fever, cough with foul-smelling sputum, clubbing and a chest X-ray showing air-fluid level is suggestive of a lung abscess.
A lung abscess is caused by microbial infection, leading to necrosis and cavitation of the lung.
These could either occur following aspiration or secondary to bronchial obstruction by a foreign body or malignancies, often in the background of immunosuppression. The patients usually
present with complaints of fever, cough with sputum, and chest pain. If the lung abscess is putrid, it may produce discoloured and foul-smelling sputum. chronic cases may present with anaemia,    night sweats and fatigue. patients usually have poor dental hygiene and gingival disease.
Examination findings include clubbing, absent gag reflex, and cavernous breath sounds.
Radiological features of lung abscess:
• A lung cavity with an air-fluid level
• The cavity wall is thick and irregular with a surrounding pulmonary infiltrate and acute angle to the chest wall.
• computed tomography (cT) is more sensitive than chest radiography and is used to detect small cavities
The X-ray image given below shows thick-walled cavities with air-fluid levels on lateral view.


other options:
option A: In pneumothorax, the patient will present with a history of breathlessness, and chest     X-ray will show deep costophrenic angle, hyperlucency (darker area without lung markings) with  inward shifting of the visceral pleural line (sharp white line). In tension pneumothorax, there will be a mediastinal shift to the opposite side.
The image below shows a left pneumothorax with total left lung collapse and tracheal deviation to the right.





option B: pneumatoceles are thin-walled cavities in the lung parenchyma that are seen in
respiratory tract infections, most often caused by staphylococcus aureus in children and
pneumocystis jirovecii in immunocompromised adults. Given below is the chest X-ray showing pneumatocele.


option C: Empyema is the collection of pus in the pleural cavity. It is usually associated with
pneumonia but may also develop after thoracic surgery or thoracic trauma. At the margins ofthe   empyema, the pleura can be seen dividing into parietal and visceral layers, the split pleura sign. It is the most sensitive and specific sign on CT and helps distinguish an empyema from a peripheral lung abscess.
The image given below shows a split pleura sign of empyema.",4589-2867.PNG,D,4627-2891.PNG;4628-2892.PNG;4629-2893.PNG;4628-2892-1.png
Q33,"A young athlete presented with chest pain and dyspnea. His brother passed away due to
sudden cardiac death. He is diagnosed with HCM. A harsh systolic murmur is heard in the left sternal border. which of the following will increase the murmur?","a)squatting
b)Leaning forward with head down/up
c)Hand grip
d)valsalva","The clinical vignette of an athlete with chest pain and dyspnea whose family history is suggestive   of sudden cardiac death due to HCM and a harsh systolic murmur at the left sternal border are all in favour of HCM murmur. It increases in intensity while performing the valsalva manoeuvre.
The murmur of HCM is an ejection systolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border. The intensity of the mid-systolic murmur is
Increased by -valsalva strain phase, standing posture, and exercise
Decreased by - squatting, passive leg raising, and handgrip.
valsalva manoeuvre involves the performance of forced expiration against a closed glottis.
HCM is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. It is defined as left ventricular  hypertrophy of &gt;15mm on ECHO. The left ventricular myocardium is poorly compliant. This      leads to abnormal diastolic filling and intermittent ventricular outflow obstruction, i.e.,  primarily diastolic dysfunction.
Gross features of HCM:
• Massive myocardial hypertrophy usually without ventricular dilation
• Asymmetric septal hypertrophy- disproportionate thickening of the ventricular septum relative to the left ventricle free wall
• Banana-shaped left ventricle- due to bulging of the ventricular septum into the lumen
The image given below shows changes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy compared to a normal heart. HCM shows asymmetric septal hypertrophy and a thickened left ventricle wall.





Histologic features of the HCM:
Massive myocyte hypertrophy- with transverse myocyte diameters frequently greater than 4o μm, normal is approximately 15 μm.
Myofiber disarray- haphazard disarray of bundles of myocytes, individual myocytes, and contractile elements in sarcomeres within cells
Interstitial fibrosis and replacement fibrosis
The image given below is a histologic section of cardiac muscle showing myocyte disarray and extreme hypertrophy seen in an abnormal HCM septum.


pathophysiology:
HCM is characterized by reduced stroke volume due to impaired diastolic filling. Approximately     25% of patients with HCM have dynamic obstruction to the left ventricular outflow as the anterior mitral leaflet moves toward the ventricular septum during systole. The compromised cardiac



output in conjunction with a secondary increase in pulmonary venous pressure explains the exertional dyspnea seen in these patients.
Major clinical problems in HCM are atrial fibrillation, mural thrombus formation leading to embolization and stroke, cardiac failure, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death.
ECG - findings:
prominent abnormal Q waves
p wave abnormalities
Left axis deviation
Deeply inverted T waves
Echocardiography:
LV wall thickness ≥15 mm
systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve
LVOT obstruction
The management options in patients with HCM:
Beta-blockers
Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers
Disopyramide
Drugs to be avoided in patients with significant LVOT obstruction:
Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers
Nitroglycerin
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, ARBs
Diuretics
preventive intra-cardiac defibrillator is indicated for patients with HCM and documented cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia.

Q34,A patient presented with right upper and lower limb weakness with left sided facial nerve palsy and left sided horizontal gaze palsy. what is the probable diagnosis?,"a)Millard- Gubler syndrome
b)Benedikt's syndrome
c)Foville syndrome
d)Locked in syndrome","The given clinical scenario of a patient with right hemiplegia, left-sided facial nerve palsy, and left horizontal gaze palsy is suggestive of Foville syndrome or dorsal pontine syndrome.
Brainstem syndromes cause crossed hemiplegia with ipsilateral cranial nerve palsies and
contralateral hemiplegia. pontine syndromes occur due to the involvement of pontine branches of the basilar artery and anterior inferior cerebellar artery.
In Foville's syndrome, there is a dorsal pontine injury (lesion in the abducens nucleus) that causes lateral/ horizontal gaze palsy. In Millard-Gubler syndrome, there is a ventral pontine injury (lesion



in the abducens fascicle) that causes lateral rectus weakness.
Locked-in syndrome occurs when a pontine stroke causes quadriplegia and paralysis of all
voluntary muscles except vertical movements of the eyes and blinking. The vertical gaze nucleus, the rostral interstitial nucleus of medial longitudinal fasciculus, is located in the midbrain and is  hence preserved.

Q35,"A male patient presents with headaches and visual disturbance. The patient had frontal
bossing, thick palms, and soles, and gaping of central incisors. He is also hypertensive and diabetic. which of the following statements is true about screening investigations done on  this patient?","a)GH levels &lt;o.4 after 1 hour of 75 gm glucose tolerance test.
b)single early morning fasting level of GH is used to establish the diagnosis.
c)Age specific IGF-1 levels are useful for screening.
d)GH levels are used to assess the severity of the condition.","The given clinical scenario of a patient with hypertension and diabetes, and frontal bossing, thick palms and soles, and gaping of central incisors is suggestive of acromegaly. Age-specific IGF-1
levels are used as a screening test in this condition.
The confirmation of acromegaly is done by administering 75g of oral glucose load to the patient. Normally, GH should be suppressed to less than o.4 ug/L after the oral glucose load. A failure of suppression of growth hormone confirms the diagnosis of acromegaly.
Acromegaly is a result of growth hormone hypersecretion due to a pituitary adenoma. It can also   occur due to extra pituitary lesions. If growth hormone hypersecretion occurs before the fusion of the growth plates at puberty, it leads to gigantism.
Acral bony overgrowth in acromegaly manifests as frontal bossing, increased hand and foot size,   mandibular enlargement, prognathism, and widened space between incisors. soft tissue swelling   results in increased heel pad thickness, coarse facial features, and a large fleshy nose. Generalized visceromegaly is seen including cardiomegaly, macroglossia, thyroid enlargement, etc. serious
complications include diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnoea, and increased risk of colonic polyps and cancer.
The physiological actions of the growth hormone are mostly mediated through IGF-1, which is
synthesized in the liver. since the growth hormone is released in a pulsatile manner, serum IGF-1 levels are usually measured to assess growth hormone activity. serum IGF-1 level is decreased in   pituitary failure, defect or blockade of GH receptor. since the low-calorie state is associated with   growth hormone resistance, IGF-1 is also decreased in conditions such as cachexia, malnutrition,  and sepsis. serum IGF-1 level is increased in acromegaly.
Acromegaly can be treated by transsphenoidal resection of the tumor. It can also be managed    medically by using octreotide (a somatostatin analog), pegvisomant (Growth Hormone receptor antagonist), dopamine agonists, or radiation.
other options:



option A: A failure of suppression to &lt;o.4ng/ml using ultrasensitive assays or to &lt;1ng/ml using standard assays after an oral glucose load is used as a confirmatory test.
option B: since the growth hormone is released in a pulsatile manner, measurements of a single GH level are not used in the diagnosis of acromegaly.
option D: Though, GH levels &gt; 4o ng/ml indicate poor prognosis but it is not routinely done to assess the severity of acromegaly.",,C,
Q36,A person goes through routine tests while applying for a job. His ECG showed a PR interval of o.21 sec. what is the diagnosis?,"a)1st degree block
b)Normal ECG
c)2nd degree block
d)Complete heart block","Normal PR interval ranges between o.12 and o.2o seconds since this patient's ECG has a PR interval of o.21 s(prolonged), it is suggestive of a first-degree heart block.
This type of block is characterized by a fixed, prolonged PR interval without any dropped beats. It indicates a delay in conduction through the AV node, but all atrial impulses still reach the
ventricles. It is most often asymptomatic. Canon waves are observed in JVP. It carries a very good prognosis and no treatment is needed.
A heart block is caused by an interruption of impulse conduction within the conducting system of the heart. It may be sinoatrial, atrioventricular, or intraventricular. Atrioventricular blocks are
further divided into type I, type II, and type III blocks. The type II blocks are subdivided into Mobitz type I and Mobitz type II blocks.
other options:
option B: Normal ECG will show a PR interval between o.12 and o.2o seconds
option C: second-Degree AV Block Mobitz Type I (wenckebach). is characterized by a progressive prolongation of the PR interval until a beat is eventually dropped. This type of block is usually
benign and often does not require treatment.
second-degree AV Block Mobitz Type II involves intermittent dropped beats without the
progressive prolongation of the PR interval. It is often associated with a fixed PR interval and is more serious than Mobitz Type I because it has a higher risk of progressing to a complete heart  block.
option D: Third-degree AV Block also known as complete heart block, involves complete
dissociation between atrial and ventricular activity. The atria and ventricles beat independently of each other, which can result in severe bradycardia and require immediate medical intervention.",,A,
Q37,A woman presented with an irregularly irregular rhythm with a heart rate of 15o bpm. on auscultation P2 was loud and no murmur was heard. what would be the JVP finding?,"a)Rapid x descent
b)Absent a wave
c)Cannon a wave
d)Rapid y descent","The clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and the JVP finding seen would be absent a wave.
Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia. There is rapid and irregular atrial
activation which is transmitted through the atrioventricular node. The conducted ventricular rate is usually rapid and irregularly irregular. It can vary from 11o-16o beats/minute. A pulse deficit is an important clinical finding associated with the condition. This arises due to preload reduction.



Symptoms include palpitations, fatigue, presyncope, and dyspnea. An ECG shows the absence of P waves.


In acute atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic instability, electrical or chemical cardioversion is the first step. The latter is done by intravenous administration of class III antiarrhythmic - ibutilide.    In a stable patient, ventricular rate control is the primary aim. This is done by intravenous or oral  administration of beta-blockers. Calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and diltiazem can
also be used.
If the current episode duration is &gt;48 hours, cardioversion can precipitate thromboembolic complications. In such cases, cardioversion should be carried out only after 3 weeks of
anticoagulation. It has to be continued for 4 weeks after cardioversion. Another option is to evaluate the presence of a thrombus in the left atrial appendage. This can be done either by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or high-resolution CT.
If the duration is &lt;48 hours and there are no high-risk factors, cardioversion can be done. The CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system is used to assess stroke risk.
warfarin is recommended in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves who present with atrial fibrillation. In mitral stenosis, thrombi arise frequently from the dilated left atrium. Atrial fibrillation in the absence of mitral stenosis is known as nonvalvular atrial
fibrillation. oral factor xa inhibitors such as apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban can be used in such cases.
other options:
option A: Rapid x-descent is seen in Cardiac tamponade.
option C: Cannon a wave is seen in atrioventricular dissociation and contraction of the right atria against a closed tricuspid valve.
option D: Rapid y-descent is seen in Constrictive pericarditis and isolated severe tricuspid regurgitation.",,B,4604-2878.PNG
Q38,"A young man had a history of jaundice and raised HBsAg levels a year back. on follow-up
now, he has normal levels of liver enzymes. His current profile is shown in the image. what is the diagnosis for his current condition?","a)chronic HepB with HBe Ag negative
b)Resolved infection
c)chronic HepB with HBe Ag positive
d)Acute HepB","chronic hepatitis B with active viral replication has the following serological findings: HBsAg positive, Anti-HBs negative, Anti-HBc IgG positive, HBeAg positive.
After a person is infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), the first serologic marker to increase in level is HBsAg. It becomes detectable in the serum between 1-12 weeks. It becomes undetectable    1–2 months after the onset of jaundice and rarely persists beyond 6 months. once the HBsAg
becomes undetectable, the anti-HBs antibody starts rising in serum and remains detectable  indefinitely thereafter. The gap between the disappearance of HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs antibodies is called the window period.
However, if HBsAg persists beyond 6 months, it is likely to be chronic hepatitis B, marked as an orange line in the image.
HBcAg is located inside the cells and is usually enclosed within an HBsAg coat when present in the serum. As a result, HBcAg is not commonly detectable in the serum of patients with HBV     infection since naked core particles are not found in the bloodstream.
conversely, anti-HBc (red line) can be detected in the serum shortly after the emergence of HBsAg, usually within 1-2 weeks. Anti-HBc may be the only serologic marker useful for the
identification of HBV infection during the window period. Initially, the anti-HBc is of the IgM variety, but in chronic infections, it is of the IgG class.
HBeAg (green line) appears shortly after the appearance of HBsAg. Its appearance correlates with high levels of virus replication. Anti-HBe correlates with a period of lower infectivity or recovery    from the infection.
other options:
option A: chronic HepB with HBe Ag negative could be possible if there had not been a green line in the graph marked as HBeAg, which is persisting for more than 52 weeks.
option B: persistence of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) beyond 6 months indicates chronic infection (orange line), ruling out the possibility of a resolved infection.
option D: Acute Hepatitis B patient is unlikely to have a history dating back a year ago and persistent surface antigen.",4591-2869.PNG,C,
Q39,"A 4o-year-old female patient with a known case of myasthenia gravis on mycophenolate
mofetil and pyridostigmine now presents with breathing difficulties. Her calcium levels were 13.5g/dl. what is the most likely cause for the increase in calcium?","a)small cell carcinoma of lung
b)Drug induced hypercalcemia
c)parathyroid adenoma
d)Adenocarcinoma lung","The cause of hypercalcemia in the female with myasthenia gravis on mycophenolate mofetil and pyridostigmine is likely to be a parathyroid adenoma.
parathyroid adenomas cause primary hyperparathyroidism and may present as a solitary    adenoma or as a part of genetic syndromes like MEN syndromes(parathyroid hyperplasia).
Elevated parathyroid hormone increases blood calcium via bone resorption, intestinal absorption and renal reabsorption.
primary hyperparathyroidism is mostly asymptomatic. However, it may also present as painful bones (subperiosteal resorption, osteitis fibrosa cystica), renal stones, abdominal groans (pain, nausea, vomiting, heartburn), neuropsychiatric (irritability, paranoid delusion, depression),
fatigue, and proximal muscle weakness. Excess calcium can also deposit in the cornea



(band-shaped keratopathy), blood vessels (calciphylaxis), and extravascular tissues (calcinosis). other options:
options A and D: small cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the lung are not associated with hypercalcemia. squamous cell carcinoma is associated with hypercalcemia due to pTHrp.
option B: Mycophenolate mofetil or pyridostigmine are not known to cause hypercalcemia.",,C,
Q40,"A 35-year-old female with a history of hypertension presents with palpitations, dyspnea,
bilateral basal crackles and irregularly irregular pulse. EcG is given below. which among the following management is least useful?","a)cardioversion in a haemodynamically unstable patient
b)Direct oral anticoagulants
c)Beta blockers is to be given for rate control if patient is intolerant to calcium channel blockers
d)IV digoxin for ventricular rate control","In this patient presenting with palpitations, dyspnea bilateral basal crackles and irregular RR  intervals with absent p waves on ECG, the most likely diagnosis is acute decompensated heart failure with atrial fibrillation. Beta-blockers are not employed for rate control in patients with  acute heart failure.
Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers are negative ionotropic drugs. They cause decreased cardiac output, decreased blood pressure, and increased left ventricular filling pressure thereby   worsening acute heart failure. Beta-blockers are first-line therapy for rate control for Atrial
fibrillation in patients without acute heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a supraventricular tachycardia caused by ectopic foci or small reentry circuits within the atria. It has an atrial rate of 4oo-6oo/min and a ventricular rate of
1oo-16o/min.
Risk factors for developing AF include:
• Age- usually above 6o years of age
• underlying heart disease
• Hypertension
• Diabetes mellitus
• obesity
• sleep apnea
• post-cardiac surgery
• Inflammatory pericarditis
• Acute alcohol consumption.
Features include heart rate typically ranging from 11o-16o beats/minute. It is irregular and rapid.  presyncope and syncope can be seen. Thrombus formation can occur and thromboembolic events can take place.
Typically, ECG shows an absent p wave and irregular RR intervals.
Management is mainly by controlling the rate by using drugs like β blockers (such as metoprolol) and calcium channel blockers (such as diltiazem and verapamil). Reversion to sinus rhythm can   be done electrically or using medications. pharmacological cardioversion can be done using
ibutilide, dofetilide and amiodarone (class III antiarryhthmics) or flecainide and propafenone (class Ic drugs).



other options:
option A: synchronized cardioversion is the treatment of choice in haemodynamically unstable patients.
option B: Atrial fibrillation predisposes risk for thrombus formation, therefore appropriate
anticoagulation has to be started. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DoACs) are preferred over warfarin for anticoagulation. However, warfarin is the preferred drug if the patient has a
mechanical prosthetic valve, advanced CKD or moderate-severe mitral stenosis.
option D: Intravenous digoxin can be used to control the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation,
especially in patients with heart failure or those who are not suitable for beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers. However, digoxin is not always the first-line treatment for rate control.",4592-2870.PNG,C,4637-2897.PNG;4637-2896.PNG

b)propranolol
c)Diphenhydramine
d)Nitroprusside","This patient with a history of depression treated with sertraline and now amitryptiline most likely has developed serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is treated with cyproheptadine (5-HT2     receptor antagonist). Cyproheptadine can effectively treat serotonin syndrome by blocking the
effects of excess serotonin.
Serotonin syndrome is characterized by a triad of:
• Autonomic instability - hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, diaphoresis, vomiting, diarrhea.
• Altered mental status - agitation, confusion, delirium.
• Neuromuscular hyperactivity - tremor, hyperreflexia, myoclonus.
Serotonin syndrome rarely occurs with a single serotonergic drug used at therapeutic doses. More commonly, it occurs due to the combined side effects with any drug that increases serum
serotonin levels like MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors), SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), TCAs (tricyclic
antidepressants), tramadol, ondansetron, triptans, linezolid, MDMA (amphetamine), dextromethorphan, etc.",,A,
