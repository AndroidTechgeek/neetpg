Q1,The most common pattern of involvement in pott's spine is,"a)paradiscal
b)central
c)Anterior
d)posterior","The most common pattern of involvement in pott's spine is the paradiscal type.
pott's spine occurs secondary to a pulmonary or gastrointestinal primary and spreads through the Batson's plexus of veins (paravertebral plexus) and most commonly involves the dorso-lumbar
region.
Types of vertebral tuberculosis:
• paradiscal - contiguous areas of two adjacent vertebrae and the middle intervening disc are
affected. This is due to the high oxygen requirements of tubercular bacteria and the corresponding high blood supply in this region by the segmental vessels.
• central - the body of the vertebra is involved leading to collapse (causing wedging or concertina collapse) of the affected vertebra. This leads to spinal deformities such as kyphosis and gibbus.
• Anterior - the anterior part of the body is affected and spreads through the anterior longitudinal ligament.
• posterior - the posterior complex (pedicle, lamina, spinous process, and transverse process) is affected.
the image below shows various parts of the vertebra and patterns of involvement in pott's spine:






clinical features of spinal tuberculosis:
• Back pain, stiffness and reduced movements are the usual early complaints
• cautious gait - a person with spinal tuberculosis will walk carefully with short steps to avoid pain resulting from movement
• pott's paraplegia
• cold abscess
• concertina collapse - a type of compression fracture without involvement of the interverterbral disc
• Deformity - kyphus and gibbus (gradually increasing prominence).

Q2,Anterior dislocation of the shoulder is likely to result in the damage of which of the following nerves?,"a)Axillary nerve
b)Median nerve
c)Radial nerve
d)suprascapular nerve","Anterior shoulder dislocation is most likely to damage the axillary nerve.
Axillary nerve injury presents with an anaesthetic patch over the deltoid muscle, and deltoid   muscle weakness (inability to abduct at the shoulder joint). It is usually a neuropraxia type of injury and resolves spontaneously. other nerves that can be injured include the radial nerve,  musculocutaneous nerve, median nerve or ulnar nerve.
other complications of anterior dislocation of the shoulder joint:
• Early complications
• Rotator cuff injury is seen in older people and presents with difficult abduction (palpable contraction of deltoid muscle rules out nerve injury).
• vascular injury: Axillary artery may be injured, especially in older individuals, either at the time of injury or during the reduction.
• Fracture-dislocation: There may be an associated fracture of the humerus (e.g. greater
tuberosity) due to the traumatic injury. This may require open reduction and internal fixation.
• Late complications
• Recurrent dislocations: Most common sequelae of anterior dislocation. usually seen when there is associated injury to the glenoid labrum or stripping of the capsule is present.
• shoulder stiffness: Due to prolonged immobilization.
• untreated dislocation: sometimes it may go unnoticed, especially in older and unconscious  individuals. The reduction can be tried up to 6 weeks after the dislocation, after which 'active neglect' (no treatment) is followed.

Q3,A 6o year old patient presents with limping gait and left hip pain. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)Tuberculosis of the hip
b)Rheumatoid arthritis
c)Ankylosing spondylitis
d)Avascular necrosis","The given scenario of limping gait and left hip pain with radiographic findings of the radiolucency and distorted articular surface is suggestive of avascular necrosis of the head of femur.
Avascular necrosis (AVN) or osteonecrosis is a painful bone condition as a result of diminished blood supply mainly due to trauma or non-traumatic etiologies.
The typical features are pain with movements in or near the joint, click in the joint, joint stiffness, limping gait, and deformity. Restriction of movements is also a feature of this condition.
An x-ray shows reactive new bone formation, increased radiolucency in the subchondral bone, and a distorted articular surface.
MRI is the investigation of choice. It allows the identification of AVN of the femoral head and also determines the exact stage and extent of the pathologic process.
Management is based on Ficat and Arlet Classification:
other options:
option A: Tuberculosis of the hip is characterized by painful and restricted movements of the hip. The radiographic findings are not appreciable in the early stages. But late stages show
periarticular osteoporosis, hazy, and irregular joint margins with a reduction in the joint space, and wandering acetabulum.
option B: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is usually seen in females in the 4th to 5th decade. patients  present with symmetrical polyarthritis of the proximal finger joints, tenosynovitis, early morning stiffness and pain. RA of the hip can be bilateral. Radiographic findings such as joint space
narrowing due to hyaline cartilage destruction, cyst formation, and acetabular protrusion-type deformity can be seen.
option C: Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the spine and sacroiliac
joint. It typically occurs in the age group 15-25 years with a male preponderance. Features include backache, stiffness, sciatica, and fixed flexion contracture. Radiographic findings show erosion of



sacroiliac joints, squaring, and bridging of the vertebral body leading to a bamboo spine appearance.

Q4,A 72-year-old man came with complaints of unilateral knee pain. X-ray examination showed reduced joint space. pathological findings shown below are of:,"a)osteoarthritis
b)Tuberculosis of the knee
c)Rheumatoid arthritis
d)Lyme disease","The scenario of unilateral knee pain, the radiograph findings of reduced joint space, and the histopathology findings of loss of articular cartilage suggest osteoarthritis.
osteoarthritis is a type of joint disease characterized by degeneration of cartilage leading to
synovial joint destruction. Individuals with age &gt; 5o years and overweight are usually affected.
The disease typically involves the knee and initially affects a single joint; eventually, both knees
are affected. pain is the predominant symptom and worsens with use. other symptoms such as
joint stiffness, swelling, giving away or locking can be present. Fixed flexion deformity can be seen in these patients.
A radiograph of the knee joint, the anteroposterior and lateral view is useful to establish a
diagnosis. The characteristic findings are the diminution of joint space, subchondral sclerosis, subchondral cysts, osteophytes, and soft tissue calcifications.
Histopathology shows characteristic loss of the articular cartilage, congestion, fibrosis and inflammatory cells.
Management is as follows
• conservative measures such as weight loss, exercise, physiotherapy for strengthening of the
quadriceps muscle, analgesics for pain relief and usage of walking sticks for reducing the load of joints.
• Intraarticular injections of corticosteroids and hyaluronidase are useful.
• operative measures such as osteotomy and total knee replacement surgery.
other options:
option B: Tuberculosis of the knee is more common in childhood with pain and limping being the common symptoms. X-rays show an enlargement of the epiphysis. The characteristic
histopathologic findings are caseating and noncaseating granulomas with surrounding epithelioid and multinucleate giant cells.



The below image shows caseating granuloma with Langhans giant cells:


option C: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of the knee is less common. It is usually seen in females in the 4th to 5th decades. It presents as symmetrical polyarthritis of the proximal finger joints,
tenosynovitis, early morning stiffness and pain. Histopathological features include synovial cell hyperplasia and proliferation with inflammatory infiltrates and rheumatoid nodules. These are  necrotising granulomas surrounded by fibrinoid necrosis.
The below image shows rheumatoid nodules:


option D: Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection with skin lesions and flu-like symptoms. It  presents with asymmetric inflammatory polyarthritis of the large joints when left untreated.",5381-3417.PNG,A,5393-3430.PNG;5393-3429.PNG
Q5,which of the following is false regarding hip dislocation?,"a)Nerve injury more common in anterior
b)posterior dislocation is more common than anterior","statement C is false. Nerve injury is more common in posterior hip dislocation. The sciatic nerve, lying behind the posterior wall of the acetabulum is most commonly involved here.
sciatic nerve injury is seen in 1o-2o % of cases with posterior hip dislocation. It is usually a     neuropraxia type of injury and resolves spontaneously. But, if it is suspected after a reduction maneuver, immediate exploration must be carried out.
posterior hip dislocation is the commonest type of hip dislocation (8o%), commonly seen
following dashboard injuries. The patient presents with flexion, adduction, and internal rotation deformities.
X-ray findings include:
• Femoral head lying above and behind the acetabulum and appears smaller than normal
• Lesser trochanter is not visualized as the thigh is internally rotated
• Femoral head and posterior acetabular wall fractures may also be seen
Treatment includes an early reduction to reduce the risk of osteonecrosis and
osteoarthritis. Closed reduction under sedation or general anaesthesia is done in most cases. If there is an associated femoral neck fracture, the closed reduction should not be attempted as it can lead to the displacement of the femoral neck and disrupt the blood supply to the femoral     head.
Anterior hip dislocation is less common than posterior hip dislocations and accounts for about   1o-2o% of all hip dislocations. This injury is usually sustained following a high-energy accident. The affected limb in this condition will be abducted, externally rotated, and slightly flexed.
Note: Although vascular injuries are seen in posterior dislocations as well, they are most likely with anterior dislocation. This is because of the femoral artery lying anterior to the head.

Q6,A 35-year-old man presented with knee pain. The x-ray of his knee joint is given below. what is the probable diagnosis?,"a)chondroblastoma
b)osteochondroma
c)osteoclastoma
d)Fibrous dysplasia","The given clinical scenario and the x-ray showing a lytic lesion at the end of a long bone with a soap-bubble appearance suggest a giant cell tumor (GCT)/ osteoclastoma.
osteoclastoma is a benign but locally aggressive tumor that usually affects young adults of age 2o to 4o years with slight female predominance. It affects the ends of long bones, involving
metaphysis/epiphysis of long bones. GCT is most commonly seen in the distal femur, proximal
tibia, proximal humerus, and distal radius. Common presenting complaints are swelling and
vague pain. sometimes, the patient presents for the first time with a pathological fracture through the lesion.
Important X-ray features of a GCT:
• A solitary, possibly loculated, lytic lesion in the epiphysis.
• Eccentric location, most often subchondral.
• Expansion of the overlying cortex.
• soap bubble appearance - The tumor is homogeneously lytic with trabeculae of the remnants of bone traversing it, giving it a loculated appearance called soap bubble appearance.
• No calcification within the tumor.
• No or minimal reactive sclerosis around the tumor.
Histologically, GCTs consist of undifferentiated spindle cells profusely interspersed
with multi-nucleated giant cells. The tumor stroma is well-vascularized with bands of cellular or collagenous fibrous tissue.
The image below shows the histopathology of osteoclastoma:


The treatment of choice for GCT is extended curettage and bone grafting.
• GCT in the relatively insignificant bone like the distal ulna, clavicle, and proximal fibula is treated by resection without reconstruction.
• Bisphosphonates have been shown to reduce the proliferation of osteoclasts and hence have been shown to stabilize local and metastatic disease.



• Radiation can be used for spinal or sacral tumors.
other options:
option A: chondroblastoma is a benign tumor that usually appears as well-circumscribed round    or oval lytic lesions in the center of the epiphysis of a long bone. It presents as a painful mass that causes effusion or stiffness. It is most commonly seen in ages 1o-2o years.
The following is an x-ray image of the knee showing chondroblastoma:


option B: osteochondromas are common benign bone tumors commonly present in adolescents. The lesions consist of a bony mass, often in the form of a stalk, produced by endochondral
ossification of a growing cartilaginous cap. They are usually painless. The common sites of involvement are the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus.
The following is an x-ray image of the knee showing osteochondroma of the distal knee:




option D: Fibrous dysplasia is a condition that affects bone development and is characterized by the replacement of the bone with fibrous tissue. The patient presents with a progressive limb
deformity or a fracture through a previously asymptomatic lesion which often occurs in the
second decade. other symptoms include nonspecific bone pain, tenderness, and swelling in the affected area. The commonly involved sites are the proximal femur, tibia, pelvis, and foot.
polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is associated with Mccune-Albright syndrome.
Radiological findings include:
• well-defined, expansile intramedullary lesions
• Hazy ground glass appearance is seen in the majority of cases
• shepherd's crook deformity - Expansion with marked varus in the proximal femur

Q7,Book test is used to assess the function of adductor pollicis. which of the following nerves supplies this muscle?,"a)posterior interosseous nerve
b)ulnar nerve
c)Radial nerve
d)Median nerve","The deep terminal branch of the ulnar nerve supplies the adductor pollicis muscle.
A positive book test or Froment's sign indicates weakness of the adductor pollicis muscle, due to ulnar nerve weakness.
In this test, the patient is asked to hold a book between the thumb and index finger against
resistance, and the sign is positive if there is flexion at the interphalangeal joint. This is because if the weakness of adductor pollicis is present, thumb adduction is weak; the flexor pollicis
longus muscle compensates for this weakness by inducing flexion of the interphalangeal joint.
Adduction paralysis occurs as a result of low lesions of the ulnar nerve, which are commonly
caused by cuts on shattered glass. The patient has numbness in the medial one-and-a-half fingers. The hand assumes the claw-hand deformity, with hyperextension of the metacarpophalangeal
joints of the ring and little fingers, due to weakness of the intrinsic muscles. Hypothenar and interosseous wasting may be seen in the affected hand when compared to the normal hand.
The image below shows the test being demonstrated:",,B,5398-3435.PNG
Q8,A 6-year-old girl sustained a fracture of the lateral condyle of the humerus which led to the     development of elbow deformity. which of the following findings can be seen in this patient?,"a)Ape thumb deformity
b)pointing index sign
c)Inability to adduct the fingers
d)kiloh-Nevin sign","The finding that can be seen in this patient with a fracture of the lateral condyle of the humerus is the inability to adduct the fingers. This is due to tardy ulnar nerve palsy.
In this condition, there is stretching of the ulnar nerve due to cubitus valgus deformity that occurs as a result of long-standing non-union of a fractured lateral condyle of the humerus.
The normal carrying angle of the elbow is 13 degrees. A cubitus valgus deformity is an angle more than this or an asymmetry between the two sides.
The image below shows cubitus valgus deformity.





The ulnar nerve is most commonly injured in flexion type of supracondylar fracture. In ulnar nerve injury at the wrist, there
is hyperextension at metacarpophalangeal joints and flexion at interphalangeal joints. This   causes claw hand deformity. There is numbness in the medial one-third of the palm and the medial one-and-a-half fingers.
The patient is unable to abduct the fingers due to paralysis of the dorsal interossei. The loss of adduction is due to paralysis of the palmar interossei muscles.
A card test is done to test the function of palmar interossei muscles.


other options:
option A: Ape thumb deformity is characterized by the inability to abduct the thumb due to
paralysis of the thenar muscles supplied by the median nerve. The thumb remains in the same plane as the wrist.



option B: In median nerve injury of the forearm or elbow, there is paralysis of long flexors of the digits. This leads to the characteristic pointing index finger.
option C: The inability to perform the 'ok' sign is called as kiloh Nevin sign. It is seen in the involvement of the anterior interosseous nerve. The patient is unable to bend the terminal
phalanx of the thumb and index finger joints due to weakness of the flexor pollicis longus and lateral half flexor digitorum profundus.",,C,5399-3437.PNG;5399-3436.PNG
Q9,"A 65-year-old postmenopausal female patient comes with persistent backache not responding to conservative treatment. she has a history of lifting heavy weights 4 months back and
progressively increasing pain that worsens on walking. The pain starts radiating down her legs after walking for a distance of around 1oo m. However, she feels no pain on walking   uphill. what is the most probable diagnosis?","a)osteoporotic compression fracture
b)Lumbar stenosis
c)Thromboangiitis obliterans
d)Atherosclerosis","The given clinical scenario of an old woman with back pain that worsens on walking and relieves walking uphill points to the diagnosis of lumbar stenosis.
walking uphill may be preferred as it flexes the spine and maximizes the spinal canal
capacity, relieving the pain.
spinal stenosis is the narrowing of the spinal canal, causing nerve compression. It can be
congenital or acquired, with degeneration being the most common cause. other factors include conditions like spondylolysis, trauma, infection, and metabolic disorders.
Degenerative spinal stenosis involves disc degeneration, facet joint hypertrophy, and ligamentum flavum calcification. These changes lead to reduced spinal canal dimensions and compression of   the nerves resulting in neurogenic claudication.
They present with symptoms such as back pain (most common), sciatica, sensory disturbances in the legs, motor weakness, and sometimes urinary disturbances. pain typically occurs after
standing or walking for a few minutes and is relieved by sitting, squatting, or flexing the spine.
MRI is the imaging method of choice for the investigation of spinal stenosis. Conservative
treatment is the first line for spinal stenosis, including reassurance, pain relief, exercise, and activity modification.
surgery is considered if conservative measures fail and there is significant functional impairment   and severe neurological symptoms. posterior decompression is the surgical method. Laminectomy is performed for central stenosis.",,B,
Q10,Disruption of the axon with an intact endoneurium is seen in which of the following?,"a)Neurapraxia
b)Axonapraxia
c)Axonotmesis
d)Neurotmesis","Disruption of the axon with an intact endoneurium is seen in axonotmesis. There is an axonal disruption (inner axon is damaged) and loss of conductivity, with an intact outer sheath.
Axonotmesis (axonal interruption): There is a loss of conduction, but the continuity of the nerve is maintained and the neural tubes are intact. There is disruption of the axon i.e., the continuity of    the axon is broken. But the endoneurium and perineurium are intact, maintaining the continuity   of the nerve. It occurs following trauma such as closed fractures and dislocations.
Distal to the lesion, wallerian degeneration of the disrupted axon occurs, where axons
disintegrate and are resorbed by phagocytes. It is then followed by axonal regeneration where numerous fine unmyelinated fibres grow from the proximal stumps to the endoneurial tubes.



other options:
option A- Neurapraxia is the reversible physiological nerve conduction block causing some loss of sensation and muscle power. There is spontaneous recovery after a few days or weeks. It occurs
following prolonged compression, as in saturday night palsy, and crutch palsy. Here, there
is segmental demyelination but the axon is intact. Nerve conduction is slowed because of the loss of myelin. It is followed by the regeneration of the myelin.
option B- Neurotmesis is the complete transection of the nerve trunk. It is usually associated with open wounds. The endoneurial tubes are destroyed and the scar tissue prevents the regenerating    axons from entering the distal segment. The regenerating fibers mingle with proliferating
schwann cells and fibroblasts to form a neuroma at the site of injury.
option D- Axonapraxia is a disruption to the axoplasmic flow of neurochemicals temporarily.",,C,
Q11,A patient presents to the OPD with Trendelenburg sign positive on one side. which of the following muscles are involved?,"a)2 only
b)1,3
c)2,4
d)1,4","The muscles involved in a positive Trendelenburg sign are the hip abductors—the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus.
The gluteus medius and minimus are powerful abductors of the hip supplied by the superior
gluteal nerve. stabilizing the pelvis on the femur during walking is done by these muscles. It is     demonstrated by asking the subject to stand on one limb. If the ipsilateral abductors are normal, the pelvis remains in a horizontal position. If the ipsilateral abductors are weak, then the pelvis   tilts towards the opposite (unsupported) side. This is called positive Trendelenburg’s sign.
other causes of positive Trendelenburg signs include shortening of the femoral neck, abductor tendon rupture, and dislocation or subluxation of the hip joint.
patients are known to have a characteristic gait, which is called Trendelenburg or waddling    gait. The trunk is thrown from side to side with each step, and the patient lurches toward the affected limb while walking.
The image below depicts Trendelenburg's gait.",,A,5399-3437-2.png
Q12,"You visit a newborn near your house and notice that the baby has CTEV, as shown below. when would you advise the baby's parents for a consultation to put on a cast?","a)In 1 month
b)In 6 months
c)In a few days
d)when the child starts walking","Treatment of CTEV (congenital talipes equinovarus) should begin as early as the first 2
weeks after birth. In CTEV, or idiopathic clubfoot, the deformity is equinus, inversion, forefoot adduction, and cavus.
ponseti's method is a successful method of manipulation in CTEV. The order of correction
according to ponseti's method is cavus-adduction-varus-equinus (CAVE). weekly manipulation of the foot is done with the help of plaster casts.
The first metatarsal is elevated initially to correct the cavus. This creates a flat longitudinal medial border of the foot. Then, the forefoot is abducted in the plane of the metatarsals. This everts the     hindfoot and corrects the forefoot out of supination. Finally, the equinus is corrected
by dorsiflexing the foot at the ankle joint. In most cases, a percutaneous Achilles' tenotomy is required later for complete correction of the equinus deformity.
After correction, a foot abduction brace (FAB) is used to maintain the corrected position, initially full-time (for 3 months) and then night-time and nap-time for 4 years to prevent relapse of the
deformity. CTEV shoes are worn during the day once the child starts walking for up to 5 years.
They have a straight inner border (prevents adduction), outer shoe raise (prevents foot inversion), and no heel to prevent equinus.

b)Equinus, inversion, forefoot adduction, cavus
c)Equinus, eversion, forefoot abduction, cavus
d)Equinus, inversion, forefoot adduction, planus","In congenital talipes equinovarus (cTEV), or idiopathic clubfoot, the deformity is equinus,     inversion, forefoot adduction, and cavus. cTEV is a congenital malformation of the foot. It is predominately seen in male children. calf and medial foot tissues are underdeveloped.
components of deformity:
• cavus - This deformity occurs due to exaggerated arching of the foot at the mid-tarsal joint.
• Adduction - This deformity occurs at the talonavicular joint.
• Inversion - This deformity occurs at the subtalar joint. The calcaneum is inverted, and along with it, the whole foot is inverted. This leads to a medially facing sole.
• Equinus - This deformity occurs at the ankle joint and tarsal joints.
Equinovarus deformity causes inward twisting of the foot (shown below), with the sole facing   posteromedially in severe cases. Associated disorders like congenital hip dislocation and spina bifida should be evaluated.





Ponseti's method is a successful method of manipulation in CTEV. It should begin as early as the first 2 weeks after birth. weekly manipulation of the foot is done with the help of plaster

Q14,"A child presents with poor growth and swelling at joints. A radiograph of his wrist is given below. Lab investigations reveal serum ALP levels of &gt;15oo. what is the possible
diagnosis?","a)scurvy
b)Rickets
c)osteogenesis imperfecta
d)Paget's disease","The clinical vignette describing a child with poor growth, the wrist radiograph findings showing cupping and fraying, and the raised ALP levels are suggestive of rickets.
Inadequate mineralization of bone in children is known as rickets. There is inadequate
calcification of the growth plate, leading to irregular chondrocyte accumulation, widened growth plate, poor mineralization in the zone of calcification, and sparse bone formation.
Vitamin D disorders, such as vitamin D deficiency or resistance, calcium deficiency, phosphorus deficiency, and renal loss are among the common causes of rickets. Decreased vitamin D levels
reduce calcium and phosphate absorption, leading to low blood calcium. This stimulates increased production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and elevates alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels involved in bone mineralization.



Infants with rickets may exhibit symptoms such as tetany, convulsions, failure to thrive,
listlessness, and muscle weakness. softening of the skull bones called craniotabes is seen. Delayed closure of fontanels, frontal bossing, and delayed dentition are also seen.
widening of the costochondral junctions, forming a rachitic rosary along the ribs is seen in the chest. Harrison groove, a horizontal depression along the lower chest, can occur due to rib
softening. vertebral column abnormalities like scoliosis, kyphosis, and lordosis can also
appear. In the distal extremities widening of the wrists and ankles, varus/ valgus deformities,
windswept deformity (valgus on the side and varus on the contralateral side), and anterior tibial bowing are seen.


The laboratory findings on vitamin D deficiency rickets would be normal/decreased serum
calcium, decreased phosphorous, elevated PTH, and increased ALP levels. Thickening and
widening of the growth plate, cupping of the metaphysis, and potential bowing of the diaphysis are seen on X-ray.
Children with nutritional vitamin D deficiency should receive vitamin D supplementation and
ensure adequate intake of calcium and phosphorus. Two strategies for vitamin D administration  are stoss therapy (3oo,ooo-6oo,ooo IU over 1 day) and daily supplementation (2,ooo IU/day for at least 3 months).
other options:
option A: scurvy is caused by vitamin C deficiency, resulting in bleeding tendencies and various  manifestations such as petechiae, gum bleeding, and scorbutic rosary. Radiographically, it shows characteristic findings like the white line of Frankel, Pelkan spurs, and periosteal elevation.
option C: osteogenesis imperfecta (Brittle bone disease) is caused by deficiencies in the synthesis  of type I collagen. It presents with the hallmark features of osteoporosis with increased fragility of bones along with blue sclera, dental fragility as well as hearing loss.
option D: Paget's disease of the bone is a condition where there is an increased bone turnover
followed by enlargement and thickening of the bone. In this condition, calcium levels are normal with raised ALP.",5385-3421.PNG,B,5405-3441.PNG
Q15,what is not required on an emergency basis in an open fracture?,"a)1, 2, 3
b)2 only
c)2 and 4
d)2 and 3","Emergency management of open fractures is mainly focused on the prevention of infection by
providing antibiotic coverage and splinting (statements 3 and 4). Reduction of the fracture
(statement 1) can be done in the emergency room. Internal fixation is not done on an emergency basis for an open fracture due to the risk of infection (statement 2). It is a part of definitive
management and is done after the patient is stabilized.
open fractures are characterized by a break in the overlying skin and soft tissues. Hence, the
fracture fragment is exposed to the external environment. There are more prone to be infected.
The major components of the management of open fractures:
• Antibiotic prophylaxis - It should be given as early as possible (within 3 hours of injury). Amoxiclav is commonly used.
• Early debridement of the wound and fracture - This includes the following steps:
• Excision of the wound margins
• Extension of the wound if required
• Delivery of the fracture outside the wound for proper examination
• Removal of the devitalized tissue
• cleansing of the wound to remove all the foreign materials
• Nerves and tendons are usually left alone, but if the wound is clean, a repair can be considered
• wound cover:
• In Gustilo Type I and II fractures, wound cover can be done at the time of debridement (early wound cover)
• Delayed wound cover is usually practiced in Type III fractures
• Fracture stabilization: External fixators are used to stabilize the fractures in the emergency room. Definitive management is later done by open reduction and internal fixation (oRIF).",,B,

d)2, 4","The given x-ray showing a lytic lesion at the end of a long bone is suggestive of a giant cell
tumor (GCT)/osteoclastoma. It affects the ends of long bones, involving metaphysis/epiphysis
(statement 3). GCT is most commonly seen in the distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal humerus, and distal radius.
GCTs usually affect young adults of age 2o to 4o years (statement 1), with slight female
predominance. It is a benign but locally aggressive tumor. They present with swelling, vague pain, or pathological fracture through the lesion.
A solitary eccentric, expansile, lobulated lytic lesion in the epiphysis/metaphysis is seen on a plain X-ray, which is diagnostic (statement 2). The tumor is homogeneously lytic with trabeculae of
the remnants of bone traversing it, giving it a loculated appearance called a soap bubble



appearance (shown below). soft-tissue extension with a mass can also be observed. They usually lack calcification, new bone formation, or periosteal reaction.


Histologically, GCTs display a mixture of meaty, reddish-purple tissue with soft yellow areas. They are characterized by numerous osteoclast-like giant cells dispersed among round or
spindle-shaped mononuclear cells (shown below). The tumor stroma is well-vascularized with bands of cellular or collagenous fibrous tissue.


Malignancy transformation is rare (&lt;1%) in GCTs, though possible (statement 4).
The treatment of choice for GCT is extended curettage and bone grafting. GCT in the relatively
insignificant bone like the distal ulna, clavicle, and proximal fibula is treated by resection without reconstruction. Bisphosphonates have been shown to reduce the proliferation of osteoclasts and    hence have been shown to stabilize local and metastatic disease. Radiation can be used
for spinal or sacral tumors.



Denosumab is an anti-RANKL antibody that can be used to stop the osteolytic process. It can be used in advanced stage 3 lesions or lesions in inoperable locations.
