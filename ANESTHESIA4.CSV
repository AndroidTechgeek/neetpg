Q1,A patient of blunt chest trauma has been started on mechanical ventilation. Which of the following is not correct about the initial setting?,"a)Respiratory rate - 12 Breaths/ min
b)PEEP - 5cm H2o
c)Fio2- 1oo%
d)Tidal volume - 12ml/kg of actual BW","The tidal volume of 12ml/kg of actual body weight is an incorrect initial setting for mechanical ventilation.
Initial ventilatory settings are as given below:
• Tidal volume - 4-6 ml/kg of IBW (Ideal Body Weight)
• Respiratory rate - 12 Breaths/ min
• Fio2 - 1oo% to begin with and titrated to lesser values to prevent oxygen toxicity
• PEEP - Begin with 5 cm H2o, titrate to 1o cm H2o (carefully increased as high PEEP may impair ventricular filling in a patient with blunt chest trauma)",,D,
Q2,Glycopyrrolate is used as a pre-anesthetic agent for:,"a)Reducing the secretions
b)sedative effect
c)skeletal muscle relaxant
d)Anxiolytic","Glycopyrrolate is used as a pre-anesthetic agent for reducing the secretions.
Anticholinergic drugs e.g. atropine, glycopyrrolate are routinely administered with
anticholinesterases in order to attenuate the undesirable muscarinic effects. Glycopyrrolate is
usually preferred because it has less vagolytic effects than atropine at doses that inhibit secretions and does not cross the blood-brain barrier. It should be administered as early as possible to
maximize its effectiveness.
Glycopyrrolate o.2 mg IV, is administered to dry airway secretions before flexible scope
intubation of the trachea, during the bronchoscopic examination.",,A,
Q3,cardiac output can be determined using the following except?,"a)Thermal dilution technique
b)capnography
c)Esophageal doppler
d)Echocardiography","Capnography is a measurement of end-tidal Co2, which is used to confirm tracheal intubation and assess ventilation in the perioperative period.
Cardiac output measurements technique:
• Thermodilution
• Dye dilution, using indocyanine green
• Lithium dilution
• Pulse contour devices
• Esophageal doppler
• Thoracic bioimpedance
• Echocardiography
Note: Thermal dilution method uses a non-toxic liquid of temperature different from the blood. This fluid is injected into a vein and is detected on the arterial side using a catheter with a
temperature sensor. The rate of flow of this liquid is used to calculate the cardiac output.",,B,
Q4,Identify the equipment shown in the image below.,"a)Mechanical ventilator
b)Infusion pump
c)CPAP machine
d)High flow nasal cannula","The equipment shown in the image is high flow nasal cannula.
High flow nasal cannula is a mode of respiratory support used in the management of acute respiratory failure. It delivers humidified gas via the nasal cannula at high flow rates.
• HFNC can deliver oxygen at 4oL/min, 37°C, and 99.9% relative humidity.
• The high-flow oxygen is delivered directly to the nasopharynx. This produces Fio2 equal to that delivered by traditional mask devices.
• The benefits of HFNC include reduced work of breathing, improved gas exchange by
nasopharyngeal dead-space washout, and decreased energy required to humidify and heat respiratory gases.
The HFNC equipment shown in the image below uses a heated humidifier (named PMH2oo), a nasal cannula (no. 2), and a ventilator (brand: vivo3o).





other options:
option a: Mechanical ventilator


option b: Infusion pump





option c: CPAP",3422-2140.PNG,D,3426-2143.PNG;3426-2142.PNG;3427-2145.PNG;3427-2144.PNG
Q5,The blue pipeline in the operation theatre is used for delivering which of the following gases?,"a)oxygen
b)Nitrous oxide
c)Air
d)vacuum","The blue pipeline in operation theatre is for nitrous oxide. other options:
oxygen: white
Air: Black
vacuum/Central suction: yellow",,B,
Q6,The given set of instruments are used in:,"a)Central line insertion
b)Arterial line insertion
c)Airway management
d)umbilical catheter insertion","The image shows a tray in an airway cart with the instruments necessary for airway management. An airway cart may include:
• Laryngoscope blades of various sizes, including a rigid fibreoptic.
• Tracheal tubes of various sizes, and tracheal tube guides such as semirigid stylets, ventilating  tube changer, light wands, and forceps that are required to manipulate the distal portion of the tracheal tube.
• Masks of various sizes.
• Laryngeal mask airways of various sizes.
• Flexible fiberoptic intubation equipment.
• Retrograde intubation equipment.
• At least one device to perform emergency noninvasive airway ventilation such as esophageal tracheal tube, a hollow jet ventilation stylet.
• Equipment required for emergency invasive airway access.
• An exhaled Co2 detector.",3423-2141.PNG,C,
Q7,"on your morning walk in the park, you notice an unconscious man lying on the ground. which of the following options would be the next best step?","a)Check carotid pulse, start CPR, and call for help; Defibrillate if no pulse.
b)Call for help, check pulse, do CPR, defibrillate if no pulse
c)observe
d)Ignore and continue to walk","The next best step is to Call for help, check pulse, do CPR, defibrillate If no pulse.
steps in basic life support:
First step – Assess safety of the surroundings.
second step - Assess for responsiveness
Third step – Proceed if the patient is unresponsive. shout for help.
If the patient is unresponsive, assess for breathing and carotid pulse simultaneously for no more than 1o seconds.
In the given scenario, it is already mentioned that you are in a park (scene safety has been assessed), and that the person is unconscious (responsiveness has been assessed). so, the   immediate next step is to call for help, and start CPR.",,B,
Q8,which of the following can be considered as effective CPR?,"a)1, 2, 3, and 4
b)1, 2, and 4
c)2, 3, and 4
d)1 and 2 only","The ideal rescue breath rate for adults is 1o breaths/min, while in infants and children up to puberty it is 2o-3o breaths/min. As the person's age group is not specified in the question,    assuming an adult, statement 1 is incorrect, while 2, 3, and 4 are correct.
Effective chest compression in adults:
• Provide 1oo-12o compressions per minute (3o compressions for every 15-18 sec).



• place your arms, one over the other in the midline, on the lower 1/3rd of the patient's sternum, and lock your arms.
• use both arms to press the chest to a depth of 5-6 cm (2 - 2.4 inches) or more.
• press hard and fast
• Allow for full chest recoil after every compression.
Effective chest compressions in a child older than 1 year and up to puberty:
• The compression rate is 1oo - 12o/min   (3o compressions for every 15-18 sec).
• one or both palms are placed in the midline.
• The depth of compression is 2 inches.
• press hard and fast
• Allow for full chest recoil after every compression.
Effective chest compressions in infants (&lt;1 year):
• 1oo to 12o compressions per minute (3o compressions for every 15-18 sec).
• one provider: place two fingers, one between the nipple line and the other 1 cm below.
• Two providers: Encircle the infant's torso with both hands with both thumbs pointing cephalic positioned 1cm below the nipples over the sternum.
• Depth of compressions should be at least 1.5 inches or 1/3 the depth of the infant’s chest.
• press hard and fast
• Allow for full chest recoil after every compression.",,C,
