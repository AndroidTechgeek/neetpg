Q1,"A 3o-year-old female presents with redness and pain in the eye. Examination revealed an IOP of 38 mm of Hg, aqueous flare, and corneal precipitates. which of the following drugs must     be avoided in her?","a)Beta blockers
b)Mannitol
c)carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
d)Prostaglandin analogs","The given clinical vignette is suggestive of anterior uveitis with a raised intraocular pressure.
Among the given options, latanoprost is the least suited for use in this patient as it can result in worsening of the anterior uveitis.
Latanoprost is a PGF 2 alpha analog that acts by increasing the uveoscleral outflow and
thereby lowers the intraocular pressure. Latanoprost is a prodrug and gets activated during its passage through the cornea. It acts by stimulating the prostanoid receptors on the ciliary
muscles. This leads to the release of matrix metalloproteinases, which act to increases the
uveoscleral outflow. It should be used with caution in those with uveitis, iritis, cystoid macular edema, and herpes simplex keratitis.
Topical prostaglandins like latanoprost, travoprost, bimatoprost, and tafluprost are now used as    first-line agents to lower IOP.  The most common ocular side effects are conjunctival hyperemia,   eyelash thickening, iris hyperpigmentation, and loss of periorbital fat (bimatoprost). The systemic side effects are uncommon and include occasional headache, malaise, myalgia, skin rash, and
mild upper respiratory infections.",,D,
Q2,Identify the condition:,"a)Medial rectus palsy
b)Trochlear nerve palsy
c)Abducens nerve palsy
d)Oculomotor nerve palsy","The image is suggestive of oculomotor nerve palsy.
Isolated 3rd nerve palsy
causes
• Microvascular disease such as hypertension and diabetes is the most common cause of third nerve palsy.
• Aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery
• Episodic cases of isolated palsy may be seen due to migraine, compression, ischemia, and alterations in intracranial pressure
• Trauma
• Inflammatory diseases such as syphilis, Lyme disease, sarcoidosis; giant cell arteritis
• vasculitis
The signs of left oculomotor nerve palsy are summarized in the image attached below.",3039-1850.PNG,D,3046-1856.PNG
Q3,Identify the site of the lesion.,"a)Left occipital lobe
b)Right occipital lobe
c)Left geniculate body
d)optic chiasma","The visual field defect shows right homonymous hemianopia with macular-sparing, which is caused by lesions of the left occipital lobe (contralateral/crossing of fibers).
such lesions are generally due to the occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery. These are
commonly seen in head injury and may be associated with visual hallucinations, denial of
blindness (Anton syndrome), and the Riddoch phenomenon (only moving visual targets are
perceived). These lesions generally spare the central vision/macular vision. The anatomical reason  for this sparing is attributed to the uniqueness in the blood supply. while the part of the occipital   lobe representing the peripheral field vision is supplied by the posterior cerebral artery, the area     at the tip of the calcarine cortex, representing the central macular vision is supplied by a branch of the middle cerebral artery.",3040-1851.PNG,A,
Q4,what is the most common route of the spread of retinoblastoma?,"a)optic nerve invasion
b)Hematogenous
c)Direct invasion
d)Lymphatic spread","Direct invasion is the most common mode of spread of retinoblastoma.
Retinoblastoma arises from the neurosensory retina. It is a proliferation of neural cells that have   failed to evolve normally. Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in children.  Tumours are composed of small basophilic cells (retinoblasts), with large
hyperchromatic nuclei and scanty cytoplasm.
It is of 4 types:
• Endophytic (into the vitreous)with seeding of tumor cells throughout the eye
• Exophytic (into the subretinal space) leading to retinal detachment
• Mixed type
• Retinocytoma: retina may be diffusely infiltrated",,C,
Q5,The most common tumor of the lacrimal gland is?,"a)Adenoid cystic carcinoma
b)Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
c)pleomorphic adenoma
d)Mucoepidermoid carcinoma",pleomorphic adenoma is the most common tumor of the lacrimal gland while adenoid cystic carcinoma is the most common carcinoma of the lacrimal gland.,,C,
Q6,SAFE strategy for trachoma includes all except?,"a)Surgery for trichiasis
b)Antibiotics
c)Facial cleanliness
d)Evaluation of control program",E in the SAFE strategy stands for Environmental improvement with better hygiene and sanitation.,,D,
Q7,Identify the surgical step shown in the image given below.,"a)Capsulorrhexis
b)Hydrodissection
c)Intraocular lens implantation
d)Lens aspiration","capsulorrhexis is the step shown in the given image.
capsulorrhexis is a method of anterior capsulotomy, where an opening is made in the anterior
capsule of the lens. It is one of the steps involved in conventional extracapsular cataract extraction (EccE).
Anterior capsulotomy can be done by one of three methods - can opener's technique, linear capsulotomy or envelope technique, or continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis.
continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis (ccc), is considered to be superior to all the preexisting   methods because when done correctly, it does not leave any edges or tears. Trypan blue dye can be used to stain the lens capsule for better visibility.
In EccE, a portion of the anterior capsule of the lens is removed, allowing extraction of the lens   nucleus and cortex. This leaves the remainder of the anterior capsule, the posterior capsule, and   the zonular support intact. The intact lens nucleus is then removed from the eye through a limbal incision.
An anterior capsulotomy is followed by hydro dissection using a balanced salt solution. This helps to separate the corticonuclear mass from the capsule. Removal of lens nucleus and aspiration of    the cortex is done using a two-way irrigation and aspiration cannula. An intraocular lens (IOL) is   then implanted and the incision is then closed.
Some ofthe IOLs used are shown in the image below.",3041-1852.PNG,A,3048-1857.PNG
Q8,The most common ocular manifestation of COVID-19 is:,"a)Retinal vein thrombosis
b)Viral keratouveitis
c)Follicular conjunctivitis
d)pseudomembranous conjunctivitis","The most common ocular manifestation of COVID-19 is follicular conjunctivitis.
It has been observed that SARS-CoV-2 needs the ACE-2 receptors for cell invasion. The ACE-2   receptors are found not only in human type 2 alveolar epithelial cells but also in the cornea and conjunctiva. This suggests that ocular surface tissue may be a potential target tissue for
SARS-CoV-2.
The ocular manifestations of COVID-19 vary greatly. The most prevalent ocular symptoms were dry eye or foreign body sensation, redness, tearing, itching, eye pain, and discharge.
The most common ocular complication of COVID-19 is mild follicular conjunctivitis. Hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, dry eye disease, episcleritis, chemosis, and photophobia can also occur, but less
frequently. Intraocular complications include retinal artery occlusions, hemorrhages, and cotton wool spots caused by complement-mediated thrombotic angiopathy.
Sometimes, conjunctivitis may appear as the only sign and symptom of COVID-19. Patients should therefore undergo a nasopharyngeal RT-PCR test.
All physicians and ophthalmologists should be cautious when addressing a patient with
conjunctivitis and should wear eye-protective gear in addition to face masks and other protective devices during clinical examination of these patients.",,C,
Q9,A patient who is a known case of angle-closure glaucoma has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder. which of the following drugs have to be avoided in this patient?,"a)Amitriptyline
b)sertraline
c)Mirtazapine
d)Fluvoxamine","Amitriptyline is the drug to be avoided in patients having angle-closure glaucoma with major depressive disorder.
In angle-closure glaucoma, there is apposition of peripheral iris against the trabecular meshwork resulting in obstruction of aqueous outflow by the closure of an already narrow-angle of the



anterior chamber, with an increase in the intraocular pressure being the aftermath.
Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that also has a marked anticholinergic activity due to a high affinity for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and the subsequent blockade of the
receptors. These muscarinic cholinoceptors, specifically M3 type, upon stimulation, are
responsible for contraction of the iris sphincter, ciliary muscle and trabecular meshwork as well as the increased outflow of aqueous humour. Therefore, blocking of these receptors would result in
the decreased outflow of aqueous humour, which ultimately leads to an increase in intraocular pressure.
Therefore, amitriptyline when administered in a patient with pre-existing angle-closure type glaucoma can exacerbate the disorder by further impeding the drainage of aqueous humour.
other options:
options B and D: sertraline and Fluvoxamine are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with no activity at the muscarinic cholinergic receptors and therefore have no effect on the outflow of
aqueous humour and thereby, on the intraocular pressure.
option C: Mirtazapine is an atypical antidepressant that is a serotonin-norephedrine reuptake
inhibitor with the ability to precipitate angle-closure glaucoma by itself; however, due to lack of  any activity at the muscarinic cholinergic receptors, it does not increase the intraocular pressure to the extent that Amitryptaline does.",,A,
Q10,A patient is not able to see the lateral fields. He was having a mild headache for a few weeks    and now presented to the clinic. visual field examination shows the following finding. what is the probable site of the lesion based on the image displayed?,"a)optic chiasma
b)occipital lobe
c)optic tract
d)optic radiation","The visual field defect in the image is indicative ofbitemporal hemianopia, so the probable site of the lesion is the optic chiasma.
Hemianopia or hemianopsia refers to loss of sight in half the visual field. Bitemporal hemianopia refers to loss of sight in the temporal halves of the visual field, seen in lesions affecting the optic   chiasma. The most common cause of this is pituitary gland tumours. other causes
include suprasellar aneurysms, chronic arachnoiditis, suprasellar tumours like
craniopharyngioma and suprasellar meningioma.
Damage to the middle part of the optic chiasm affects fibres crossing at the nasal retina of each
eye, leaving the uncrossed fibres from the temporal retinas intact. The resulting loss of vision is
confined to the temporal visual field of each eye and this is known as bitemporal hemianopia. It is also called heteronymous hemianopia to emphasize the fact that the parts of the visual field that    are lost in each eye do not overlap.
Individuals with this condition are able to see in both left and right central visual fields, with both eyes open. However, all information from the most peripheral parts of visual fields (which are
seen only by the nasal retinas) is lost.
other options:
Lesions at the occipital lobe, optic tract and optic radiation would all cause homonymous
hemianopia. Here, either the right or left half of the binocular field of vision is lost, due to the loss of the temporal half of one field and the nasal half of the other.",3042-1853.PNG,A,
Q11,Identify the finding marked by the arrow in the below image.,"a)vossius ring
b)weiss ring
c)Fleischer's ring
d)kayser Fleischer ring","The finding given in the image is that of a vossius ring.
vossius ring is a circular ring of faint or stippled opacity, seen on the anterior surface of the lens due to brown amorphous granules of pigment lying on the capsule ofthe lens. It is usually seen   after blunt trauma to the eye and orbit.
It usually has about the same diameter as the contracted pupil. The force of the blow drives the
cornea and iris backward and thus producing an impression of the iris on the lens. The resorption of the pigment results in discrete subcapsular opacities.
other options:
option B: weiss ring is a floater which may be seen by the patient as a circle or other large solitary lesion. It is the detached former attachment to the margin of the optic disc. It is seen in posterior   vitreous detachment and is not confirmatory. It is seen in the image below.


option C: A Fleischer's ring is usually observed in keratoconus, representing epithelial iron deposits. It is seen best with a cobalt blue filter.
option D: kayser-Fleischer ring is observed in wilson's disease, due to intraocular deposition of copper. A brownish-yellow zone is seen in the peripheral Descemet membrane of the cornea.
Anterior capsular cataract, also knowns as a sunflower cataract may be seen in some patients.",3043-1855.PNG,A,3050-1858.PNG;3051-1859.PNG
Q12,Identify the chart given in the picture below.,"a)Hess chart
b)snellen chart
c)pelli-Robson chart
d)ETDRs chart","The chart given in the picture is Hess's chart.
Hess chart is used to diagnose and monitor patients with incomitant strabismus by assessing the field of a binocular single vision. In its interpretation, a smaller chart indicates the eye with the    paretic muscle and a larger chart indicates the eye with an overacting muscle.
Incomitant strabismus is one where squint generally results from the limitation of eye movement associated with paralytic or mechanical etiologies like extraocular muscle palsy, thyroid
ophthalmopathy, blow-out fracture, myasthenia gravis, etc. The field of binocular single vision is the area where bifoveal fusion of an object of interest occurs.
other options:
option B: The snellen chart is used to test visual acuity. visual acuity is the eye's ability to discriminate between two points.
A picture of the snellen chart is given below.





option C: The pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity letter chart consists of letters of constant size but decreasing contrast. It is viewed by the patient from a distance of 1 meter until the lowest
resolvable group of three letters on the chart is reached. It is used to measure contrast sensitivity, a measure of the ability to distinguish an object against its background.
An image of the pelli-Robson chart used in the middle east is given below.


option D: The early treatment diabetic retinopathy study or ETDRS chart presents a series of 5
letters of equal difficulty on each row, with standardized spacing between letters and rows. It
consists of a total of 14 lines having 7o letters. It is also used to test visual acuity. An image of the ETDRS chart is given below.",3043-1854.PNG,A,3052-1861.PNG;3052-1860.PNG;3053-1862.PNG
Q13,"A 14-day-old neonate brought to the outpatient department is found to have bilateral
conjunctivitis. chest X-ray done showed lung infiltrates. which of the following organisms is most likely responsible for the infection?","a)chlamydia trachomatis
b)Hemophilus influenzae
c)streptococcus
d)Mycoplasma","chlamydia trachomatis is most likely responsible for the infection.
chlamydia trachomatis inclusion conjunctivitis usually manifests 1 week after birth. It is usually a venereal infection derived from the cervix or urethra of the mother during delivery.
on examination, the conjunctiva is swollen and edematous. The discharge is initially watery, later becomes purulent or bloody.
Newborns with suspected chlamydia infection should have samples drawn from both the
conjunctivae and oropharynx. since it is an obligate intracellular organism, swabs should also
include conjunctival epithelial cells if possible. subsequent Giemsa staining shows characteristic intracellular inclusion bodies formed by chlamydia oculogenitalis.
Treatment involves administration of suspension of erythromycin ethylsuccinate 5o mg/kg daily in four divided doses before feeds for 2–3 weeks.
If left untreated, associated systemic diseases such as chlamydial otitis and pneumonia may
develop later. In all cases, both parents must receive appropriate treatment for genital infection. Neonatal conjunctivitis, also called ophthalmia neonatorum, typically presents during the first     month of life. The age of the neonate is an important clue towards the etiology of the infection.   Neonates are at higher risk of conjunctivitis due to predisposing factors such as:
• Decreased tear production
• Absence of IgA in tears
• Decreased immune function
• Absence of lymphoid tissue in the conjunctiva
• Decreased lysozyme activity.



other risk factors for developing neonatal conjunctivitis are premature rupture of membranes, prolonged delivery, prematurity, poor prenatal care, mechanical ventilation, poor hygiene
conditions, and history of midwife interference.
other options :
option B: Hemophilus influenza is one of the most common causes of acute bacterial
conjunctivitis in children &lt; 6 years of age and is responsible for causing conjunctivitis-otitis syndrome where conjunctivitis is followed by acute otitis media.
option c: streptococcus usually manifests 48-72 hours after birth. It is a common cause of acute bacterial conjunctivitis in children.
option D: Mycoplasma, specifically M.genitalium can cause conjunctivitis due to contamination of the eye with genital infections in adults.
