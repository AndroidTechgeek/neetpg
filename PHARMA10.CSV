1,A female patient on oral contraceptive pills (ocp) was diagnosed to have tuberculosis and started on antitubercular therapy (ATT). she was advised to use an additional barrier method of contraception. what is the reason for this advice?,"a) Teratogenic
b) Failure of ATT
c) Rifampicin decreases ocp metabolism
d) Rifampicin induces ocp metabolism and cause failure","Rifampicin is a potent cytochrome p45o (cyp45o) enzyme inducer. when given along with oral contraceptive pills(ocp) it would induce the metabolism of ocps leading to contraceptive failure. This is the reason for the patient being advised to use an additional method of contraception.
Important enzyme inducers are:
• Barbiturates
• phenytoin
• carbamazepine
• Rifampicin
• cigarette smoking
• chronic alcoholism
Important drugs that inhibit cyp45o isoenzyme are:
• Macrolide antibiotics
• Azole antifungals
• chloramphenicol
• omeprazole
• Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
• HIV protease inhibitors
• cimetidine
• ciprofloxacin
• Metronidazole",,D,,
2,A 35-year-old chronic hypertensive woman visits the outpatient department for pre-conceptional counseling. which of the following anti-hypertensives should she discontinue?,"a) Labetalol
b) calcium channel blockers
c) Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
d) Alpha methyldopa","Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be discontinued in pregnancy as they can cause hypoplasia of organs, growth retardation, and fetal loss.
ACE inhibitors cause reduced perfusion and oligohydramnios leading to fetal growth retardation, calvarium maldevelopment, hypoplasia of lungs and kidneys, and limb contractures.
Antihypertensive drugs to be avoided in pregnancy:
• ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin receptor blockers(ARB) - Can cause growth retardation and fetal damage.
• Diuretics - Can decrease uteroplacental perfusion
• Nonselective beta-blockers
• Sodium nitroprusside - It is contraindicated in eclampsia.
Antihypertensive drugs that can be used in pregnancy:
• Labetalol - Combined a + ß blocker
• Nifedipine - Dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It is useful in preeclampsia but should be stopped before labor as they weaken the uterine contractions.
• Methyldopa
• Hydralazine Note:
Thiazide diuretics like hydrochlorothiazide are considered to be safe in pregnancy and are useful in the management of chronic hypertension in pregnant women.",,C,,
3,A pregnant woman was prescribed indomethacin. which of the following effects does the drug have on the fetus?,"a) premature closure of ductus arteriosus
b) keeps ductus arteriosus patent
c) closure of fossa ovalis
d) premature closure of ductus venosus","Indomethacin can cause premature closure of ductus arteriosus if given to a pregnant woman.
Indomethacin is approved for the closure of persistent ductus arteriosus in premature infants. It is given intravenously. one of its limiting factors is the development of renal toxicity in neonates.
Indomethacin is a nonselective Cox inhibitor. It has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. It can be used in the management of conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, gouty arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, etc. But its use is limited due to the high rate of intolerance and availability of safer agents.
Adverse effects: Diarrhea with ulcerative bowel lesions, acute pancreatitis, and hepatitis are seen. Frontal headache is the most frequent CNS effect. Dizziness, light-headedness, vertigo, and mental confusion can occur. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and rarely aplastic anemia can also occur.
Note:
Prostaglandin analogs are indicated in the maintenance of patency of the ductus arteriosus.",,A,,
4,which of the following can be prescribed in case of an open angle glaucoma with bronchial asthma?,"a) Timolol
b) Gemeprost
c) Latanoprost
d) Mannitol infusion","Latanoprost can be given in a case of open-angle glaucoma with bronchial asthma.
Latanoprost is a PGF2a analog and it is not associated with systemic side effects like bronchospasm and hence can be given for asthmatic patients. Prostaglandin analogs are the first choice drugs for open-angle glaucoma.
Mechanism of action: It reduces intraocular pressure by altering the ciliary muscle tension and improving the outflow of the aqueous humor.
Advantages oflatanoprost:
• Good efficacy
• once-daily application
• Absence of systemic side effects
Disadvantage: High cost
Adverse effects:
• Blurring of vision
• Iris pigmentation
• Thickening and darkening of eyelashes
• Macular edema can occur especially in aphakic patients.
other options:
option A- Timolol is a non-selective beta-blocker used topically in glaucoma. It is associated with systemic effects by absorption through the nasolacrimal duct and can cause life-threatening bronchospasm in asthmatics and CoPD patients. Hence they are not given in in this case.
option B- Gemeprost is a PGE1 analog used for the termination of early pregnancy.
option D- Mannitol infusion is given for acute congestive glaucoma and not for open-angle glaucoma. It causes decongestion of the eye by its osmotic action.",,C,,
5,"As a medical practitioner in India, how will you prescribe alprazolam to a patient?","a) 1 mg OD before bedtime for 7 days
b) 1/2 mg HS for 7 days
c) o.5 mg BD for 7 days
d) o.5 mg daily before bedtime for 7 days","The correct method of prescribing alprazolam is o.5mg daily before bedtime for 7 days.
The drugs are prescribed in generic names legibly and preferably in capital letters. The prescription should have details to identify the patient and medication that needs to be dispensed and the therapeutic purpose. The use of abbreviations, especially Latin is discouraged. The dosage should be written in metric measure.
Guidelines for drug prescription:
The parts of an ideal prescription are as follows.
• Date
• Name and address of the doctor
• superscription(Rx symbol)
• Information about the patient
• Name and dose of the drug prescribed(Inscription)
• Dispencing directions to the pharmacist(subscription)
• Instructions for the patient
• signature of the doctor",,D,,
6,A patient started on antihypertensive presented with the following picture. which of the following drugs is the most likely cause?,"a) Lisinopril
b) Nifedipine
c) Atenolol
d) clonidine","The image shows edema over the lips and face and its occurrence following intake of an antihypertensive is suggestive of drug-induced angioedema. Lisinopril being an ACE inhibitor is most likely to be responsible for this condition.
Angioedema with ACE inhibitors:
In very few patients(o.1%-o.5%), ACE inhibitors cause rapid swelling in the nose, throat, mouth, glottis, larynx, lips, or tongue. once the drug is stopped symptoms improve drastically over hours. Angioedema of the intestine can occur very rarely.
ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema is a class effect, and patients who develop this adverse event should not be prescribed any other drugs within the ACE inhibitor class.
other adverse effects ofACE inhibitors:
Hypotension - A sudden fall in blood pressure can occur following the first dose ofACE inhibitors.
Cough - It can produce a bothersome dry cough due to the accumulation of bradykinin, substance P, or prostaglandins in the lungs. The cough usually disappears within 4 days of the stoppage of the drug.
Hyperkalemia due to K+ retention can occur.
Acute renal failure can occur with ACE inhibitors in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis, stenosis of the artery to a single remaining kidney, heart failure, or volume depletion due to diarrhea or diuretics.
It should be discontinued in pregnant women as it can cause developmental defects.
It can also cause maculopapular skin rash in some cases.
other options:
option B: Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker. Common adverse effects include headache, flushing, and dizziness. Peripheral edema may rarely occur.
option C: Atenolol is a beta 1 selective antagonist. Bradycardia, fatigue, cold extremities are common adverse effects. CNS side effects like nightmares and depression are less frequent with atenolol than other beta-blockers.
option D: Clonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. The main adverse effects of clonidine are dry mouth and sedation. Bradycardia and sexual dysfunction are other effects.",1146-758.PNG,A,,
7,A patient on aspirin presented with occult blood in the stool. This is due to inhibition of____ by aspirin,"a) phospholipase A2
b) Thromboxane
c) phospholipase c
d) phospholipase D","Aspirin causes inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1(Cox-1) which would inhibit the formation of thromboxane A2. Thromboxane A2 is an inducer of platelet aggregation and is a potent vasoconstrictor. Hence inhibition of its formation is responsible for the bleeding complications of aspirin.
Aspirin is a noncompetitive, irreversible inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase(Cox) enzyme. It is a nonselective Cox inhibitor and inhibits both Cox-1 and Cox-2.
uses of aspirin:
• Analgesic and antipyretic uses.
• Acute rheumatic fever
• Rheumatoid arthritis
• post myocardial infarction and stroke due to its antiplatelet action.
• prevention of preeclampsia Adverse effects:
Nausea, vomiting, epigastric discomfort, and increased occult blood in stools are seen with analgesic doses(o.5-2g/day). Antiinflammatory doses(3-5g/day) can produce salicylism characterized by dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, hyperventilation, reversible loss of hearing and vision, etc. It can cause elevation of liver enzymes and hepatic damage. Hypersensitivity reactions are also seen.
Reye's syndrome is a rare condition that can occur when salicylates like aspirin are given in children having viral infections like influenza.",,B,,
8,"A 6o-year-old postmenopausal female patient with a previous history of colle's fracture came with complaints of lower backache. on evaluation, her T score was -2.5. which of the following statements are false about the management of her condition?","a) Teriparatide should be started before supplementing with bisphosphonates
b) Bisphosphonates are not given for more than a year
c) calcium requirement is 12oo mg per day
d) oral vitamin D3 is given along with oral calcium","Bisphosphonates are given for periods of more than one year (option B is false). In this case, as the patient is having a history of osteoporotic fracture, teriparatide can be given before bisphosphonates.
pharmacologic management of osteoporosis:
Bisphosphonates: These are pyrophosphate analogs that act by directly inhibiting bone resorption. The antiresorptive action is mainly due to its direct inhibitory effect on osteoclasts. It causes osteoclast apoptosis as well as the prevention of hydroxyapatite dissolution. Long-term bisphosphonates therapy is given for durations of 3-5 years, depending on the fracture risk of the patient. Since they are associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures, a drug holiday may be advised after long-term management.
Teriparatide is a recombinant PTH analog that has an anabolic effect on bone homeostasis by increasing osteoblastic activity. It increases bone mineral density and decreases the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women. Indications of teriparatide therapy include the history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, intolerance, or failure of previous osteoporosis therapy. It is only approved for 2 years of use. clinical trials that used teriparatide prior to bisphosphonate have been proven effective.
Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody with a mechanism of action similar to that of osteoprotegerin (oPG). It binds to RANK Ligand (RANKL), thereby inhibiting its binding to the RANK receptor of the surface of osteoclasts. This prevents RANK receptor activation and subsequent bone resorption.
Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) - Estrogen has a protective effect that prevents accelerated bone loss. This is carried out by reducing the bone resorption effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Keeping in line with these effects, osteoporosis prevention in postmenopausal women has been attributed to the use of SERMs such as raloxifene. It acts as an estrogen agonist on the bone and liver.
calcium and vitamin D supplementation: calcium supplementation in the elderly suppresses bone turnover and improves bone mineral density. 12oomg of calcium is daily required in adults of more than 5o years of age. vitamin D supplementation with 4oo-8ooIU/day improves intestinal calcium absorption, suppresses bone remodeling, and improves bone mineral density.",,B,,
9,"A patient presented with a history of multiple episodes of vomiting. He was given an intravenous drug, and later, he developed abnormal movements. which of the following can be used to treat him?","a) Hyoscine
b) cyproheptadine
c) Levodopa
d) Benzhexol","Benzhexol should be used in the management of this patient. The development of abnormal movements following an anti-emetic injection suggests that the antiemetic used in this case is probably metoclopramide.
Metoclopramide is a dopamine receptor antagonist used as a prokinetic and anti-emetic agent. It can produce extrapyramidal side effects and dystonia is seen acutely following intravenous injections. Anticholinergics like benzhexol (trihexyphenidyl) are used in the management of these side effects. Benzhexol is a centrally-acting anticholinergic agent. It acts by restoring the cholinergic balance in the striatal interneurons.
Extrapyramidal side effects of metoclopramide are commonly seen in children and young adults with higher doses. Acute dystonia occurs after intravenous administration, while parkinsonian-like symptoms develop weeks after therapy. It is managed with the discontinuation of metoclopramide and with anticholinergics or antihistaminics. Irreversible tardive dyskinesia can occur with chronic treatment.
other adverse effects:
It can cause galactorrhea by its dopamine antagonism. Methemoglobinemia can occur if used in infants.
other options:
option A: Hyoscine (scopolamine): It is a muscarinic receptor antagonist used in the management of motion sickness and vomiting.
option B: cyproheptadine is an H1 receptor antagonist used in the management of various allergy-related conditions like allergic rhinitis, anaphylaxis, urticaria, etc.
option c: Levodopa is the precursor of dopamine and it is given in combination with carbidopa for the management of parkinsonism.",,D,,
10,what formula is the dosing rate of a drug based on?,"a) clearance / plasma concentration
b) clearance x plasma concentration
c) clearance x loading dose
d) clearance / loading dose","The formula for drug dosing rate is clearance x plasma concentration.
The equation for dose rate given here is based on steady-state concentration. when a drug is given repeatedly at short intervals it will accumulate in the body until the elimination of the drug matches its input. So steady-state concentration is the plasma concentration at which the drug elimination and drug input balance each other.
Steady-state concentration(cpss) ? Dose rate / clearance
From this equation dose rate for a target steady-state plasma concentration is calculated as Dose rate ? clearance(cL) x target plasma concentration(cpss)",,B,,
11,"A patient on digoxin, potassium chloride, clarithromycin, atenolol, and triamterene developed atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular rate. Serum digoxin levels were raised. which of his medications is responsible for the same?","a) Potassium chloride
b) clarithromycin
c) Atenolol
d) Triamterene","Elevated serum digoxin levels and the development of atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular rate are suggestive of digoxin toxicity. clarithromycin when given along with digoxin can cause digoxin toxicity.
P-glycoprotein pumps play a major role in the elimination of digoxin. Drugs that inhibit P-glycoprotein can thereby decrease the elimination of digoxin and lead to digoxin toxicity.
Macrolide antibiotics like clarithromycin and erythromycin are inhibitors of the P-glycoprotein. So clarithromycin when given along with digoxin can cause digoxin toxicity.
other drugs that inhibit P-glycoprotein are - Amiodarone, quinidine, verapamil, diltiazem, cyclosporine, itraconazole, propafenone, and flecainide.
Digoxin is one of the cardiac glycosides which is derived from the digitalis plant and used clinically.
It inhibits Na+/k+ ATPase, a membrane-bound transporter to increase intracellular sodium. As a result, there is less expulsion of calcium from the cell by sodium-calcium exchanger (NcX). Increased calcium inside the myocyte leads to an increase in cardiac contractility.
The most common cardiac manifestations of digitalis toxicity include atrioventricular junctional rhythm, premature ventricular depolarizations, ventricular bigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, and second-degree Av blockade.
Factors that increase the risk of digoxin toxicity are:
• Hypercalcemia
• Hypomagnesemia
• Hypokalemia- It increases the binding of the digoxin to the Na+/k+ ATPase pump.
• Drugs causing hypokalemia- loop and thiazide diuretics, amphotericin B, corticosteroids
• Drugs that decrease digoxin elimination (inhibitors of P-glycoprotein)
• Renal failure
• Hypothyroidism
Triamterene, atenolol, and potassium chloride cause hyperkalemia, and therefore do not cause digoxin toxicity.",,B,,
12,what is the mechanism of action of methotrexate in osteosarcoma?,"a) Analog of UMP
b) competitive inhibitor of DHFR
c) Blocks purine synthesis
d) Blocks pyrimidine synthesis","The anticancer activity of methotrexate is by inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR).
Methotrexate belongs to the antimetabolite class of anticancer drugs. The antifolate action of the drug is responsible for its anti-cancer properties.
Mechanism of action:
It is a folic acid analog and binds to the active catalytic site of dihydrofolate reductase(DHFR).
This would inhibit the formation of tetrahydrofolate(THF) which is needed for purine nucleotides, thymidylate, and the amino acids serine and methionine. This would interfere with the production of DNA, RNA, and important cellular proteins.
Low doses of methotrexate are used in the management of rheumatic diseases. It is due to the inhibition of amino-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) transformylase and thymidylate synthetase. This results in increased levels of adenosine that inhibits inflammation.
Adverse effects:
common side effects are nausea and mucosal ulcers. others include anemia, leukopenia, stomatitis, GI ulcerations, and alopecia. Dose-related hepatotoxicity is also seen. The GI effects and hepatotoxicity can be reduced by the use of leucovorin or folinic acid.",1157-759.PNG,B,,
13,what should not be consumed by patients with bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis on metronidazole?,"a) Grapefruit juice
b) Alcohol
c) Benzodiazepine
d) MAOI/SSRI","Alcohol should not be consumed by a patient on metronidazole. Metronidazole produces a disulfiram-like reaction. If the patient consumes alcohol during or within 3 days of therapy, they may experience abdominal distress, vomiting, headache, and flushing.
Disulfiram and disulfiram-like reactions:
Disulfiram inhibits the aldehyde dehydrogenase(ALDH) activity and thereby increases the concentration of acetaldehyde in the blood. when a person treated with disulfiram consumes alcohol he or she would develop symptoms of acetaldehyde poisoning. The symptoms are:
• Flushing
• pulsating headache
• Nausea and vomiting
• sweating
• Tachycardia
• Hypotension
• orthostatic syncope
• vertigo
• Blurred vision
certain drugs can also produce disulfiram-like reactions if alcohol is consumed along with these drugs. patients should be warned not to use alcohol along with these drugs. The drugs include:
• Metronidazole
• Tinidazole
• cefoperazone
• sulfonylureas",,B,,
14,A patient with chronic kidney disease underwent a nephrectomy. which of the following can be administered as a postoperative analgesic in this patient?,"a) Naproxen
b) Indomethacin
c) Diclofenac
d) Acetaminophen","Acetaminophen can be given as an analgesic for the patient as it is the least nephrotoxic among the given options.
Analgesia in cKD patients:
Acetaminophen is considered a safer non-narcotic analgesic in chronic kidney disease (cKD) patients. For more severe pains opioid analgesics like tramadol or fentanyl are used.
Even though acetaminophen is considered safe, with chronic high dosage it can also become nephrotoxic.
NSAIDs like naproxen, indomethacin, diclofenac, etc are not used in CKD patients because of their direct nephrotoxic effects. In healthy normal individuals, NSAIDs have little effect on renal function and blood pressure. But in conditions where the regulatory systems are impaired as hypovolemia, congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, or other conditions where the renin-angiotensin system is activated, renal function by the formation of prostaglandins are very important.
NSAIDs cause impairment of prostaglandin-induced inhibition of chlorine reabsorption and antidiuretic hormone action. This will cause salt and water retention. It also inhibits Cox-2 derived prostaglandins which regulate the renal medullary blood flow and would lead to a rise in blood pressure, increased cardiovascular thrombotic events, and cardiac failure. It can also cause electrolyte abnormalities like hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.",,D,,
15,"A patient with renal insufficiency presented with very low urine output, pedal edema, headache and BP 16o/9o. which anti-hypertensive can be administered?","a) Aliskiren
b) chlorthalidone
c) Amlodipine
d) Prazosin","The antihypertensive that can be given in this case is chlorthalidone. The patient in this case is having renal insufficiency but there is no proteinuria mentioned in the question stem. So among the given options, the thiazide diuretic chlorthalidone can be administered as antihypertensive in this patient.
Management of hypertension in chronic kidney disease(CKD):
ACE inhibitors or ARBs are considered the first-line drugs in patients with proteinuria. These agents effectively reduce blood pressure, proteinuria and prevent kidney decline. Calcium channel blockers can be added if necessary.
For patients who do not have proteinuria, there is no established first-line therapy. one or two of the following drugs can be used:
• Thiazides/thiazide-like diuretics
• ACE inhibitors or ARBs
• Calcium channel blockers
In patients presenting with fluid retention or fluid overload, thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide are recommended for management. In CKD stages 1 to 3 (GFR >?3oml/min), thiazides are recommended, while loop diuretics such as bumetanide, furosemide are used in stages 4-5 (GFR < 3oml/min).
other options:
option A: Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor. It effectively lowers blood pressure, reduces albuminuria, and limits left ventricular hypertrophy.
option C: Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker. A common side effect of amlodipine is the production of peripheral edema.
option D: prazosin is a selective a1 antagonist. It is generally not used as an initial agent to treat hypertension, except in symptomatic prostatism or nightmares linked to posttraumatic stress disorder. Headache is one of the side effects of prazosin.",,B,,
16,which of the following interleukin (IL) is inhibited by tocilizumab?,"a) IL-6
b) IL-2
c) IL-4
d) IL-5","Tocilizumab inhibits IL-6.
Tocilizumab is a newer humanized antibody. It binds to the soluble, membrane-bound IL-6 receptors and inhibits IL-6 mediated signaling. IL-6 can cause T-cell activation, acute-phase protein synthesis, and stimulation of inflammatory processes in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.
uses:
• Rheumatoid arthritis - It is a biological DMARD and is indicated in adult patients having moderate to severe disease with inadequate response to one or more DMARDs.
• Juvenile idiopathic arthritis - It can be given for active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis(SJIA) or polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis(PJIA) in patients of 2 years of age or more.
Adverse effects:
Common adverse effects include upper respiratory infections, hypertension, headache, and elevation of hepatic enzymes. It is also associated with serious infections including TB and opportunistic infections. Neutropenia and reduction in platelet count can also occur.
other options:
option B- IL-2 receptor inhibitors are daclizumab, basiliximab. They are used as immunosuppressive agents following renal and heart transplants.
option C- IL-4 receptor inhibitor is dupilumab. They have been shown to reduce exacerbations in asthma.
option D- IL-5 inhibitors are mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab. They have been shown to reduce exacerbations in asthma.",,A,,
