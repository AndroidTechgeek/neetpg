Q1,which of the following is the correct statement regarding Huntington's chorea?,"a)It is a trinucleotide repeat disorder
b)There is loss of function type of mutation
c)There are abnormal repeats of CUG
d)Abnormality is seen due to mutation in chromosome 6","Huntington's chorea is a trinucleotide repeat disorder.
It is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder. It is caused by CAG
trinucleotide repeats (&gt;4o). It occurs due to a gain-of-function (expansion) mutation in the huntingtin gene on chromosome 4p.
The disease shows genetic anticipation and has an early-onset (2-3 decades) if inherited from the father.
Cognitive impairment is an early feature. pathologically, atrophy of caudate and putamen with ex vacuo ventriculomegaly is seen. Decreased acetylcholine leads to dementia and decreased GABA   and increased dopamine lead to chorea.
Treatment consists of haloperidol and tetrabenazine.
Trinucleotide repeat disorders:

Q2,which of the following statements is true about the pathology of achalasia cardia?,"a)Relaxation of lower esophageal sphincter
b)Defective peristalsis
c)Decreased release of NO and vIP in the distal part of esophagus
d)Decreased tone of the lower esophageal sphincter","Achalasia cardia is characterized by decreased release of NO(nitric oxide) and vIP(vasoactive intestinal polypeptide) in the distal part of esophagus.
Normally, NO and vIP are secreted by the inhibitory neurons of the Auerbach's plexus in the    distal esophagus. This leads to relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). In achalasia cardia, these inhibitory neurons degenerate leading to decreased release of NO and vIP. This    causes increased LES tone.
The triad of achalasia cardia is as follows:
• Incomplete relaxation of LES
• Increased tone of LES
• Absent peristalsis (aperistalisis)",,C,

Q14,"A 52-year-old male patient comes with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. A peripheral blood smear reveals macrocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils and an
endoscopy reveals atrophic gastritis. which of the following conditions is likely to be seen this patient?","a)vitamin B12 deficiency
b)Folate deficiency
c)pyridoxine deficiency
d)Niacin deficiency","The given findings are suggestive of pernicious anemia, which is associated with atrophic gastritis and vitamin B12 deficiency.
Anemic patient with a peripheral smear showing macrocytic RBCs and hypersegmented
neutrophils are important characteristic features of megaloblastic anemia. vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency are the main causes of megaloblastic anemia.
pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of autoantibodies
which impairs the production or activity of the intrinsic factor (IF). This is required for the uptake of vitamin B12. There are three types of autoantibodies namely, type I, II, and III. The action of
each of these include:
• Autoantibody type I prevents the binding of vitamin B12 to the intinsic factor (IF).
• Autoantibody type II prevents the binding of vitamin B12-IF complex to the ileal receptors.
• Autoantibody type III acts against the α and β subunits of the gastric proton pump, which impairs the production of intrinsic factor.
These patients also develop chronic atrophic gastritis, characterized by loss of parietal cells, infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells and megaloblastic changes in mucosal cells.",,A,

d)Lobular carcinoma","The given scenario is suggestive of colloid or mucinous carcinoma of the breast.
Colloid carcinoma is an invasive breast carcinoma, which shows intracellular and extracellular mucin deposition.

Q16,which of the following is true about the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease?,"a)Failure of migration of neural crest cells
b)Loss of ganglion cells
c)visceral myopathy
d)obstruction by inflammatory stricture","Hirschsprung disease occurs due to the failure of migration of the neural crest cells to the bowel wall.
During normal embryogenesis, the neural crest cells migrate from the caecum to the rectum. The enteric neuronal plexuses develop from these migrated neural crest cells.
In Hirschsprung disease, there is an arrest in the migration of these cells, which leads to the development of a distal intestinal segment that is devoid of Meissner (submucosal) and the



Auerbach (myenteric) plexus. Hence this segment is referred to as the aganglionic segment.
As a result, there is a lack of coordination in the peristaltic contractions and functional
obstruction, which further leads to the dilation of the intestine proximal to the affected segment, leading to congenital megacolon. Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the absence of
ganglion cells in biopsy sections.


some conditions may cause acquired megacolon. These include:
• chagas disease, due to the loss of ganglion cells
• visceral myopathy
• obstruction by neoplasm or inflammatory stricture
• Toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis
• Functional psychosomatic disorders",,A,
Q17,premature aging in werner syndrome is due to:,"a)Increased telomerase activity
b)Defect in DNA helicase
c)Increase in length of telomere due to decrease in telomerase activity
d)None of the above","premature aging in werner syndrome is due to a defect in DNA helicase.

unwinding. A defect in this enzyme causes rapid accumulation of damaged chromosomes that may mimic the injury that normally accumulates during cellular aging.",,B,

b)Neurofibroma
c)Neuroma
d)Glioma","The histopathological examination is suggestive of schwannoma. Features showing spindle cells with palisading nuclei and verocay bodies are characteristic of schwannoma.



schwannomas are well-circumscribed, encapsulated masses that abut the associated nerve

Microscopically, it consists of dense areas called Antoni A, and loose areas called Antoni B.
• The Antoni A areas contain spindle cells that are arranged into intersecting fascicles. palisading  of nuclei is seen, with nuclear-free zones between them, forming structures called verocay bodies.
• The Antoni B areas contain spindle-shaped cells that are loosely arranged separated by prominent myxoid extracellular matrix.

recipient who has the same genetic constitution as the donor. For example, graft between identical twins.",,C,
Q22,Histology of reperfused myocardium:,"a)wavy fibres
b)Neutrophils in cardiac muscle
c)swelling of cells
d)Eosinophilc contraction band","Reperfused myocardium shows eosinophilic contraction bands on light microscopy. They occur   in irreversibly injured myocytes with damaged membranes, when blood supply is restored 12-24 hours after MI.
During ischemia, the intracellular levels of calcium are increased due to impaired calcium cycling and sarcolemmal damage. This leads to augmented and uncontrolled contraction of myofibrils
after reperfusion.
on microscopic examination, the irreversibly injured myocytes exhibit contraction bands that are intensely eosinophilic intracellular stripes. These contraction bands are composed of closely
packed sarcomeres.
Reperfused infarcts are usually hemorrhagic because the vasculature is injured during ischemia. This leads to bleeding after the flow is restored.",,D,
Q23,All-trans retinoic acid is used in the treatment of tumor that is associated with which of the following genetic aberrations?,"a)PML-RARA
b)BCRABL
c)cMYC
d)RUNX1 ETO","All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML), which is associated with PML-RARA fusion gene.
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) is associated with a reciprocal translocation between  chromosomes 15 and 17 producing a PML-RARA fusion gene. This fusion gene encodes for a chimeric protein, which consists of a part of the PML protein and a part of the retinoic acid   receptor-α (RARα).
The normal RARα binds to the DNA and activates the transcription in the presence of retinoids.  However, the chimeric protein produced by PML-RARA has reduced affinity for retinoids. This     causes inhibition of transcription, thereby preventing gene expression for cellular differentiation. This leads to the accumulation of myeloid progenitor cells.
The condition is treated with all-trans retinoic acid. It binds to the PML-RARA chimeric protein.   This causes conformational change such that the protein regains its normal function and activates DNA transcription.",,A,
