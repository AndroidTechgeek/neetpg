Q1,From which of the following structure does the saccule develop?,"a)saculus anterior
b)saculus posterior
c)pars superior
d)pars inferior","The saccule develops from pars inferior.
The development of the inner ear begins in the 3rd week of fetal life and is completed by the 16th week. The surface ectoderm on each side of the rhombencephalon thickens to form otic/auditory   placodes, which then invaginate to form the otic vesicle (otocysts).
The cells of the otic vesicle differentiate to form ganglion cells, which later develop into the    vestibulocochlear ganglia. Later each otic vesicle divides into a dorsal component called pars superior and a ventral component called pars inferior.
pars superior gives rise to the utricle, semicircular canals, and endolymphatic ducts. pars inferior gives rise to saccule and cochlear duct. The saccule is connected to the cochlea through a narrow  duct called ductus reuniens.",,D,
Q2,what is the surgery done to widen the cartilaginous part of the external auditory canal called?,"a)Meatoplasty
b)Tympanoplasty
c)Myringoplasty
d)otoplasty","The surgery done to widen the cartilaginous part of the external auditory canal is meatoplasty.
Meatoplasty is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of a crescent-shaped portion of
conchal cartilage to widen the external auditory meatus. It is performed in combination with all   canal wall-down procedures like modified radical and radical mastoidectomies, for easy access to the mastoid cavity for periodic inspection and cleaning.
It is also done as an isolated procedure in elderly people with sagging auricles. A
sagging auricle causes obstruction to the meatus leading to the retention of wax and difficulty in hearing.
other options:
option B: Tympanoplasty is the surgical reconstruction to correct damage in the middle ear and restore the integrity of the tympanic membrane for improved hearing. It is ossicular
reconstruction only or ossicular reconstruction with myringoplasty.
option C: Myringoplasty refers to the reconstruction of the tympanic membrane only.
option D: otoplasty is the correction of external ear/deformities of the pinna.",,A,
Q3,cough on scratching the external acoustic canal is due to?,"a)Auriculotemporal nerve
b)Auricular branch ofvagus
c)Great auricular nerve
d)Facial nerve","cough on scratching the external acoustic canal is due to the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (Arnold's nerve).
Arnold's nerve supplies the concha and corresponding eminence on the medial surface. It also
supplies the posterior wall and floor of the external auditory canal. scratching or mechanical
stimulation of the ear leads to activation of Arnold's nerve, which evokes reflex cough (ear-cough reflex/otorespiratory reflex).
The image below shows the nerve supply of the pinna:

Q4,which of the following is not a feature of tubercular otitis media?,"a)Ear ache
b)Multiple perforations
c)pale granulation
d)Foul smelling ear discharge","Earache is not a feature of tubercular otitis media. It is a painless condition.
Tuberculosis of the ear is usually secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis. It occasionally spreads   hematogenously, from a tubercular focus in the lungs, tonsils, and cervical or mesenteric lymph nodes
It presents as a painless condition with foul-smelling discharge from the ear, that does not
respond to standard antibiotic treatment. patients have severe hearing loss that is out of
proportion to symptoms. Although predominantly conductive, sensorineural hearing loss may also occur if the labyrinth is involved.
A thickened tympanic membrane with multiple perforations in pars tensa of the tympanic membrane and pale granulations in the middle ear cleft is seen.
The image below shows the tympanic membrane in tuberculous otitis media:





Histopathology shows submucosal tubercles with Langhans giant cells and caseous
necrosis. smears and culture of ear discharge may be positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Evidence of primary pulmonary tuberculosis may also be seen on chest radiography.
Facial nerve palsy is a common complication. Mastoiditis, postauricular fistula, and osteomyelitis are also seen.
Treatment includes aural toilet, treatment of secondary bacterial infections, and a full course of antitubercular therapy followed by reconstructive surgery.",,A,3250-2010.PNG
Q5,"A person who met with an accident, and suffered from a skull fracture presents with the following finding. Identify this clinical finding.","a)Battle sign
b)Bezold abscess
c)Mastoiditis
d)Griesinger sign","The given image shows ecchymosis over the retro auricular and mastoid area suggestive of Battle's sign. It is typically seen in fractures of the middle cranial fossa following head trauma. Battle sign  is prominent when there is a fracture of the petrous temporal bone.
other options:
option B: Bezold abscess is a complication of acute otomastoiditis where the infection/pus breaks through the thin medial side of the tip of the mastoid and presents as a swelling in the upper part of the neck.





option C: Acute mastoiditis is used to refer to an acute infection that spreads from the mucosa lining the mastoid air cells to involve the bony walls of the mastoid air cell system. Mastoiditis  presents as retro-auricular redness and swelling which is painful.
The image below shows a smooth ironed-out mastoid with erythema seen in acute mastoiditis.


option D: The Griesinger sign refers to edema of the postauricular soft tissues overlying
the mastoid process as a result of thrombosis of the mastoid emissary vein seen in sagittal sinus thrombosis. It is a complication of acute otomastoiditis.",3257-2015.PNG,A,3263-2019.PNG;3263-2018.PNG
Q6,surgery where nostrils are partially or completely occluded is done for which condition?,"a)vasomotor rhinitis
b)Atrophic rhinitis
c)Invasive aspergillosis
d)Allergic rhinitis","Complete closure of the nostrils (young's operation) or partial closure of the nostrils (Modified young's operation) is done for the treatment of atrophic rhinitis.



In young's operation, both nostrils are closed completely by raising flaps within the nasal
vestibule. They are opened after 6 months. During this time, the mucosa becomes normal, and the crusting is reduced.
In Modified young's operation, the procedure has been modified to avoid discomfort from
complete closure of the nostrils. Here the nostrils are only partially closed. The results are the same when compared to young's operation.
Atrophic rhinitis (ozaena) is a chronic inflammation of the nose with atrophy of nasal mucosa and turbinate bones. Roomy nasal cavities with foul-smelling crusts are seen. The patient presents
with a foul smell from the nose, marked anosmia (merciful anosmia), and paradoxical nasal
obstruction (nasal obstruction despite wide nasal passages). paradoxical nasal obstruction occurs due to degenerative changes in the sensory nerves of the nasal mucosa, leading to an inability to  sense airflow.
Medical management includes nasal irrigation and removal of crusts. 25% glucose in glycerine, antibiotics (quinolones or metronidazole), estradiol nasal spray, and mucolytics can be used.",,B,
Q7,what is occipitomental view with open mouth also known as?,"a)water's view
b)Towne's view
c)Law's view
d)stenver's view","occipitomental view is called water's view. water's view with an open mouth is known as pierre's view. Among the given options, water's view is the best answer.
In water's view, the patient’s head is positioned such that the nose and the chin touch the film while the X-rays are projected from backward. The mouth is usually kept open, which allows     visualizing the sphenoid sinus.
structures seen in water’s view are:
• Maxillary sinuses (seen best)
• Frontal sinuses
• sphenoid sinus (if the film is taken with an open mouth)
• zygoma
• zygomatic arch
• Nasal bone
• Frontal process of the maxilla
• superior orbital fissure
• Infratemporal fossa
other options:
option B: Towne's view is an angled anteroposterior radiograph of the skull. structures seen are    the petrous part of the pyramids, arcuate eminence, superior semicircular canal, mastoid antrum, internal auditory canal, tympanic cavity, cochlea, and external auditory canal. This view is taken   for acoustic neuroma and apical petrositis.
option C: Law's view is a lateral oblique X-ray view of the mastoid. structures seen are the
external auditory canal, mastoid air cells, tegmen, lateral sinus plate, and temporomandibular



joint.
option D: stenver's view is an X-ray view of the skull where the long axis of the petrous bone is parallel to the film. structures seen are the entire petrous pyramid, arcuate eminence, internal   auditory meatus, labyrinth with its vestibule, cochlea, and mastoid antrum.",,A,
Q8,"A 9-year-old boy comes with complaints of right ear pain, difficulty in opening the mouth,
painful swallowing, and fever. The oral cavity examination reveals the following. The external facial examination is unremarkable. which of the following is likely?","a)pharyngitis
b)parotid abscess
c)Bezold’s Abscess
d)Quinsy","The given clinical scenario describes a child with fever, otalgia, trismus, and odynophagia with a normal external facial examination. The oral cavity shows congested and edematous tonsil and    tonsillar pillars with edematous uvula pushed to the opposite side. These findings are highly
suggestive of quinsy (peritonsillar abscess).
It is the collection of pus in the peritonsillar space between the fibrous capsule of the tonsil and   the superior constrictor muscles of the pharynx. Both aerobic and anaerobic organisms are seen.
patient presents with fever, unilateral throat pain, odynophagia, hot potato voice, torticollis, foul breath, referred otalgia through glossopharyngeal nerve and trismus due to spasm of pterygoid    muscles.
oral cavity examination may show congested and edematous tonsils, pillars, and soft palate on the involved side. Edematous uvula pushed to the opposite side. pus may be seen on the tonsillar
region. Jugulodigastric lymph nodes may be enlarged.
The management of quinsy is by antibiotics and incision and drainage to drain the abscess followed by interval tonsillectomy 4 to 6 weeks later.
Rare complications seen are parapharyngeal abscess, edema of the larynx, septicemia, lung abscess, or jugular vein thrombosis.
other options:
option A: pharyngitis presents with fever, throat pain, enlarged tonsils, and lymphoid follicles on the posterior pharyngeal wall.
option B: parotid abscess occurs due to the suppuration of parotid space. It presents with
swelling, redness, firmness, and tenderness in the parotid area and at the angle of the mandible. It is usually unilateral, but bilateral abscesses can occur. Due to the thick capsule, fluctuation is
often difficult to elicit.
option C: Bezold abscess is a complication of acute otomastoiditis where the infection/pus breaks through the thin medial side of the tip of the mastoid and presents as a swelling in the upper part of the neck.",3258-2016.PNG,D,
