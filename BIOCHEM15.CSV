Question 1,A patient underwent gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma. which of the following vitamins needs to be supplemented in this patient?,"a) vitamin B12
b) vitamin B1
c) vitamin A
d) vitamin D","A patient who has undergone gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma needs to be supplemented with vitamin B12.
vitamin B12 absorption is a complex process that relies on several factors. Intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the parietal cells in the stomach, is essential for this process. Gastric acid and pepsin release vitamin B12 from dietary proteins, allowing it to bind with cobalophilin in the saliva. In the jejunum, cobalophilin is broken down, freeing vitamin B12 to bind with intrinsic factor. This complex is then absorbed in the distal ileum through specific receptors. Following gastrectomy, the production of intrinsic factor is impaired due to the removal of gastric tissue, making vitamin B12 absorption difficult. Therefore, vitamin B12 supplementation is necessary after gastrectomy to prevent deficiency.
other complications of gastrectomy include:
• Nutritional deficiencies- Iron deficiency anemia (most common), vitamin B12 deficiency, and osteoporosis
• Dumping syndrome: early and late
• Diarrhea
• Duodenal stump leak/blow out
• Bile reflux gastritis and esophagitis
• Gall stones
• Roux syndrome",,A,
Question 2,"A 1o-year-old child from a southern Indian state, hailing from a poor family, presents with rough and scaly skin. The child’s diet lacks vegetables and fruits. After treatment with linseed oil, vitamin A, and vitamin B, the symptoms subsided. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a) Lichen planus
b) Erythroderma
c) phrynoderma
d) keratosis pilaris","The cutaneous lesions with rough and scaly skin, with dietary history stating lack of vegetables and fruits is suggestive of phrynoderma.
phrynoderma are keratotic follicular papules commonly present over the elbows and knees. They can also extend to the shoulders, neck, back, thighs, buttocks, and abdomen. It is also known as toad skin, due to the rough cone-shaped elevated papules. It can be caused by deficiency of vitamins A, B complex, C, and E and essential fatty acids.
when it occurs due to vitamin A deficiency, it is associated with ophthalmic symptoms like xerophthalmia, night blindness, and Bitot's spots and cutaneous symptoms like xerosis, scaling, and acne.
Management includes nutritional improvement through diet, multivitamin supplementation, and treatment of the underlying cause.
Note: Linseed oil is rich in alpha-linolenic acid, which is an essential fatty acid.
The toad skin appearance of a child with phrynoderma is given below:
other options:
option A: Lichen planus is a papulosquamous lesion presenting as pruritic, purple, polygonal, planar, papules and plaques. These papules are often highlighted by white dots or lines called wickham striae, which are created by areas of hypergranulosis. The characteristic lesions in lichen planus are shown below:
option B: Erythroderma is a serious skin condition characterized by widespread redness (erythema) and scaling affecting more than 9o% of the body's surface area. It is also known as exfoliative dermatitis and often results from underlying skin disorders, systemic diseases, or drug reactions.
option D: keratosis pilaris is an inherited abnormality of keratinization. It affects the follicular orifices leading to keratotic follicular plugging, perifollicular erythema, and follicular atrophy. It usually occurs during puberty. They present as small, keratotic papules on the extensor aspects of the limbs, particularly the arms which can lead to ingrowing of the hair. Treatment is purely reserved for cosmetic purposes.",,C,"IMAGE A,IMAGE B,IMAGE C;extra1.png;957-717.PNG;957-716.PNG"
Question 3,"A patient presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The laboratory results show serum triglyceride levels > 2ooo mg/dl. which deficiency could be contributing to the patient's condition?","a) Apolipoprotein C II
b) Apolipoprotein B48
c) Apolipoprotein B1oo
d) Apolipoprotein A I","The elevated triglyceride levels and symptoms of acute pancreatitis are likely related to a deficiency in apolipoprotein C II.
Apolipoprotein C2 is a lipoprotein lipase cofactor that catalyzes cleavage of chylomicrons. Defective apo C II results in type I hyperlipoproteinemia/ familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency. The resulting inactive lipoprotein lipase leads to slow clearance of chylomicrons and VLDL, and low levels of LDL and HDL. Patients present with eruptive xanthomas and acute pancreatitis.
Lipoprotein lipase is an extracellular enzyme that is present in the capillary walls of most tissues. It is chiefly synthesized by the adipose tissue, and cardiac and skeletal muscles. A deficiency of lipoprotein lipase or apo C-II leads to type 1 hyperlipoproteinemia or familial chylomicronemia which leads to an increased risk of acute pancreatitis.
other options:
option B: Apo B48 is involved in the assembly of chylomicrons. Defects in this protein are not associated with familial hypercholesterolemia.
option C: Apo B1oo binds low-density lipoprotein receptors. For the uptake of LDL, apo B1oo acts as a ligand for the low-density lipoprotein receptor.
option D: Apo A1 activates lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). LCAT is the enzyme present in HDL, which is activated by apo A1. LCAT converts free cholesterol (amphipathic) in HDL to cholesterol ester(hydrophobic). The initial discoidal shape now becomes spherical. This facilitates reverse cholesterol transport.",,A,
Question 4,"After the age of 12, the boy had an intellectual disability. On examination, fingernail abrasions, excessive biting of lips, and increased levels of serum uric acid were observed. what is the likely diagnosis?","a) Hurler syndrome
b) Lesch-Nyhan disease
c) Hunter syndrome
d) von Gierke syndrome","The above clinical scenario with findings showing self-mutilation and laboratory values of hyperuricemia is most likely suggestive of Lesch-Nyhan disease.
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder due to a complete deficiency of the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). This deficiency results in an inability to salvage hypoxanthine or guanine leading to increased levels of phospho-ribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP). Increased PRPP leads to increased purine synthesis, which is later degraded to uric acid. Increased hypoxanthine is also converted to uric acid.
The patients have intellectual disability, behaviors of self-injury like lip and finger biting, developmental delay, muscle dystonia, and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Diagnosis is made by the elevated levels of uric acid and by HGPRT enzyme assay.
The image given below shows the metabolism of hypoxanthine and guanine by HGPRT.
orange diaper syndrome can be an early indicator of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. At birth, individuals with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome typically appear asymptomatic, with normal prenatal growth and development. The condition is often first detected through the presence of orange-coloured crystals in the diaper, resulting from hyperuricemia. since hyperuricemia is a common feature across all variants of HGPRT deficiency, which causes Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, predicting associated neurodevelopmental abnormalities requires enzyme activity testing.",,B,IMAGE A;959-718.PNG
Question 5,"A neonate was brought with features of lethargy, and poor oral intake. On examination, a cataract was seen. urine Benedict's test was positive but negative for Glucose. what will be the enzyme deficiency in this condition?","a) Hexokinase
b) Galactokinase
c) Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase
d) phosphofructokinase","The given clinical scenario of a neonate presenting with lethargy, and poor oral intake, with examination revealing a cataract and urine benedict's test was positive but negative for glucose, is suggestive of classical galactosemia and enzyme deficient is galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase.
Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency leads to classical galactosemia. It is an autosomal recessive disorder. Normally, newborns receive up to 4o% of their intake as lactose (glucose + galactose). The deficiency of this enzyme leads to an inability to convert galactose-1-phosphate to uridine diphosphate galactose. This leads to the accumulation of galactose 1-phosphate and causes injury to the kidney, liver, and brain.
clinical features:
• Accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate in the liver causes liver damage & leads to hepatomegaly, vomiting, and convulsions.
• Accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate depletes the liver of inorganic phosphate leading to diminished ATP synthesis which affects gluconeogenesis resulting in hypoglycemia.
• Accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate in the nerves causes intellectual disability.
• Accumulation of galactitol in the lens causes oil-drop cataracts.
• Patients with galactosemia are at an increased risk of developing Escherichia coli neonatal sepsis.
In uridyl transferase deficiency, the epimerase is present in adequate amounts, so that the galactosemic individual can still form UDPGal from glucose. This explains how normal growth and development of affected children can occur despite the galactose-free diets.
Urinary reducing sugar (Benedict's test) and mucic acid test are positive. Direct enzyme assay using erythrocytes establishes the diagnosis.
Treatment is a galactose-free diet.
other options:
option A: Hexokinase is a glycolytic enzyme, involved in maintaining intracellular glucose concentration by catalysing the first step in glucose metabolism, i.e., phosphorylation of intracellular glucose. Its deficiency leads to hemolytic anaemia. splenomegaly may be another presenting feature.
option B: Galactokinase is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of galactose to galactose 1-phosphate. only cataract is seen in the deficiency of this enzyme because galactose-1-phosphate is not formed. Hence no toxic effects of this compound are manifested.
option D: Phosphofructokinase is a key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis and is necessary for the ATP-dependent conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-diphosphate. Tauri's disease is type VII glycogen storage disorder that results due to the deficiency of phosphofructokinase.",,C,IMAGE Q;960-719.PNG
Question 6,"A patient diagnosed with a rare homozygous recessive condition presented with ectopia lentis. In the peripheral smear, there was no megaloblastic anemia. Later, he was found to have elevated homocysteine levels in the blood. which of the following supplementations will help the patient?","a) Thiamine
b) pyridoxine
c) Biotin
d) Riboflavin","The vitamin that can be used as supplementation in this patient with homocystinuria is pyridoxine (vitamin B6).
classical homocystinuria is an autosomal recessive disease most commonly caused by a deficiency of the cystathionine β-synthase. The deficiency of this enzyme leads to an accumulation of homocysteine in the blood and a clinical syndrome of intellectual disability, subluxated ocular lenses, long and slender extremities, arachnodactyly, and arterial and venous thrombi. The skeletal features of homocystinuria often mimic Marfan syndrome. Folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency can also lead to homocystinuria with megaloblastic anemia.
Demonstration of elevated total homocysteine in the blood confirms the diagnosis. 5o% of the cases of homocystinuria are termed pyridoxine-responsive because large doses of pyridoxine can enhance the activity of deficient enzymes in these patients. Administration of large doses of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) restores the activity of the deficient enzyme in half of all cases of homocystinuria.
Folate supplementation is also added to overcome any folate deficiency that might occur due to increased conversion of homocysteine to methionine. For the other 5o% of the patients, the treatment consists of methionine restriction and cysteine supplementation. In addition, betaine (methyl group donor), folate and vitamin B12 may be added.",,B,IMAGE A;961-720.PNG
Question 7,You received a text message from your friend JOHN DOE about occupational exposure after he visited his doctor as shown below. what is the test used to diagnose?,"a) Anthracosis
b) Lead poisoning
c) silicosis
d) Asbestosis","The test for coproporphyrinogen levels is used as a screening test to diagnose lead poisoning.
Lead inhibits the enzymes delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase and ferrochelatase, which are involved in heme synthesis. ALA is converted to porphobilinogen by ALA dehydratase, inhibited by lead. So, serum porphobilinogen levels are decreased in lead poisoning.
Laboratory findings include the following:
• An elevated serum lead level
• An elevated level of protoporphyrin in blood and elevated ALA and coproporphyrinogen in urine
• Microcytic anemia with basophilic stippling in peripheral smear due to ineffective heme synthesis
clinical features of chronic lead poisoning include facial pallor, anemia, basophilic stippling of red cells, blue lines in the gums, and retinal stippling. In the later phase, the findings are colic abdominal pain, constipation, nerve palsy, encephalopathy, and disturbance of the genito-urinary and cardiovascular systems.
Diagnosis of lead poisoning:
Laboratory parameter: coproporphyrin in urine, Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in urine, Lead in blood, Lead in urine, Basophilic stippling of RBcs
value: >15o mc g/L, >5 mg/L, >7o mc g/dL, o.8 mg/ L, -
Remarks: screening test- indicates exp osure; Indicates lead absorption; clinical symptoms appear; Indicates lead absorption; sensitive indicator",948-712.PNG,B,IMAGE Q
Question 8,"A 3-year-old child is brought to the OPD with complaints of persistent delayed developmental milestones, and hyperpigmented macular lesions on the body which are more pronounced on exposure to sunlight. what is the error in DNA multiplication?","a) Base excision repair
b) Nucleotide excision repair
c) DNA mismatch repair
d) Homologous recombination","The history points to a diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum. It is characterized by defective nucleotide excision repair.
Uv radiation leads to pyrimidine dimerization in DNA strands, preventing further replication by DNA polymerase. The nucleotide excision repair mechanism corrects the dimer formation in DNA. Xeroderma pigmentosum (Xp) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by an inability to repair DNA pyrimidine dimers caused by Uv exposure. This leads to clinical and cellular hypersensitivity to ultraviolet (Uv) radiation.
In Xp the skin is normal at birth and has a three-stage progression:
• Diffuse erythema, scaling, and freckle-like areas over the sun-exposed regions of the body at around 6 months of age.
• The second stage is characterized by poikiloderma. This results in skin atrophy, telangiectasias with mottled hyperpigmentation, and hyperpigmentation.
• In the third stage appearance of cutaneous malignancies like squamous cell carcinomas, malignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and fibrosarcoma.
Most of the cases with Xp have ocular manifestations. Initially, it appears as photophobia, conjunctivitis, ectropion, and symblepharon with ulceration. Accumulation of pyrimidine dimer causes corneal opacification and neovascularization. ocular malignancies are common in the lids, conjunctiva, and cornea as they are exposed to as much as facial skin. Xp is ultimately fatal, and early detection of the skin lesions and their management with prevention of Uv ray exposures prolong life.",,B,
Question 9,A patient with a family history of coronary heart disease presented with tendon xanthomas. His lipid profile showed serum LDL to be 28o mg/dL and triglyceride levels was 398 mg/dl. what is the likely defect in this patient?,"a) LDL receptor defect
b) LDL metabolism
c) VLDL metabolism
d) Lipoprotein lipase deficiency","The clinical presentation with tendon xanthomas, elevated serum LDL and elevated serum triglycerides points to a diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia and is due to a defect in LDL receptors.
Familial hypercholesterolemia (type IIa hyperlipoproteinemia) is an inherited disorder due to defects in LDL receptors and Apo B1oo. This decreases the uptake of Low-density lipoprotein and cholesterol leading to their increased levels in the blood. The increased LDL accumulates in the blood vessels causing atherosclerosis (premature coronary artery disease)and in the Achilles tendon causing tendon xanthomas. Xanthomas are tumorous masses produced by foamy cell clusters (lipid-laden macrophages) found in the connective tissue of the skin and tendons. patients can also have yellowish plaques around the eyes (Xanthelasma) and corneal arcus.
Treatment includes lifestyle changes, restriction of a fatty diet, and pharmacotherapy with statins in heterozygous FH patients.
Recent drugs for specific treatment of homozygous FH are:
• Lomitapide, a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTp) inhibitor, and
• Mipomersen, an antisense oligonucleotide against apoB.
The image below shows Achilles tendon xanthoma and a plain lateral radiograph of both ankles showing bilateral symmetrical swellings (arrows) superior to the calcaneum respectively.
Note: Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency causes type I hyperlipoproteinemia due to defects in LPL or apo C-II. Eruptive xanthomas are seen. Chylomicrons and vLDL are elevated. LDL and HDL are low. There is no risk for coronary disease.",,A,"IMAGE A,IMAGE B;Picture1.png;Picture2.png"
Question 10,which food item among these is the primary source of thiamine in Indians?,"a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4","Among the various food items given on the plate, the primary source of thiamine (vitamin B1) in the Indian diet is option 4 i.e. chapati and rice.
The thiamine content in various foods in decreasing order are as follows:
• Gingelly seeds
• Groundnut
• Bengal gram
• whole wheat
• Rice
Gingelly (sesame) seeds have the highest content of thiamine.
Thiamine is lost from rice during the process of milling. As it is a water-soluble vitamin, washing, and cooking rice cause further losses. Hence, it is advisable to avoid highly polished rice and eat parboiled or under-milled rice.
Thiamine is essential for energy metabolism, particularly in carbohydrate processing. Its active form, thiamine diphosphate, acts as a coenzyme for three critical enzyme complexes: pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase. This coenzyme facilitates oxidative decarboxylation by forming a reactive carbanion that attaches to carbonyl groups like those in pyruvate, leading to the release of Co2. Thiamine diphosphate is also vital for transketolase in the pentose phosphate pathway.
Thiamine triphosphate, another form of thiamin, helps regulate nerve function by activating chloride channels in nerve membranes.
A thiamine deficiency can cause several conditions such as beriberi, characterized by peripheral neuritis, which can also involve heart failure and edema. Additionally, thiamine deficiency can lead to wernicke's encephalopathy and korsakoff's psychosis, commonly associated with alcohol or drug abuse. The lack of thiamine impairs the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, leading to increased levels of lactate and pyruvate in the blood, which can result in dangerous lactic acidosis, especially in those consuming high-carbohydrate diets.",,D,IMAGE Q;965-721.PNG
Question 11,A young female comes to the emergency department after ingesting 1o tablets of phenobarbital. which of the following components of the ETc is inhibited by this drug?,"a) succinate - Fe
b) cytochrome I-II
c) complex I to Q
d) complex IV","Phenobarbital is a barbiturate that inhibits complex I to Q of the electron transport chain.
Complex I of the electron transport chain is NADH-Q oxidoreductase. It oxidizes NADH and reduces coenzyme Q. Phenobarbital inhibits complex I to Q so that the electrons will not be able to be transferred from NADH to coenzyme Q, which is the first step in the electron transport chain. As a result, the rate of oxygen consumption will decrease.
The electron transport chain (ETC) represents the final pathway through which electrons, originating from the oxidation of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and amino acids, are channeled toward a final reaction with oxygen to produce water and ATP. The ETC complexes are embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane.
The oxidation of compounds by ETC complexes leads to the release of free energy. This is used to pump H+ to the intermembrane space. This results in the formation of a proton motive force that is used for the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. Thus, oxidation is coupled with phosphorylation to generate ATP. NADH generates 2.5 ATP and FADH2 generates 1.5 ATP.
The table below summarizes the inhibitors of the electron transport chain.
complexes of ETc: complex I:NADH-Q oxidoreductase, complex II:Succinate-Q reductase, complex III:Q- cyt c oxidoreductase, complex IV:cyt c oxidase, complex V:ATP Synthase
Inhibitors: Piericidin A,phenobarbital, r otenone; TTFA (thenoyltrifluoroaceton e), carboxin, malonate; BAL (British anti-lewisite), an timycin A; Hydrogen sulfide, carbon mo noxide, cyanide; Atractyloside, oligomycin",,C,
Question 12,"A child presents to you with bone pain, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia. A trephine biopsy aspirate shows the following finding. which of the following is the most likely enzyme deficient in this patient?","a) Galactocerebosidase
b) Glucocerebrosidase
c) sphingomyelinase
d) Alpha 1,4-glucosidase","The given clinical scenario of a child with bone pain, hepatosplenomegaly, and trephine biopsy showing Gaucher's cell with a characteristic crumpled tissue paper appearance is suggestive of Gaucher's disease. The deficient enzyme is glucocerebrosidase (also known as beta-glucosidase).
Gaucher's disease is an inborn error of metabolism caused due to a deficiency of beta-glucocerebrosidase. It is the most common lysosomal storage disorder and the mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive. There is an an accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in the spleen, liver, and other tissues.
There are three clinical subtypes - type I (chronic non-neuronopathic), type II (acute neuronopathic), and type III (intermediate). clinical features include anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and neurological features depending on the subtype.
Gaucher's cells are formed as a result of the accumulation of massive amounts of glucocerebrosides within the phagocytes. The cells have a fibrillary cytoplasm and give a crumpled tissue paper appearance.",888-689.PNG,B,IMAGE Q
Question 13,"A 32-year-old lady comes with complaints of erythematous scaly rash, loose stools, and cognitive dysfunction. The rash involved her forearm, neck, and face. she seems to have difficulty remembering things from the recent past. Her electrolytes are within normal range. she admits to having shifted to a corn-based diet due to economic reasons. which of the following would improve her symptoms?","a) oral Nicotinamide supplementation
b) High dose of IV thiamine
c) High Dose Vitamin C
d) stop corn diet","The given clinical features suggests the diagnosis of pellagra, due to her corn-based diet. oral nicotinamide supplements can improve her symtpoms.
Niacin can be synthesized in the body from tryptophan. Two compounds, nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, have the biological activity of niacin. The nicotinamide ring of the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) participate in oxidation/reduction reactions.
The initial symptoms of pellagra include loss of appetite, generalized weakness, irritability, abdominal pain, and vomiting. This is followed by bright red glossitis and a characteristic pigmented, scaly skin rash in sun-exposed areas. This rash is known as casal’s necklace when it forms a ring around the neck.
The 4Ds of pellagra:
• Diarrhea
• Dermatitis
• Dementia, leading to
• Death
It is diagnosed by measuring urinary levels of 2-methyl nicotinamide and 2-pyridone.
other options:
option B: Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency leads to conditions like beriberi and wernicke-korsakoff syndrome, which are characterized by symptoms such as muscle weakness, peripheral neuropathy, cardiovascular issues, and confusion. while cognitive dysfunction can result from thiamine deficiency, rash and loose stools do not fit with thiamine deficiency. Therefore, thiamine would not address the full spectrum of this patient’s symptoms.
option C: vitamin C deficiency causes scurvy, which is associated with symptoms like bleeding gums, bruising, joint pain, and fatigue. Scurvy is not associated with a rash like the one described, nor does it typically cause cognitive dysfunction or diarrhea. Hence, high-dose vitamin C would not improve this patient’s symptoms.
option D: Corn-based diets are low in niacin and tryptophan, leading to pellagra over time, especially if the diet is not balanced with other niacin-rich foods. while stopping the corn-based diet could prevent further niacin deficiency, it will not immediately address the existing deficiency and symptoms like rash, diarrhea, and cognitive dysfunction. The patient would still need niacin supplementation to resolve the current symptoms.",951-714.PNG,A,
Question 14,"A 3-month-old child was brought to the clinic with a history of difficulty in feeding and failure to thrive. On examination, the child is floppy, 48 cm in length and weighs 2.8 kg. There is generalized hypotonia, macroglossia and hepatomegaly. The chest x-ray of the child is given below. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a) Ebstein's anomaly
b) Pompe's disease
c) Transposition of great arteries
d) von- Gierke's disease","The child with a clinical history of difficulty feeding and failure to thrive with generalised hypotonia, macroglossia, hepatomegaly and chest x-ray findings of massive cardiomegaly suggest a diagnosis of pompe's disease.
pompe's disease is a glycogen storage disorder(type II) caused by a deficiency of lysosomal acid maltase (alpha-glucosidase) which leads to the accumulation of glycogen in the lysosomes of the liver (hepatomegaly), skeletal muscles in the form of large vacuoles (hypotonia and weakness), cardiac muscles (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). The child generally dies by the age of 2 years due to cardiac failure. The adult form presents with muscle dystrophies.
Laboratory findings show elevated levels of serum creatine kinase (Ck), aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). urine glucose tetrasaccharide, a glycogen breakdown metabolite, is a reliable biomarker for disease severity and treatment response. Treatment includes enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant enzyme a-glucosidase alfa (Myozyme).
Given below is the image of muscle biopsy showing glycogen-positive vacuoles.
other options:
option A- Ebstein's anomaly is the teratogenic effect of maternal lithium consumption which causes a cyanotic heart disease in the newborn with atrialization of the right ventricle and conduction defects. The chest X-ray will show a box-shaped enlargement of the right atrium and pulmonary oligemia.
option C- Transposition of great vessels is cyanotic congenital heart disease where there is a switch in the position of two main arteries i.e. pulmonary artery and aorta. X-ray shows of egg-on-string appearance with pulmonary plethora.
option D- von- Gierke's disease occurs due to a deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase. patients present commonly in 3-4 months of age with hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hepatomegaly, growth retardation, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia.",1024-738.PNG,B,"IMAGE A,IMAGE B;968-722.PNG"
Question 15,"A patient presented with multiple yellowish raised plaques on eyelids, xanthomas on the achilles tendon. what is the likely cause for the patient's presentation?","a) Familial hypercholesterolemia
b) Tangier's disease
c) xanthomatosis
d) Fabry's disease","The clinical presentation with yellowish, raised plaques on eyelids, and tendon xanthomas points to a diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).
Familial hypercholesterolemia (type IIa hyperlipoproteinemia) is an inherited disorder due to defects in LDL receptors and Apo B1oo. This decreases the uptake of Low-density lipoprotein and cholesterol leading to their increased levels in the blood. The increased LDL accumulates in the blood vessels causing atherosclerosis (premature coronary artery disease)and in the Achilles tendon causing tendon xanthomas. Xanthomas are tumorous masses produced by foamy cell clusters (lipid-laden macrophages) found in the connective tissue of the skin and tendons. patients can also have yellowish plaques around the eyes (Xanthelasma) and corneal arcus.
Treatment includes lifestyle changes, restriction of a fatty diet, and pharmacotherapy with statins in heterozygous FH patients.

other options:
option B: Tangier’s disease is a hypolipoproteinemia caused by a mutation of the ABCA1 gene. Enlarged orange tonsils are pathognomonic. Low HDL levels are seen. There is an increased risk for atherosclerosis.
The image below shows enlarged yellow-orange coloured tonsils in Tangier's disease.
option C: xanthomatosis is the deposition of lipids in various parts of the body like tendon xanthomas, xanthelasma, eruptive and tuberous xanthomas. This is a sign of underlying lipid metabolism disorders.
option D: Fabry's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder with a defect in alpha-galactosidase. It causes angiokeratomas, hypohidrosis and characteristic Maltese cross deposits in urine.",,A,"IMAGE A,IMAGE B,IMAGE C;969-723.PNG"
Question 16,A child presented to the OPD with complaints of fatigue and muscle weakness while exercising. Laboratory investigations found that LCFA oxidation was affected. A muscle biopsy was done which revealed the presence of fat vacuoles. what is the probable diagnosis?,"a) LDL defect
b) LPL defect
c) Fatty acid synthase defect
d) carnitine deficiency","The clinical scenario of a child with fatigue and muscle weakness on exercise with laboratory findings of LCFA oxidation deficiency and fat vacuoles on muscle biopsy suggests a diagnosis of carnitine deficiency.
Carnitine deficiency is a defect in fatty acid oxidation that leads to hypoketotic hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia. Carnitine transports activated LCFA (long chain fatty acyl CoA) from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria for beta-oxidation (as they cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane), carnitine deficiency impairs this transport causing accumulation of lipids (skeletal muscle weakness). This excess fatty acid inhibits the urea cycle causing hyperammonemia. since beta-oxidation cannot occur, energy production is reduced, and there is hypoglycemia without a corresponding increase in ketone bodies (hypoketotic) during times of glucose depletion such as exercise.
The role of carnitine in the metabolism of fatty acids is demonstrated in the image below:
clinical features of carnitine deficiency begin in childhood and include poor feeding, lethargy, liver dysfunction and hepatomegaly, hypotonia, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Treatment involves oral supplementation of carnitine.
other options:
option A: An increase in LDL can cause hyperlipoproteinemia, and reduced LDL can cause defective absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.
option B: LPL is involved in hydrolysis of lipoproteins in the blood to free fatty acid and glycerol which are then taken up by the tissues. A defective LPL can cause type 1 familial chylomicronemia syndrome presenting as pancreatitis.
option c: Fatty acid synthase is a multienzyme complex involved in fatty acid synthesis in the cytosol which when defective may impair energy production, essential fatty acids, and affect metabolic pathways. There is no accumulation of fat vacuoles since fatty acids are not synthesised.",,D,IMAGE A
Question 17,A mother came back home to see her child suffering from difficulty breathing. The child had contact with rotenone while trying to bathe their pet. The child was taken to the emergency department and she later passed away. Inhibition of which of the following enzymes was the likely cause of her death?,"a) cytochrome c reductase
b) succinate dehydrogenase
c) NADH-Q oxidoreductase
d) cytochrome oxidase","In the given clinical vignette, inhibition of NADH-Q oxidoreductase by rotenone was the likely cause of breathlessness, followed by death in this child.
Rotenone inhibits complex I, thereby inhibiting the respiratory chain, so electrons cannot be transferred to oxygen. This halts ATP production, leading to an energy deficit in the cells, eventually causing cell death. The ETc constitutes four enzyme complexes:
• complex I: NADH-Q oxidoreductase
• complex II: succinate-Q reductase
• complex III: Q-cytochrome c oxidoreductase
• complex IV: cytochrome c oxidase
components of complex I are FMN and Fe-S complex. NADH-Q oxidoreductase catalyses the transfer of electrons from NADH to coenzyme Q, along with the transfer of four H+ across the membrane.",,C,
Question 18,A child suffering from phenylketonuria was started on necessary dietary modifications but the neurological symptoms persisted. Phenylalanine hydroxylase levels in the serum are normal. which of the following enzymes is likely to be deficient in this case?,"a) Tyrosine hydroxylase
b) Homogentisate oxidase
c) Tetrahydrobiopterin synthase
d) Dopa decarboxylase","This child with phenylketonuria with neurological symptoms not improving despite dietary modifications and normal serum phenylalanine hydroxylase level is suggestive of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthase deficiency.
A diet low in phenylalanine (eg: tapioca) is the mainstay of treatment for classic phenylketonuria but may not be sufficient in BH4 deficiency where supplementation with BH4 and deficient neurotransmitter precursors (L-dopa) is required to overcome the block.
Phenylketonuria (Pku) is an inborn error of metabolism seen due to a defect in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (classic phenylketonuria) and less commonly, due to a defect in BH4 synthase (non-classical). These defects result in the impaired conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. The patient develops clinical features due to elevated levels of phenylalanine metabolites and decreased levels of tyrosine. The excess phenylalanine in the blood is metabolized to phenylpyruvate (positive ferric chloride) and phenylacetate (mousy odour) which are excreted in the urine. Infants appear normal at birth and gradually develop symptoms of hyperreflexia, seizures, hypopigmentation, low IQ, hyperactivity, and tremors.
Tandem mass spectroscopy is the investigation of choice. Guthrie test is a screening test that shows with absence of growth of Bacillus subtilis. The ferric chloride test is positive with the development of a transient blue-green colour.

option A: Tyrosine hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of epinephrine, converts tyrosine to DoPA, its deficiency does not cause phenylketonuria
option B: Homogentisic acid oxidase converts homogentisic acid to maleylacetoacetic acid in the tyrosine degradation pathway and its deficiency causes alkaptonuria with a dark colour of urine on standing, bluish-black pigmentation in connective tissue (ochronosis) and arthritis.
option D: Dopa decarboxylase is another enzyme involved in the synthesis of epinephrine. It converts DoPA to dopamine in the presence of vitamin B6. while enzymes involved in epinephrine synthesis cause neurological dysfunction, they do not cause phenylketonuria as such.",,C,
Question 19,"which micronutrient is most likely deficient in a patient with the radiographic findings given below along with anemia, neutropenia, depigmented hair and skin?","a) Iron
b) zinc
c) copper
d) Fluoride","The given clinical features of anaemia and neutropenia, along with depigmented hair and skin and the radiological findings suggestive of pelkan spurs, trummerfeld zone, Frenkel's line, and wimberger's ring sign point to the diagnosis of Menke's disease. Patients with this condition have low serum levels of copper.
Menke's disease or Menke-kinky hair syndrome is an X-linked recessive condition caused due to a mutation in the ATP7A gene on chromosome X. This causes impaired transport of dietary copper from the small intestine to the liver leading to low levels of copper-containing enzymes.
The final step of collagen synthesis involves the formation of covalent cross-links. This is done by the enzyme lysyl oxidase, a copper-containing protein. This is essential for the strength and rigidity of collagen. As a result of deficiency of copper in Menkes disease, this step of collagen synthesis is affected.
The patient presents with depigmented kinky hair, failure to thrive, neurodegenerative symptoms (loss of developmental milestones, truncal hypotonia, epilepsy), multiple fractures, anaemia due to ceruloplasmin deficiency, neutropenia, and recurrent infections.
Lab investigations show low serum copper (<65 μg/dL) and low ceruloplasmin(<2o mg/dl). The disease is fatal and has no curative treatment.
A variety of distinct anomalies that are representative of scurvy and acquired copper insufficiency can be seen on radiographs of people with menke's disease.
These include:
Early administration of L-histidine and copper chloride injections may be beneficial.
other options:
option A: Iron deficiency causes iron deficiency anemia, and hair loss (telogen effluvium. It does not cause neutropenia, depigmentation of hair and skin, or bony abnormalities.
option B: zinc deficiency causes acrodermatitis enteropathica characterized by periorificial dermatitis, diarrhea, and alopecia.
option D: Fluoride is essential for bone and teeth mineralization and its deficiency causes decreased bone-mineral density, osteoporosis, and tooth decay.",953-715.PNG,C,IMAGE Q;973-724.PNG
Question 20,"A child presented with recurrent abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea following ingestion of milk-based products. which enzyme is likely to be deficient?","a) Lipase
b) Maltase
c) Amylase
d) Lactase","The given scenario indicates intolerance of milk-based products in this child, hence, the enzyme likely to be deficient is lactase.
Lactase is the enzyme that is responsible for breaking down lactose, a disaccharide found in milk and dairy products. when this enzyme is deficient, it can lead to the accumulation of lactose in the intestinal lumen where it is fermented by intestinal bacteria to lactate which produces symptoms of lactose intolerance, including recurrent abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea after consuming lactose-rich food items. Lactase and maltase are present in the intestinal brush border.
other options:
option A- Lipases are involved in the hydrolysis of dietary triglycerides to free fatty acids and glycerol. It is deficient in exocrine pancreatic deficiency states such as chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, and crohn's. Although it might also present with abdominal pain and diarrhea, the stools are foul-smelling(due to gut bacteria) and greasy due to the presence of fat (steatorrhea) and are also associated with fat-soluble vitamin deficiency.
option B- Maltase breaks down maltose which is a disaccharide intermediate of starch breakdown.
option c- Amylase hydrolyses starch which is a glucose homopolymer and is present in germinating cereals, potatoes, legumes, and malt.",,D,
Question 21,"In the given Lineweaver-Burk plot, the blue line represents the action of an enzyme, and the red line represents the action of the same enzyme in the presence of an inhibitor. what is the type of inhibition shown here?","a) competitive inhibition
b) Non-competitive inhibition
c) uncompetitive inhibition
d) Allosteric inhibition","The given graph shows competitive inhibition, in which the value of vmax remains constant and the km value increases. The intercept on the y-axis remains unchanged while the intercept on the x-axis shifts close to zero forming a steeper slope.
competitive inhibition is when the inhibitor binds reversibly to the substrate-binding site and competes with the substrate for the active enzyme-binding site. This effect of competitive inhibition can be overcome by increasing the substrate concentration by which maximum velocity can still be achieved. Therefore, vmax (maximum velocity of the reaction) is unaltered in this type of inhibition. However, the concentration of the substrate required to achieve half of the maximum velocity is increased. Therefore, km is increased in this condition.
The graph below shows the changes in vmax and km in competitive inhibition.
other options:
option B: Non-competitive inhibition is by binding inhibitors to enzymes in locations remote from the active site. Increasing the concentration of the substrate does not overcome non-competitive inhibition. Thus, noncompetitive inhibitors decrease the vmax of the reaction. They do not interfere with the binding of the substrate to the enzyme. Thus, the enzyme shows the same km in the presence or absence of noncompetitive inhibitors.
The graph shows the changes in vmax and km in non-competitive inhibition.
option C: In uncompetitive inhibition, inhibitors bind with the enzyme-substrate intermediate complex, and inhibit it. This leads to a decrease in both vmax and km. An example is the inhibition of placental alkaline phosphate (ALP) by phenylalanine.
option D: In Allosteric inhibition, inhibitors bind to a site other than the active site i.e. allosteric site, and induce a conformational change (change in the shape of the active site unlike in non-competitive inhibition) thus, inhibiting the enzyme. ATP is an allosteric inhibitor of phosphofructokinase in glycolysis.",Picture3.png,A,IMAGE Q
