Q1,"A pregnant lady with 34 weeks of amenorrhea has the following findings: LDH - 7oo IU/L,     platelets - 75,ooo/mm3, serum bilirubin - 1.5 mg/dL, SGOT - 2oo U/L, SGPT - 15o U/L, and    BP - 14o/96 mm Hg. Her coagulation profile and renal function tests are normal. what is the diagnosis?","a)HELLP syndrome
b)Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
c)viral hepatitis
d)Intrahepatic cholestasis","The given clinical scenario with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin, low platelet count, and hypertension indicates the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome.
HELLP is an acronym for hemolysis (H), elevated liver enzymes (EL), and low platelet count (LP). It usually occurs in patients with severe preeclampsia. The patients typically present with right
upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting. Hypertension and proteinuria are seen but may be absent in some cases.
In this condition, there is periportal necrosis of the liver causing an elevation in liver enzymes (AST, ALT, and LDH) and bilirubin. Tennessee criteria used to diagnose HELLP syndrome
include:
• Platelet count - &lt;1 lakh/mm3
• AST - &gt;7o IU/L
• LDH - &gt;6oo IU/L
• Hemolysis
Prompt delivery is indicated for ≥34 weeks gestational age. vaginal delivery is the preferred route of delivery if cervix is favorable. Platelet transfusion is required if counts are less than
5o,ooo/mm3. Magnesium sulfate is given as antiseizure prophylaxis, and anti-hypertensives are given for severe hypertension.
complications of HELLP include eclampsia, placental abruption, hepatic subcapsular
hematoma, coagulopathy, stroke, and pulmonary edema.
The clinical and laboratory findings of acute liver diseases in pregnancy are as follows:

Q2,"A woman at 26 weeks of gestation presents for routine evaluation. On examination, fundal
height corresponds to 24 weeks. Ultrasonography revealed decreased amniotic fluid. which of the following conditions would have led to this presentation?","a)Renal agenesis
b)Tracheoesophageal fistula
c)cardiac abnormalities
d)Ureteral stricture","The given clinical scenario and decreased amniotic fluid on ultrasonography are suggestive of oligohydramnios. Among the given conditions, renal agenesis is the most likely cause.
oligohydramnios is a condition where the amount of amniotic fluid is reduced. The major source of amniotic fluid in the second trimester is fetal urine. when the fetus has renal agenesis, urine    production is affected. This leads to decreased amniotic fluid/oligohydramnios.
A woman with oligohydramnios usually presents with decreased fundal height for gestational age and decreased fetal movements. on examination, fetal parts can be clearly felt because of less
liquor. Fetal malpresentation and intrauterine growth retardation are seen in this condition. It is diagnosed with the help of ultrasonography when the deepest vertical pocket (DVP) of liquor
is &lt;2 cm or when the amniotic fluid index (AFI) is &lt;5 cm at gestational age, from 28 to 4o weeks.
It can lead to abortion, deformities like wry neck, club foot, etc, fetal pulmonary hypoplasia, and  cord compression. Adequate hydration and amnioinfusion can be used to manage this condition.
Polyhydramnios or hydramnios is a condition where the amount of amniotic fluid is abnormally     increased. ultrasonographic diagnosis is made when the deepest vertical pocket (DVP) is &gt;8 cm or when the amniotic fluid index (AFI) is ≥25 cm.
other options:
option D- ureteral stricture usually arises secondary to trauma or iatrogenic interventions like surgery.",,A,
Q3,"A type 1 diabetic mother is on magnesium sulfate infusion post-cesarean section for
preeclampsia. She develops delirium and is drowsy. She has a respiratory rate of 1o/min,
random blood glucose level of 24o mg/dL, oliguria, and bilaterally absent knee reflex. what is the cause of her condition?","a)Magnesium sulfate toxicity
b)Diabetic ketoacidosis
c)Eclampsia
d)Diabetes insipidus","The given clinical scenario and examination finding of bilaterally absent knee reflex following
magnesium sulfate (Mgso4) administration for preeclampsia suggest the cause of her condition to be magnesium sulfate toxicity.
Mgso4 is used as an anticonvulsant in the management of eclampsia and as prophylaxis in severe preeclampsia. It can also be used as a tocolytic to stop preterm labor. The therapeutic level of
magnesium in eclampsia is 4–7 mEq/L.



patients must be monitored for magnesium toxicity:
• Loss of deep tendon reflexes
• Decreased respiratory rate &lt;12/min
• urine output &lt;3o mL/h
• Chest pain and heart block
• Visual changes, flushing, muscle paralysis, and drowsiness
Measurement of serum magnesium levels is indicated to monitor magnesium toxicity if serum creatinine &gt;1.o mg/dL.
Management of magnesium toxicity is as follows:
• stop magnesium therapy
• Estimation of serum magnesium and creatinine levels
• Intravenous injection of calcium gluconate 1o mL (1o% solution) The two commonly used Mgso4 regimens are described below:
Repeated/maintenance dose IM injections of magnesium sulfate are continued only under the following conditions:
• The patellar reflex is present • Respiration is not depressed • urine output &gt;3o mL/h     other options:
option B: pregnant women with diabetic ketoacidosis present with hyperventilation (kussmaul breathing) and their blood glucose level is around 38o mg/dL.
option C: Eclampsia patients present with generalized tonic-clonic convulsions.
option D: Diabetes insipidus patients present with polyuria and polydipsia.

Q4,Identify the type of hymen shown in the image.,"a)Imperforate hymen
b)semilunar hymen
c)septate hymen
d)Annular hymen","The given image is suggestive of the septate hymen.
The hymen is the membranous vestige of the junction between the sinovaginal bulbs and the
urogenital sinus, which perforates during fetal life to establish a connection between the vaginal



lumen and the perineum. Defective perforation of this structure may result in the following variants of hymen
• Imperforate - without any opening
• Microperforate - tiny opening
• Annular - oval central opening
• septate - two lateral openings partitioned by a bridge of hymenal tissue
• Naviculate - boatlike opening
patients with septate hymen will typically complain of menstrual irregularities or difficulty with
tampon placement or intercourse. under topical anesthesia, a rapidly absorbable suture or free tie can be placed at the anterior and posterior aspects of the septal tissue, and the septum is resected  between the two sutures.
some of the variants ofthe hymen are:
Imperforate hymen results due to failure of canalization of the inferior end of the vaginal plate. clinical features include primary amenorrhea, cyclical abdominal pain, and bluish bulging
membranes at the vaginal opening. A simple cruciate incision in the membrane will restore normal reproductive function.",6134-3822.PNG,C,6146-3828.PNG
Q5,"while discharging a patient who underwent a vesicovaginal fistula repair, which of the following would you recommend?","a)sexual abstinence for 3 months and avoid pregnancy for a year
b)sexual abstinence for 3 weeks and avoid pregnancy for 6 months
c)sexual abstinence for 6 weeks and avoid pregnancy for a year
d)sexual abstinence for 6 months and avoid pregnancy for 6 years","while discharging a patient who underwent vesicovaginal fistula repair, sexual abstinence for 3 months and avoiding pregnancy for a year would be recommended.
Vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) is a type of urinary fistula which commonly arises due to obstetric
trauma. small fistulas due to difficult childbirth can heal spontaneously. Most established fistulas need to be repaired vaginally usually after 3 months to allow the inflammation to subside.
post-operatively, continuous bladder drainage for 14 days along with antibiotics is recommended. Vaginal or speculum examination and intercourse are not advised for 3 months. Avoiding



pregnancy for a year is also recommended. A cesarean section is usually done for future pregnancies.
presenting features of vvF include constant dribbling of urine/ true incontinence. Excoriation of the vagina, vulva, and thighs can occur due to constant contact with urine. Few patients might
develop bladder stones. vaginal urine collection can be seen on retraction of the posterior vaginal wall with a speculum. A bimanual examination can be used to assess the fixity and scarring of the surrounding tissues. A cystourethroscopy can be used for localization and assessing bladder
mucosa viability.",,A,
Q6,which of the following is an absolute contraindication for the insertion of the device shown in the image below?,"a)Menstruation
b)Trophoblastic disease
c)Immediately after delivery
d)Ruptured condom during intercourse","The given image shows a copper-containing IUCD (intrauterine contraceptive device).
Trophoblastic disease is an absolute contraindication for the insertion of this device.
In cases of uterine invasion like trophoblastic disease, there is an increased likelihood of complications related to IUCD such as perforation, misplaced device, and bleeding.
IUCDs are a type of long-term, reversible contraception. They are T-shaped devices that are inserted into the uterine cavity. These can either be copper-containing
like CuT-38oA and CuT-2oo, or hormone-containing IUCDs like Mirena.
The contraceptive action of IUCDs is because of foreign body reaction which leads to various changes in endometrial tissue that interfere with implantation. These changes include
prostaglandin release that provokes uterine contractility and tubal peristalsis and leucocytic infiltration in the endometrium. It also interferes with the migration of spermatozoa.
The contraindications for insertion of IUCD include:
• Trophoblastic disease
• Distorted uterine cavity (fibroids, uterine anomalies)
• ongoing pelvic infection
• Undiagnosed genital tract bleeding
• suspected pregnancy
• severe dysmenorrhea
• sTIs — current or recurrent
• wilson disease and copper allergy, for copper-containing IUCDs
• Breast cancer, for hormone-containing IUCDs The different types of IUCD are shown below:






The timing of insertion of IUCD is as follows:
• Interval insertion (inter-conceptional period)- preferable to insert 2–3 days after menstruation, but it can be inserted at any time during the cycle. It can also be inserted during
menstruation which has certain advantages like an open cervical canal and a distended uterine cavity
• post-partum insertion is done at least 6 weeks after delivery when the uterus involutes to the normal size
• postplacental insertion can be done immediately following delivery of the placenta
• Inserted within 5 days of coitus as an effective method of emergency contraception (Eg: incase of ruptured condom during intercourse)",6135-3824.PNG,B,6148-3830.PNG;6148-3829.PNG
Q7,A 2o-year-old woman is evaluated for primary infertility. Hysterosalpingography was done and reveals the finding shown below. what is the anomaly seen in the image?,"a)septate uterus
b)uterine didelphys
c)Bicornuate uterus
d)unicornuate uterus","The anomaly seen in the given hysterosalpingogram is suggestive of a septate uterus.
A septate uterus is characterized by the presence of a septum in the endometrial cavity due to the  failure of the medial segments of the Müllerian ducts to regress. This creates a permanent septum within the uterine cavity. The septum can project partially from the fundus or can extend
completely to the cervical os. on HSG, the septate uterus is seen as widely diverging horns with an intercornual angle &lt;75 degrees.
HSG provides information about the interior of the uterine cavity and not the exterior. Therefore, it cannot reliably differentiate between a septate uterus and a bicornuate uterus. A septate uterus  has a smooth fundal contour whereas a bicornuate uterus has an indented fundus.
Transvaginal 3-D ultrasonography (3D TV USG) helps to differentiate between the bicornuate
uterus and a septate uterus and is recommended for the assessment of patients with a suspected  uterine anomaly. MRI is an accurate investigation to diagnose the septate uterus. Hysteroscopy    combined with laparoscopy can confirm both the internal and the external contour of the uterus.
Hysteroscopic septoplasty is a preferred treatment option for the septate uterus. It refers to the resection of the uterine septum under hysteroscopic guidance. There is a reduced risk of pelvic  adhesions, scarring and the necessity of cesarean sections for future pregnancies with the
hysteroscopic approach, compared with transabdominal approaches.",6135-3823.PNG,A,
Q8,"A pregnant woman with no other comorbid conditions develops preeclampsia. she enquires about the cause of her condition. The doctor explains that it is due to the failure of the
invasion of:","a)spiral artery by villous trophoblasts
b)Radial artery by cytotrophoblasts
c)spiral artery by extravillous trophoblasts
d)Arcuate artery by extravillous trophoblasts","preeclampsia occurs due to the failure of the invasion of extravillous trophoblasts into the spiral artery.
The spiral artery supplies blood to the endometrium. In normal pregnancy, there is an invasion of the extravillous trophoblasts (specifically, endovascular trophoblasts) into the walls of the spiral     arteries. In the first wave of invasion (1o–12 weeks), endovascular trophoblasts invade up to
decidual segments. In the second wave (16–18 weeks), they invade up to the myometrial segments.
This vascular remodeling process replaces the endothelial lining and the muscular arterial wall with endovascular trophoblasts. This results in the distension of the spiral arterioles, thereby    transforming them into a low resistance, low pressure, and high flow system.
In preeclampsia, the failure of the second wave of endovascular trophoblastic invasion into uterine vessels leads to decreased placental perfusion.
The images below show the sequential branching of the uterine artery and the vascular
remodeling in preeclampsia respectively,






Other contributory etiological factors include genetic factors and maladaptive responses to fetal antigens and cardiovascular changes in pregnancy.
The basic pathology in preeclampsia is endothelial dysfunction leading to decreased nitric oxide production and vascular spasm. This leads to ischemic changes that result in necrosis,
hemorrhage, and end-organ damage.
changes leading to vasospasm and endothelial dysfunction include:
• Reduced vasodilatory prostaglandin PGI2 and increased vasoconstrictor thromboxane (TXA2)
• Reduced angiotensinase activity and increased sensitivity of vessels to angiotensin II, which is a vasopressor
• Increased production of endothelin 1, a potent vasoconstrictor
• Increased inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor- α , interleukins) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing endothelial injury



• Increased antiangiogenic factors like soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase I (SFlt-1) and soluble endoglin (sEng)
The definitive treatment of pre-eclampsia is the termination of pregnancy at ≥37 weeks.",,C,6150-3832.PNG;6150-3831.PNG
Q9,"A woman with an obstetric score of G2p1 comes to the clinic at 14 weeks of gestation for her antenatal checkup. A uterine artery doppler was suggested by the doctor. what would it
detect?","a)Early-onset preeclampsia
b)Late-onset preeclampsia
c)Fetal growth restriction
d)placenta accreta","A uterine artery doppler would detect early-onset preeclampsia.
The development of a diastolic notch and resistance to flow in the uterine artery doppler suggests  the development of gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and fetal growth restriction later in     the pregnancy. A high resistance index in the second trimester is associated with a sixfold increase in the incidence of preeclampsia. The trophoblastic invasion of maternal uterine vessels in the
first half of pregnancy results in a decrease in vascular resistance. This can be detected by Doppler studies.
other screening tests which can be used for the prediction of pre-eclampsia include:
• Mean arterial pressure ≥9o mm Hg in the second trimester
• Absence of end-diastolic frequencies in umbilical artery doppler
• Roll over test
preeclampsia is a multi-system disorder marked by blood pressure ≥14o/9o mm Hg with
proteinuria after the 2oth week of gestation in a previously normotensive and non-proteinuric
woman. usually, there is an invasion of the extravillous trophoblasts (specifically, endovascular    trophoblasts) into the walls of the spiral arteries. In the first trimester, the trophoblastic invasion up to the decidual segments occurs. The myometrial segments are invaded in the second
trimester. This second wave of endovascular trophoblast migration fails to happen in
preeclampsia.
The pathogenesis can be explained by an imbalance in the prostaglandins - a deficiency of pGI2 (vasodilator) and increased thromboxane (vasoconstrictor). The deficiency of nitric oxide and      elevated antiangiogenic factors are other mechanisms responsible.
Features include headache, visual disturbances, epigastric pain, and thrombocytopenia. Risk
factors include young maternal age, nulliparity, metabolic syndrome, and hyperhomocysteinemia. other options:
option B: Late-onset preeclampsia occurs &gt; 34 weeks. It often has a favorable outcome.
option C: Fetal growth restriction can be detected by abnormal uterine artery Doppler notching at 2o-24 weeks of gestation.
option D: placenta accreta or morbidly adherent placenta arises due to partial or total absence of decidua basalis. Sonography is recommended for diagnosis. Better results can be obtained with     power doppler.",,A,
Q10,"while conducting a delivery, you perform the maneuver shown below. Following this, there is incomplete separation of the placenta and massive hemorrhage. what is your next step in
management?","a)start oxytocin infusion and wait for spontaneous delivery of placenta
b)uterine massage
c)Arrange for blood and use crede's method for placental delivery
d)Manual removal of placenta","The maneuver shown is the Brandt-Andrews maneuver used in controlled cord traction for
delivery of the placenta. The clinical features point to a diagnosis of primary postpartum
hemorrhage due to retained tissues and the next step in management is manual removal of the placenta.
Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is defined as blood loss &gt;5oo mL following the birth of the baby. It is of two types:
• Primary PPH: It occurs within 24 hours after the birth of the baby. This is again classified into third-stage hemorrhage (bleeding before placental expulsion) and true postpartum hemorrhage  (bleeding after placental separation).
• secondary PPH: It occurs after 24 hours but within the puerperal period.
The four main causes of primary PPH are atonic uterus, trauma, retained tissues, and
coagulopathies.
Retained tissues such as placental bits and blood clots lead to imperfect uterine retraction. Causes for delayed placental delivery include simple adherent placenta, lower uterine segment
constriction, and morbidly adherent placenta. In the presence of brisk bleeding and partial or   total attachment of the placenta, manual removal is indicated. It is carried out under adequate analgesia and aseptic precautions.
If the placenta is not expelled even after 3o minutes following the birth of the baby, it is known as retained placenta.  It can lead to hemorrhage, shock, and puerperal sepsis. unseparated retained   placenta is manually removed under general anesthesia.",6137-3825.PNG,D,
Q11,"A female patient collapses soon after delivery. There is profuse bleeding and features of
disseminated intravascular coagulation. which of the following is the most likely etiology?","a)Amniotic fluid embolism
b)postpartum hemorrhage
c)peripartum cardiomyopathy
d)Rupture of the uterus","The given clinical scenario with a diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) points to amniotic fluid embolism as the most likely etiology.
Amniotic fluid embolism presents with a classic triad of hemodynamic and respiratory
compromise, along with DIC. usually, it presents during the late stages of labor or immediate postpartum. Gasping for air, seizures, and cardiorespiratory arrest are other features. Clinical features are variable.
Diagnostic criteria for amniotic fluid embolism include:
• sudden onset cardiorespiratory arrest, or both hypotension and respiratory compromise
• overt DIC
• onset during labor or within 3o minutes of delivery of the placenta
• No fever ≥38°C
since there are no specific diagnostic tests, a clinical diagnosis has to be made. other causes for a similar presentation such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and anaphylactic shock needs to be ruled out.
Risk factors include rapid labor, meconium-stained liquor, and uterine tears. Post-term
pregnancy, maternal age, and eclampsia are other predisposing conditions. The currently accepted mechanism is the entry of fetal material into the maternal circulation which leads to the activation



of proinflammatory mediator systems. This results in pulmonary vasoconstriction and
hypertension. The tissue factor present in fetal material also activates factor VII resulting in DIC.
The condition can be fatal and management includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation and advanced cardiac life support.
other options:
option B: post-partum hemorrhage is the loss of ≥5oomL of blood after the third stage of labor. symptoms and signs of hypovolemia are commonly seen.
option C: peripartum cardiomyopathy presents with features of heart failure in the last month of   pregnancy or within 5 months of delivery. probable causes include viral myocarditis, malnutrition, and hormonal interactions.
option D: Rupture of the uterus is a disruption in the continuity of all the uterine layers anytime    after 28 weeks of pregnancy. Clinical features depend on the specific cause and include abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, fainting attacks, and rapid pulse rate.",,A,
Q12,"You are examining a multigravida in the second stage of labor for the past two hours. on
examination, contractions are adequate, the cervix is dilated with the head at station o with     molding 2+ and caput 2+. The sagittal suture is in the right occipitotransverse position. The    fetal heart rate is 14o beats/minute. which of the following is carried out for the management of this patient?","a)Midpelvic forceps
b)vacuum-assisted delivery
c)wait for an hour for spontaneous labor
d)Lower segment cesarean section","The given clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of deep transverse arrest. A lower segment cesarean section is carried out for the management of this patient.
In deep transverse arrest, the sagittal suture is placed in the transverse bispinous diameter. There is no descent of the head for at least 1/2-1 hour after full dilatation of the cervix. The mode of
delivery is based on the fetal condition and pelvic assessment. Caput succedaneum indicates the     static position of the head for a prolonged duration. Molding occurs due to the passage of the fetal head through a resistant birth passage. Grade 2 molding indicates overlapping parietal bones
which can be separated easily. The presence of caput and molding of grade 2+ indicates a cephalopelvic disproportion. In such cases, a cesarean section has to be performed.
If the pelvis is adequate, application of ventouse or manual rotation and forceps application can be tried.
Deep transverse arrest, can be either due to incomplete forward rotation of the oblique
occipitoposterior position or due to nonrotation in the occipitotransverse position.
occipitoposterior position is an abnormal position of the vertex and can undergo normal labor in favorable circumstances. In some cases, it undergoes non-rotation resulting in oblique posterior   arrest. If it undergoes malrotation (anterior rotation of the sinciput), it can cause a persistent
occipitoposterior position. spontaneous delivery can occur as face to pubis. If arrest occurs in this position, it is termed as occipitosacral arrest. Incomplete forward rotation, as described above,
leads to a deep transverse arrest.
Features of occipitoposterior position include infra-umbilical flattening and fetal heart sounds localized to the flank. The fetal parts are more prominently felt near the midline.",,D,
Q13,A primigravida presents to the labor room at 4o weeks of gestation with lower abdominal pain. she has been in labor for 3 hours. which of the following will determine if she is in  active labor?,"a)Fetal head 5/5 palpable on abdominal examination
b)Two contractions lasting for 1o seconds in 1o minutes
c)More than 5 cm cervical dilatation with complete effacement
d)Rupture of membranes","This patient will have presented in active labor if she had more than 5 cm cervical dilatation with complete effacement
The first stage of labor is characterized by dilatation and effacement of the cervix and can be  divided into latent phase and active labor. The onset of latent labor is the point at which the  mother perceives regular contractions. cervical dilatation of ≥5 cm in the presence of uterine contractions can be taken to reliably represent the threshold for active labor.
The first symptom to appear is intermittent painful uterine contractions followed by the expulsion of blood-stained mucus (show) per vagina. In the late first stage, the contraction comes at
intervals of 3–5 minutes and lasts 45 seconds.
The second stage of labor begins with complete cervical dilatation and ends with fetal delivery. The third stage of labor is characterized by the delivery of the placenta.
The fourth stage is a stage of observation for at least an hour after the full expulsion of the placenta.
Fetal head 5/5 on abdominal examination, signifies the degree of descent in relation to the pelvic inlet and denotes the head is floating above the brim.
Rupture of membranes at or near term signifies the labor is likely to begin soon.
More than 12 uterine contractions in 1 hour may signify labor onset. partograph is charted every half an hour recording the number of contractions in 1o minutes and the duration of each
contraction in seconds. contractions can be classified as mild (contraction duration less than 2o seconds), moderate(between 2o and 4o seconds), and strong (more than 4o seconds).",,C,
Q14,Identify the blue-colored area shown in the image below.,"a)obstetric outlet
b)Anatomical outlet
c)pelvic inlet
d)Midpelvis","The blue colored area in the given image shows midpelvis.
Midpelvis is the region of the pelvis that is bounded by the plane of the greatest pelvic dimensions above and the midpelvic plane below.
The plane of greatest pelvic dimensions (most roomy pelvic plane) extends from the middle of the posterior surface of the symphysis pubis to the junction of the second and third sacral vertebrae.
The midpelvic plane extends from the lower margin of the symphysis pubis to the tip of the
sacrum at the level of ischial spines (coinciding with the plane of least pelvic dimensions), or from the lower margin of the symphysis pubis to the junction of S4 and S5, making a wedge posteriorly.





other options:
option A: obstetric outlet - It is the region of the pelvis that is bounded by the plane of the least pelvic dimensions above and the anatomical outlet below.


option B: Anatomical outlet/ bony outlet - It corresponds to the bony outer margin of the pelvis. It is a diamond-shaped region formed by joining two triangular planes with a common base. The
anterior triangle is bounded laterally by the ischiopubic rami and the apex is formed by the inferior border of the pubic arch. The posterior triangle is bounded laterally by the ischial    tuberosity and sacrotuberous ligament and the apex is formed by the tip of the coccyx. The  common base is formed by the line joining the ischial tuberosities.





option C: pelvic inlet - It represents the superior plane of the true pelvis. It is bounded by the    horizontal pubic rami and the symphysis pubis anteriorly, the linea terminalis laterally, and the promontory and alae of the sacrum posteriorly.",6138-3826.PNG,D,6155-3834.PNG;6155-3833.PNG;6156-3835.PNG;6156-3836.PNG
Q15,what will be the level ofthe uterus on the postpartum day 2?,"a)Two finger breadths below umbilicus
b)one finger breadth below umbilicus
c)Three finger breadths below umbilicus
d)Four finger breadths below umbilicus","on the second day post-delivery, the level of the uterus lies at two finger breadths below the umbilicus.
24 hours post delivery is equal to Day o when uterus is just below the umbilicus.
Day 1 - 1 finger breadth below umbilicus
Day 2 - 2 fingers breadth below umbilicus



The rate of involution of the uterus can be clinically assessed by noting the fundal height of the uterus in relation to the symphysis pubis.
Involution of the uterus occurs due to a decrease in the size of muscle fibers. Following delivery, the fundus lies about 5 1/2 inches above the symphysis pubis. During the first 24 hours, the level remains constant, after which there is a steady decrease in height by half an inch in 24
hours, which approximately equals two finger breadth below the umbilicus on second-day post     delivery. By the end of 2nd week, the uterus becomes a pelvic organ. The rate of involution slows down after this until 6 weeks. The uterus almost becomes normal in size by 6 weeks.
Involution of the uterus occurs due to a decrease in the size of muscle fibers.

Q16,A primigravida woman at 12 weeks of gestation comes to the antenatal clinic for nutritional advice. which of the following will you recommend?,"a)Additional 3ookcal in 2nd trimester
b)Additional 3ookcal in 1st trimester
c)Additional 4ookcal in 3rd trimester
d)Additional 3ookcal throughout the pregnancy","For a pregnant woman, an additional 3ookcal in the 2nd trimester is recommended.
According to williams obstetrics, in the first trimester, energy requirements are generally
the same as non-pregnant women. In the second trimester, it increases by 34o kcal and in
the third, it increases by 452 kcal per day. According to IcMR (Indian council of Medical
Research), an additional intake of 3oo kcal during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy is recommended. Therefore, option A would be a better answer in this case.
pregnancy is a period where a mother will require additional nutritional requirements to support  the healthy growth and development of the fetus. According to the National Institute of Nutrition,
• protein intake should increase by 23g per day compared to non-pregnant women
• Fat intake should be 3og per day
• calcium intake should be 12oomg per day
• Iron intake should be 35mg per day



During lactation, IcMR recommends increasing 55o kcal during the first six months of lactation and 4oo kcal during 7- 12 months of lactation.",,A,
Q17,"A 4o-year-old G2p1 woman with 18 weeks of amenorrhea comes with a dilated cervix. The  cervical length is 15 mm. In spite of explaining the risks, she insisted on cerclage. which of the following is a contraindication for cervical cerclage?","a)Ruptured membranes
b)prolapse of membranes into the vagina
c)Fetal fibronectin positive
d)Advanced maternal age","The clinical scenario of mid-trimester cervical dilatation and a short cervix suggests cervical incompetence. Ruptured membranes is a contraindication for cervical cerclage.
cervical incompetence or insufficiency is a functional or anatomical impairment in the retentive power of the cervix (or internal os). It is characterized
by repeated, mid-trimester painless cervical dilatation. It leads to the escape of amniotic fluid followed by painless expulsion of the products of conception.
cerclage is the procedure done to strengthen the cervix in patients with cervical
incompetence. contraindications of cervical cerclage include:
• Ruptured membranes
• Intrauterine infection
• uterine contractions
• vaginal bleeding
• cervical dilatation &gt;4 cm
• Fetal death or defect
cervical incompetence is associated with various risk factors such as prior preterm
birth, congenital uterine anomalies, iatrogenic (dilatation and curettage, induced abortion by
dilatation and evacuation, vaginal operative delivery through an undilated cervix, amputation of the cervix, etc), and multiple gestations.
In the interconceptional period, diagnosis is made with the passage of number 6-8 Hegar's dilator beyond the internal os without resistance or pain. Investigations for cervical incompetence during pregnancy include:
• per speculum examination - shows cervical dilatation with herniation of membranes
• Transvaginal ultrasound - funneling of internal os &gt;1 cm and cervical length &lt;25 mm     prophylactic cervical cerclage is done between 12-14 weeks of gestation. Rescue or emergency cerclage is done when there is bulging or prolapse of membranes through a dilated cervix.
shirodkar and McDonald's methods of cervical cerclage are the commonly performed cerclage
procedures during pregnancy. In McDonald's method, a non-absorbable (mersilene) suture
material is placed as a purse-string suture at the level of the internal os, whereas in the shirodkar method, non-absorbable (mersilene) tape is used. Removal of stitch should be done at the 37th      week of gestation. It can be removed earlier in case of preterm labor or if signs of abortion are
seen. Laparoscopic abdominal cerclage is used for non-pregnant patients.
other options:
option c- Fetal fibronectin in cervicovaginal secretions is a marker for impending preterm labor    before membrane rupture. prophylactic cervical cerclage is indicated in women if ultrasonography



confirms cervical incompetence.
option D- Advanced maternal age is not a contraindication for cervical cerclage.",,A,
Q18,"A primigravida presents to the emergency room in the early stage of labor with adequate
uterine contractions. on per vaginal examination, a gynecoid pelvis is felt, the membranes are ruptured, and the vertex is felt in the right occipito-posterior position. How will you manage    this patient?","a)vacuum-assisted delivery
b)cesarean section
c)Normal vaginal delivery
d)Forceps delivery","The given features of right occipito-posterior presentation with the favorable pelvis (gynecoid) and adequate uterine contractions can be managed by normal vaginal delivery.
Right occipito-posterior position (RoP) is the most common malposition, which occurs when the occiput is situated posteriorly over the sacroiliac joint, or directly over the sacrum. It is
associated with the risk of delayed engagement of the head, prolonged labor due to transverse arrest, and the need for cesarean sections.
Features of occipito-posterior position include infra-umbilical flattening and fetal heart sounds
localized to the flank. The fetal parts are more prominently felt near the midline. The head
engages through the right oblique diameter in RoP and the engaging AP diameter is
occipitofrontal or suboccipito-frontal. In 9o% of circumstances with a favorable pelvis and strong uterine contractions without any complications, it undergoes the mechanism like that of normal   labor. Hence, we can wait and watch for the progress of normal vaginal delivery.
In some cases, it undergoes non-rotation resulting in oblique posterior arrest. If it
undergoes malrotation (anterior rotation of the sinciput), it can cause a persistent
occipito-posterior position. spontaneous delivery can occur as face to pubis. If an arrest occurs in this position, it is termed an occipito-sacral arrest. Incomplete forward rotation leads to a deep
transverse arrest.
Indications of cesarean section in occipito-posterior position include the arrest of labor,
inadequate uterine contractions, fetal distress, and other obstetrical complications.
During the second stage of labor, if the anterior rotation of the occiput is completed, delivery occurs spontaneously or may require the application of ventouse or low forceps.",,C,
Q19,"A pregnant patient, with a history of classical cesarean section in view of fetal growth   retardation in the previous pregnancy, presents to you. She is currently at 35 weeks of gestation with breech presentation. what is the next step in management?","a)cesarean section at 37 weeks
b)Advice USG and visit after 2 weeks
c)Internal podalic version followed by vaginal delivery
d)External cephalic version at 36 weeks","The next step in the management of this pregnancy with breech presentation and a history of previous classical cesarean delivery is a cesarean section at 37 weeks.
A classical casarean section is done by a longitudinal uterine incision. A previous classical
cesarean section is considered a high-risk factor for failure of VBAC (vaginal birth after previous cesarean). Hence, it is contraindicated. There is increased risk of uterine rupture (2-9%) in such cases. In some women, classical cesarean scar can even rupture several weeks before term.
other contraindications for VBAC include:
• ≥2 previous lower segment cesarean section
• Contracted pelvis or cephalo-pelvic disproportion
• other obstetric or medical complications



• prior uterine rupture
If the fetal buttocks or legs enters the pelvis before the head, the presentation is known as breech. Vaginal delivery of a singleton breech fetus can be considered. It can be spontaneous breech
delivery, partial breech extraction, or total breech extraction. However, cesarean delivery is     considered in the presence of any associated obstetric (previous cesarean delivery) of medical complications.
other options:
option B: An ultrasound will not change the decision regarding mode of delivery.
option C: Internal podalic version results in a breech presentation. It is done in case of transverse lie of second baby in twin pregnancy. It is not indicated in singleton pregnancy.
option D: External cephalic version is a manipulation through the abdominal wall that results in cephalic presentation. It is usally done at 37 weeks as it can revert back to breech position if
carried out before. However, it is contraindicated when vaginal delivery is not an option and in cases of previous cesarean delivery such as in this case.",,A,
Q20,"A primigravida at 22 weeks of gestation presents to you with profuse vaginal bleeding. Her
blood pressure and glucose levels are within normal limits. placental implantation at which of the following sites can cause this?","a)Internal os
b)Fallopian tube
c)ovarian
d)Abdominal","The given clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of placenta previa which is caused due to placental implantation at the internal os.
placenta previa is used to describe a placenta implanted in the lower uterine segment. painless bleeding towards the end of the second trimester or later is characteristic of the condition. It     usually occurs without warning and resolves spontaneously only to recur.
There are four types of placenta previa according to the degree of placental expansion to the lower uterine segment.
• Type-I: The lower margin of the placenta reaches the lower uterine segment but not the os.
• Type-II: The placenta does not cover the internal os but reaches its margin.
• Type-III: The placenta covers the closed internal os but does not do so when fully dilated.
• Type-IV: The placenta covers the internal os even when fully dilated.





predisposing factors include maternal age, multiparity, smoking, and leiomyomas. previous
cesarean deliveries, raised maternal alpha-fetoprotein levels, and assisted reproductive technology also increase the risk for placenta previa.
Management is individualized on a case-to-case basis. If there is no active bleeding during early
gestation, close observation is recommended. Elective cesarean section is usually carried out at 38 weeks. complications of placenta previa include primary postpartum hemorrhage, morbidly
adherent placenta, and coagulation defects.",,A,6161-3837.PNG
Q21,"A female patient presents to you with six weeks of amenorrhea, associated with abdominal
pain and vaginal bleeding with normal blood pressure. Investigations revealed beta-hcG to be 14oo mIU/mL. An ultrasound scan was done which showed a trilaminar endometrium with     normal adnexa. what is the next best step in the management of this patient?","a)Repeat beta-hcG after 48 hours
b)Repeat ultrasound after 3 days
c)Measurement of progesterone
d)Laparoscopy","The given clinical vignette points to the possibility of diagnosis of either an abortion or ectopic pregnancy. The next best step in the management of this patient is to repeat beta-hcG after 48 hours for diagnosis.
The causes of bleeding in early pregnancy include abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and hydatidiform   mole. The characteristic ultrasound finding of a molar pregnancy is snowstorm appearance and so it can be excluded.
A transvaginal ultrasound is done initially in such presentations to locate the gestational sac. If neither intrauterine nor extrauterine pregnancy can be confirmed, it is termed pregnancy of
unknown location till definite diagnosis.
A cut-off of ≥15oo mIU/mL for β-hcG levels, known as the discriminatory level is used to aid in  diagnosis. serial monitoring of hcG can be used to assess fetal well-being in cases of threatened abortion. If the initial level is below this cut-off, the gestational sac location usually cannot be
identified. In such situations, serial β-hcG levels are measured, and the pattern is assessed. If the value is above the discriminatory level, and an intrauterine pregnancy or abortion cannot be
confirmed, then ectopic pregnancy has to be suspected.
The doubling time of hcG during early pregnancy is 1.4-2 days. Failure to double the hcG value along with an empty uterus at 48 hours is highly suggestive of ectopic pregnancy. A trilaminar



endometrial pattern can be seen in ectopic pregnancy along with an adnexal mass separate from the ovary.
once the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is confirmed, administration of methotrexate in single or  multiple doses can be considered. A dilatation and curettage can be used to confirm the diagnosis.
other options:
option c: Measurement of progesterone cannot be used as a reliable diagnostic test. In general, values &lt;5ng/mL point to a nonliving intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy.
option D: Laparoscopy is the surgery of choice in hemodynamically stable patients for ectopic pregnancy.",,A,
Q22,"A 24-year-old lactating female with an 18-month-old child comes with a history of irregular, heavy bleeding seeking contraceptive advice. which is the contraceptive of choice?","a)progestasert
b)copper-T 38OA
c)Mala N
d)Norethisterone enanthate - depot injection","Among the given options, the contraceptive of choice in this lactating mother with heavy irregular bleeding is MALA N.
MALA N is a combined oral contraceptive (coc) that contains ethinyloestradiol (EE2) in a dose of 2o–3o mcg and o.15 mg of Levonorgesterol. It acts by suppressing ovulation by suppression of
pituitary hormones FsH AND LH.
coc has the lowest failure rates and helps in controlling polymenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and
menorrhagia. The risk of thromboembolism is established during the first 6 weeks postpartum
(puerperal period) with coc and they are known to suppress lactation. In this clinical scenario,
since the child is 18 months old (complementary feeds are usually started at 6 months and child is not entirely dependant on breastmilk for nutrition) and the woman is way past the puerperal
period, it can be safely administered.
other options:
option A: progestasert is a hormone-containing IUcD that acts by forming a thick mucus plug at the cervix and prevents the entry of sperms. Its usage is limited in cases with heavy unexplained  bleeding.
option B: copper T is not used in this patient as it might worsen the symptoms of menorrhagia and may result in anemia.
option D: Norethisterone enanthate depot is an intramuscular injection given once in 2 months. Though it is suitable for lactating women, it has an increased risk of menstrual irregularity and   osteopenia and so not preferred in this case.",,C,
Q23,"A 25-year-old male patient is evaluated for primary infertility. semen analysis shows
azoospermia. A testicular biopsy is done and the image is shown below. The shown finding is consistent with","a)sertoli cell only syndrome
b)Testicular atrophy
c)Benign testicular neoplasm
d)orchitis","The given clinical scenario and the biopsy findings are consistent with the diagnosis of sertoli cell-only syndrome.
patients with sertoli cell-only syndrome typically present between the age of 2o to 4o years with complaints of primary infertility. Diagnosis can be made on testicular biopsy findings. The
histopathology of the biopsy specimen typically shows the tubules which are populated by only



sertoli cells, with a thickening of the tubular basement membrane and absence of germ cells which is characteristic of sertoli cell-only syndrome.


The below image shows normal histology of testis:


The sertoli cells line the seminiferous tubules and have receptors for follicle-stimulating hormone (FsH) and testosterone. There are four sperms per sertoli cell. It produces a testosterone-binding  protein that maintains a high level of testosterone within the testis which is necessary for
continuous spermatogenesis.
In sertoli cell-only syndrome, only sertoli cells line the seminiferous tubules of the testis, and the patients have very low or absent spermatogenesis. There is no feedback inhibition due to absent   spermatozoa, which results in increased FsH levels, but testosterone levels and LH levels
remain unaffected since Leydig cells are not affected.
physical examination is normal as this condition presents with infertility without sexual
abnormality. Most cases are usually multifactorial and idiopathic. patients can still reproduce



with assisted reproductive technology.
other options:
option B: Testicular atrophy may be characterized by marked hyalinization and thickening of the basement membrane of the spermatic tubules with the absence of spermatids or germ cells. It
may occur due to cryptorchidism, atherosclerotic changes of the supplying vessels, cachexia, and end stage of inflammatory orchitis.
option c: sex cord-stromal cells are benign and include sertoli cell tumors and Leydig cell tumors. Leydig cells are characterized by the presence of crystalloids of Reinke.
option D: orchitis is characterized by the inflammatory infiltration of neutrophils and may progress to the formation of a frank abscess. The end-stage may lead to atrophic changes.",6141-3827.PNG,A,6163-3839.PNG;6163-3838.PNG
Q24,"A 2O-year-old woman presented at 7 weeks of gestation, unwilling to continue the pregnancy. what are the drugs used for medical termination of pregnancy in this patient?","a)Misoprostol and Medroxyprogesterone
b)Misoprostol and Mifepristone
c)Mifepristone and Methotextrate
d)Mifepristone and Medroxyprogesterone","The drugs used for medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) in this patient presenting at 7 weeks of gestation are misoprostol and mifepristone.
Mifepristone 2oomg is administered orally on day 1. The minimum recommended interval between mifepristone &amp; misoprostol is 24 hours.
24- 48 hours later, misoprostol 8oo mcg is administered by the vaginal, sublingual, or buccal route. clinical confirmation of MTP is done on day 14.
The various methods of termination of pregnancy are:
Misoprostol and Methotrexate regimen can also be used but takes a longer time of action.
The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Amendment Bill, 2o2o has extended the period of
termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks for special categories of women, including survivors  of rape, victims of incest, and other vulnerable women (like differently-abled women, minors). The upper gestation limit is not applicable in cases of substantial fetal abnormalities.

Q25,Testosterone helps in the development of various organs in the fetus. which of the following stimulates its production?,"a)LH from maternal pituitary
b)hcG from placenta
c)Inhibin from corpus luteum
d)GnRH from fetal hypothalamus","hcG (human chorionic gonadotropin) from placenta stimulates the production of testosterone in the male fetus.
hcG released from the placenta is the initial stimulus for testosterone production in the male    fetus. Later by the eighth week of gestation, fetal pituitary LH (luteinizing hormone) stimulates the Leydig cells of the testes to produce testosterone.
Sex differentiation of the embryo depends on the Y chromosome, which contains the
testis-determining gene called the SRY (sex-determining region on Y) gene. In a genetically male embryo (46, XY), the gonad is converted into testis under the influence of this gene. Female
development occurs in the absence of this gene.
Testosterone released from the Leydig cells acts on the wolffian duct to develop vas deferens,   epididymis, and seminal vesicles. Testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) with the help of 5-alpha-reductase which helps in the differentiation of male external genitalia.
The Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules of testes secrete antimüllerian hormone
(AMH)/Müllerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) by 7 weeks of gestation. It causes regression of the Mullerian duct and prevents the development of the uterus, fallopian tube, and upper vagina.
other options:
option A: It is LH from the fetal pituitary, and not the maternal pituitary that stimulates testosterone production in the male fetus.
option c: Inhibin A is produced by the corpus luteum and inhibin B is produced by the granulosa cells of the ovary. They inhibit FSH secretion.",,B,
