"Q1","A patient is undergoing modified radical neck dissection (MRND) for laryngeal malignancy.    while ligating the internal jugular vein, his etco2 dropped from 4o mmHg to 14 mmHg, and the patient developed hypotension along with cardiac arrhythmia. which of the following is    the most likely cause?","a)sympathetic overactivity
b)vagal stimulation
c)venous air embolism
d)carotid body stimulation","A drastic fall in etco2 with hypotension during neck surgery is most likely due to venous air embolism (VAE).
In modified radical neck dissection (MRND), a head-up position is given to provide a bloodless   surgical field. VAE into severed vessels is likely to occur when the surgical site is above the right atrium and venous pressure at the incision site is below the atmospheric pressure. pulmonary     artery pressure will rise and etco2 will fall after a venous air embolism.
In sympathetic overactivity and carotid body stimulation, blood pressure will rise.
In vagal stimulation, a drastic drop in etco2 is unlikely.","","C",""
"Q2","At what level does the spinal cord end in adults?","a)L3-L4
b)L1-L2
c)T12-L1
d)L2-L3","The distal termination of the spinal cord is the lower border of L1 in adults.
Because the spinal cord ends at L1, lower nerve roots course some distance before exiting the intervertebral foramina. These lower spinal nerves form the cauda equina.
Note:
In children, the spinal cord ends at L3 and moves up with age.","","B",""
"Q3","which of the following is not a contraindication to the use of morphine?","a)Bronchial asthma
b)Renal failure
c)Emphysema
d)Acute myocardial infarction","Acute myocardial infarction is not a contraindication for morphine use.
Morphine is the opioid of choice for myocardial infarction as it relieves anxiety, chest pain, and myocardial oxygen demand.
contraindications to the use of Morphine:
• Bronchial asthma: Histamine release can cause bronchoconstriction and precipitate attacks of asthma.
• Renal failure: Morphine-6-glucuronide (metabolite) can accumulate and lead to prolonged respiratory depression.
• Emphysema: Respiratory depression and decreased response to hypoxia can cause hypercapnia in patients with coPD
• Head injury: Hypercapnia due to respiratory depression can increase IcP. Miosis, vomiting, and effect on wakefulness make interpreting the signs of head injury difficult.
• Biliary colic: constriction of sphincter of oddi can worsen biliary spasm
• Hypotension and shock","","D",""
"Q4","cardiac output can be determined using the following except?","a)Thermal dilution technique
b)capnography
c)Esophageal doppler
d)Echocardiography","capnography is a measurement of end-tidal co2, which is used to confirm tracheal intubation and assess ventilation in the perioperative period.
cardiac output measurements technique:
• Thermodilution
• Dye dilution, using indocyanine green
• Lithium dilution
• Pulse contour devices
• Esophageal doppler
• Thoracic bioimpedance
• Echocardiography
Note: Thermal dilution method uses a non-toxic liquid of temperature different from the blood. This fluid is injected into a vein and is detected on the arterial side using a catheter with a
temperature sensor. The rate of flow of this liquid is used to calculate the cardiac output.","","B",""
