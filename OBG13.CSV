Q1,"A lady on oral contraceptive pills presented with white discharge per vaginum. It is not
associated with itching or foul smell and stains her underwear yellow in color. Examination of the discharge revealed normal lactobacilli and acidic pH. what is the most probable
diagnosis?","a)vaginal candidiasis
b)Increased normal vaginal discharge
c)Bacterial vaginosis
d)chlamydial infection","In the given clinical scenario history of vaginal discharge with no itching and foul smell along with normal lactobacilli count with acidic pH is suggestive of normal vaginal discharge.
Leucorrhea is defined as an excessive normal vaginal discharge.
The term leucorrhea should fulfil the following criteria:
• The excess secretion is evident from persistent vulval moistness or staining of the undergarments (brownish yellow on drying) or need to wear a vulval pad.
• It is nonpurulent and nonoffensive.
• It is nonirritant and never causes pruritus.
The physiologic basis involved in normal vaginal secretion is dependent on the endogenous estrogen level. with the rising estrogen level, there is abundant secretory activity of the
endocervical glands and the superficial vaginal epithelium becomes rich in glycogen
The normal secretion is expected to increase in conditions when the estrogen levels become high. such conditions are :



• During puberty—Increased levels of endogenous estrogen lead to marked overgrowth of the    endo- cervical epithelium which may encroach onto the ectocervix producing congenital ectopy (erosion) → increased secretion.
• During menstrual cycle
• Around ovulation-peak rise of estrogen → increase in secretory activity of the cervical glands.
• premenstrual pelvic congestion and increased mucus secretion from the hypertrophied endometrial glands.
• pregnancy-There is hyperestrinism with increased vascularity. This leads to increased vaginal transudate and cervical gland secretion.
• During sexual excitement, when there is an abundant secretion from the Bartholin’s glands.
other options:
vaginal candidiasis: This condition generally presents with itching and a white, ""cottage
cheese""-like discharge. The absence of itching and the nature of the discharge described in the scenario rule out this option.
Bacterial vaginosis: This condition is characterized by a thin, gray, foul-smelling discharge. The fact that the discharge in this case does not have a foul smell rules out this option.
chlamydial infection: chlamydia infections can cause a range of symptoms, including abnormal vaginal discharge. However, many individuals with chlamydia are asymptomatic, and the
discharge associated with this condition does not typically stain underwear yellow.",,B,
Q2,what is the most common cause of puberty menorrhagia?,"a)Anovulation
b)Endometriosis
c)Malignancy
d)Bleeding disorder","The most common cause of puberty menorrhagia is anovulatory cycles.
Anovulatory cycles → unopposed estrogen → endometrial hyperplasia → prolonged and heavy periods.
other causes
Endocrine dysfunction:
• polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos
• Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.
Hematological:
• Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
• von-willebrand’s disease  leukaemia.
pelvic tumors:
• Fibroid uterus
• sarcoma botryroides
• Estrogen producing ovarian tumor
pregnancy complications (abortion)



Treatment:
Reassurance and psychological support. Rest and correction of anemia is done.In refractory cases, progestogens, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone 5 mg thrice daily is given
till bleed- ing stops. usually, the bleeding is controlled within 3–7 days. Medication is continued  for 21 days. The condition usually becomes normal following 2–3 courses and then normal cycles resume. In emergency, conjugated equine estrogen 2o–4o mg IV is given every 6–8 hours. Once  the bleeding is controlled, combined oral pills are started.
Regular menstrual cycle will be established once the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis is matured.",,A,
Q3,sRy region is located in:,"a)short arm of y chromosome
b)short arm of X chromosome
c)Long arm of y chromosome
d)Long arm of X chromosome","SRY region is present on the short arm of the Y chromosome(Yp11).
SRY stands for the sex-determining region on Y. It contains the SRY gene, which produces the   protein called the testis determining factor. This causes the gonads to develop into the testes. If the SRY gene or Y chromosome is absent, the gonads develop as ovaries.",,A,
Q4,"A 32 year old female presents with grey-white vaginal discharge and on gram stain of the discharge, clue cells are seen. clue cells are","a)Degranulated neutrophils (pus)
b)Epithelial cells covered by bacteria
c)Gardenella vaginalis with Bacillin rods
d)Doderlein bacili in the macrophage","clue cells are epithelial cells with a fuzzy border or granular cytoplasm caused by small
gram-negative bacilli adhering on their surface is characteristic of bacterial vaginosis.
Bacterial vaginosis is a polymicrobial infection caused by Mobiluncus curtisii, Gardnerella
vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, and Haemophilus vaginalis. It has a malodorous (fishy smell) vaginal discharge with minimal vulval irritation.
Amsel's criteria is helpful in diagnosing bacterial vaginosis when 3 of the following 4 are present
• Thin, white homogenous vaginal discharge
• A pH of vaginal fluid &gt;4.5
• Fishy odor of discharge accentuated by adding 1o% KOH-whiff test
• presence of clue cells on microscopy.
Treatment is oral metronidazole 5oo mg BD for 7 days. Alternatively, Ampicillin 5oo mg or cephalosporin 5oo mg bid for 7 days is also effective.",,B,6202-3845.PNG;6202-3845-14.png

Q6,All the following can result in non-immune hydrops except,"a)ABO incompatibility
b)parvovirus B19
c)chromosomal defect
d)Alpha thalassemia major","ABo incompatibility is not a cause of nonimmune hydrops.
Hydrops is diagnosed by identifying two or more fetal effusions—pleural, pericardial, or

Q7,In a 46xY female complete gonadal dysgenesis was noted. complete gonadal dysgenesis is caused by what in the SRY gene?,"a)point mutation
b)Deletion of gene
c)Translocation
d)Inversion","Amongst the given options, a point mutation in the SRY gene is most likely to result in complete gonadal dysgenesis but this answer remains controversial as some other sources mention SRY
deletion is more commonly associated. The most common cause attributable to about 85% of cases is still idiopathic.
pure gonadal dysgenesis results from a point mutation in SRY/ SRY deletion or point mutations    in another gene with testis-determining effects (DAXJ, SF-1, cBX2). This leads to underdeveloped dysgenetic gonads that fail to produce androgens or AMH. This is characterized by a normal
prepubertal female phenotype and a normal mullerian system due to absent AMH.
The child usually presents with failure in the development of secondary sexual characteristics at   puberty and amenorrhea. Investigations reveal the absence of estrogen production and they have elevated levels of FSH (&gt;4o miu/mL) and low oestradiol levels (&lt;25 pg/mL).
women with streak ovaries are infertile, but they can bear children with oocyte donation. They must be treated with cyclic estrogen and progestogen to promote feminization and secondary    sexual characteristics and prevent osteoporosis.",,A,
Q8,which of the following statements about primary dysmennorhea is true?,"a)pain begins after few hours after onset of periods and can last up to 48 hours
b)It is dependent on psychological factors
c)pain begins 3 days prior to the onset of periods and is present upto the second day of the period
d)GnRH antagonists are the first line of treatment","primary dysmenorrhea is dependent on psychological factors is the true statement.
Dysmenorrhea is defined as cramping pain that occurs during menstruation.  Low social support, alexithymia, neuroticism trait, long menstrual bleeding, family history of dysmenorrhea, and
high-caffeine diet are important risk factors for women with primary dysmenorrhea. It can be classified as:



A. Etiological:
• primary dysmenorrhea is a type of dysmenorrhoea that is not associated with any pelvic
pathology. It affects women in the age group of 18 to 25 years, with ovulatory cycles. It begins just before or with the onset of menstruation. (Not a few hours after as in option A or not 3 days prior as in option C)
• secondary (Acquired) dysmenorrhea is associated with the presence of pelvic pathologies such as fibroids, adenomyosis, pelvic inflammatory disease (pID), and endometriosis.
B.  Clinical:
• spasmodic dysmenorrhea is the most common and is characterized by cramping pain on the first and second days of menstruation.
• Congestive dysmenorrhea presents as worsening pelvic discomfort and pelvic pain, a few days before the onset of menses followed by relief of the symptoms. This is seen in pID, IUCD users, varicosities of pelvic veins, pelvic endometriosis, and fibroids.
• Membranous dysmenorrhea is rare and is characterized by crampy pain that occurs with the passage of the endometrium as a cast at the time of menstruation.
primary dysmenorrhea can be managed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NsAIDs), combined oral contraceptive pills,(option D), and progestin-only pills. GnRH agonists and
androgens are also useful. surgical management includes hysterectomy and is indicated if not   responding to medical management. In secondary dysmenorrhea, treating the cause is needed.",,B,

years of thelarche or has not menstruated by age 14 and shows signs of hirsutism, excessive
exercise, or eating disorder. The conventional definition of primary amenorrhea is a failure of the onset of menstruation beyond 16 years of age or failure to attain seconday sexual characteristics    by 13 years of age.
secondary amenorrhea is absence of menstruation for 3 months in a female who was previously menstruating normally.
Causes of primary amenorrhea:
• Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
• Hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction

Q10,"A 38-year-old multi gravida presents with 2 years of infertility and dyspareunia and
dysmenorrhea. she has a retroverted uterus and tenderness in the pouch of Douglas. what would be the next step of management?","a)Diagnostic laparoscopy
b)Laparotomy
c)HsG
d)TVs","This patient presenting with symptoms of dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea with a retroverted
uterus and tenderness in the pouch of Douglas is most likely suffering from endometriosis. The next best step in management is to perform TVS. Laparoscopy is the gold standard for the
diagnosis of endometriosis but it is not done routinely for diagnostic purposes.
Endometriosis is a condition that is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue in ectopic sites such as:
• ovary (chocolate cysts- left/right lower quadrant pain)
• pouch of Douglas (pain during defecation)
• uterosacral ligaments (chronic pelvic pain &amp; infertility)
• Appendix (right lower quadrant pain)
• Lower segment cesarean section (LScS) scar endometriosis
• umbilicus
• Lung (cyclical hemoptysis)



These extra-uterine sites of endometrial tissue are influenced by cyclical changes in the hormone levels which give rise to location-specific symptoms as mentioned above.
Management:
Investigations include:
• UsG: TVs will show a chocolate cyst.
• MRI
• cA-125 more than 35 U/mL
• Laparoscopy: Gold standard for the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis. It is used to locate the sites, take a biopsy and surgically remove the deposits.
Drugs used for symptom control include the following:
• oral contraceptive pills
• Mirena IUD
• GnRH analogs
• Letrozole
surgical management includes:
Minimally invasive surgery may be used to destroy the tissue by cautery, laser vaporization, and lyse adhesions that have formed as a complication of endometriosis.
Major surgical measures include incision of chocolate cyst and removal of lining,
salpingo-oophorectomy, hysterectomy, and unilateral or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.",,D,
Q11,"A 23-year-old female with 6 years of infertility, has a BMI of 33 and facial hair. Investigations reveal she has (pcos) and spills from bilateral tubes. she and her husband are trying to
conceive, what would be the best plan of management for this lady?","a)weight loss + Metformin + induction of ovulation with urinary gonadotrophins
b)weight loss + folic acid, Try for spontaneous induction, if failed move to induction of ovulation
c)Metformin + finasteride + Induction of ovulation
d)weight loss + Metformin + Induction of ovulation with clomiphene","In the given clinical scenario the most appropriate management would be weight loss + folic acid, try for spontaneous induction, if failed move to induction of ovulation. In obese Pcos patients,    even modest weight loss (5% of body weight) can help in the restoration of ovulatory cycles in
some cases. Hence spontaneous induction is tried. Folic acid is normally administered as prophylaxis before conception to prevent neural tube defects.
Polycystic ovarian syndrome
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (Pcos)/ Polycystic ovarian disease (PcoD)/ stein-Leventhal
syndrome is a multisystem disorder. It involves metabolic and endocrine dysfunctions that
commonly occur among women in the reproductive age group. It has multifactorial causation, such as lifestyle changes, stress, diet, obesity, and hyperinsulinemic states.
Important clinical features of Pcos are Menstrual abnormalities (7o%) - oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, obesity, hirsutism, acne, and alopecia due to hyperandrogenism, acanthosis  nigricans due to insulin resistance, and infertility.
Rotterdam criterion is used to diagnose Pcos. The presence of any two of the three components of this criteria establishes the diagnosis of Pcos.
•  oligo/ amenorrhoea, anovulation, infertility



• Hirsutism/ acne
• Ultrasound findings-
•
Enlarged ovaries with ovarian volume will be more than 1o mL
•
12 or more small follicles each of 2-9 mm in size placed peripherally.
Investigations
• Hormonal studies
• UsG is diagnostic of PCos - it shows enlarged ovaries with multiple follicles in the periphery. It also rules out other pathologies like ovarian tumors, endometrial hyperplasia.
• Laparoscopy (therapeutic). It reveals bilateral enlarged ovarian cysts.
The ultrasound image below shows an enlarged ovary with multiple follicles in the periphery.


Management of PCoD is individualized. weight reduction and lifestyle changes are the first-line    therapy for PCoD. oral contraceptive pills (oCP), preferably fourth-generation pills with 3o mcg   E2 and 2-3 mg drospirenone are used to treat menstrual abnormalities. Hirsutism and acne are     managed with oCP with cyproterone acetate and topical agents such as epiornithine, clindamycin lotion 1%, erythromycin gel 2%, and isotretinoin.
Patients with PCoD are more prone to developing insulin resistance which can be controlled with metformin(option A, C and D) and acarbose. Patients presenting with infertility are treated by
inducing ovulation using clomiphene as a first-line drug, along with dexamethasone and letrozole.
surgical management includes laparoscopic ovarian drilling or puncture of not more than four cysts in each ovary.
Note:
PCos in association with diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease presenting in reproductive age group is known as ""x syndrome"".",,B,6202-3845-1.png
Q12,which of the following drug is not given in endometrosis?,"a)Medroxyprogesterone acetate
b)cabergoline
c)Estradiol
d)Letrazole","Estradiol is not used in the treatment of endometriosis as estrogen administration leads to further development of endometriotic lesions.
Treatment of endometriosis:
1. Medical management:
For minimal disease, the drug of choice is NSAIDs. oral contraceptive pills are given if associated menstrual complaints are present. ocps inhibit gonadotropin release and decrease the menstrual flow.
For moderate to severe diseases, oral progestogens are the first drugs to be started. They
antagonize estrogenic effects on the endometrium, causing endometrial atrophy. The drug of choice is GnRH agonist.
Endometriosis requires angiogenesis.cabergoline, a vascular endothelial growth factor pathway inhibitor, is an effective therapeutic option for women with chronic pain due to endometriosis.  (option B)
Mnemonic to remember drugs used: GoLD GAp
• G: GnRH analog(Leuprolide)
• o: oral contraceptive pills
• L: Letrozole(option D)
• D: Danazol
• G: Gestrinone
• A: Antiprogesterone-Mifepristone
• p: progesterone(Medroxyprogesterone acetate)(option A)
2. Surgical management:
primary surgery is preferred in infertile women because hormonal treatment would delay
pregnancy.
• conservative surgery: Endometrial deposits are destroyed by electrocautery/laser.
• Laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA)
• Radical surgery: Total hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy.
Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial tissue (glands and stroma) outside the uterus.
Risk factors for the development of endometriosis
• Family history
• Nulliparity
• prolonged exposure to endogenous estrogen (early menarche, late menopause)
• Estrogen therapy



• In utero exposure to diethylstilbesterol (DES) key clinical features
• Dysmenorrhea
• Lower abdominal pain
• Infertility
• Pain during urination or defecation
• Constipation or diarrhea
• Irregular bleeding
The gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis has been a visual inspection by laparoscopy, preferably with histological confirmation. Laparoscopy helps detect and diagnose pelvic
endometriosis, locate the site of endometriosis and staging, take a biopsy, and perform surgical ablation as a part of treatment.
other investigations:
• CA-125 levels: raised in endometriosis.
• Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1) levels: raised in the peritoneal fluid
• MRI
• Color Doppler
• Anti-endometrial antibodies",,C,6202-3845-2.png
Q13,"Lady with 28 weeks of gestation presents with fever, acute pain abdomen, and mild leucocytosis. what is the most probable diagnosis?","a)uterine torsion
b)Infection of fibroid
c)Red degeneration of fibroid
d)preterm labor","In the given scenario history of acute pain abdomen with fever and mild leukocytosis in a 28-week pregnant woman is suggestive of red degeneration of fibroid.



Red degeneration is the most common complication of fibroids in pregnancy. It is due to the
breakdown of the fibroid resulting in ischemia and pain. key clinical features in this condition are:
• Low-grade fever
• Tender uterus on palpation
• Elevated leukocytes
• Elevated ESR
The diagnosis is confirmed with an ultrasound. It is usually self-limiting and can be managed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
other options
option A - uterine torsion is defined as rotation of more than 45 degrees around the long axis of the uterus. The most usual symptoms of uterine torsion are birth obstruction, abdominal pain,    vaginal bleeding, shock, and urinary and intestinal symptoms. The treatment in the earlier
months of pregnancy is immediate laparotomy and detorsion of the uterus. Near-term or during labor cesarean section is carried out, and elimination of the possible etiologic factors.
option B - Infection is common in submucous and myomatous polyps if they project into the cervical canal or the vagina. An infected polyp can cause blood-stained purulent discharge.
Infection is more likely in the postpartum and postabortal state.
option D -preterm labor is diagnosed with the help of the following criteria
• Regular uterine contractions with or without pain (at least one in every 1o minutes)
• Dilatation (&gt; 2 cm) and effacement (8o%) of the cervix
• Length of the cervix (measured by TVS) &lt; 2.5 cm and funneling of the internal os
• pelvic pressure, backache and/or vaginal discharge or bleeding.",,C,
Q14,choose the incorrectly matched option.,"a)uterine prolapse - vaginal hysterectomy
b)vault prolapse - sacrospinous ligament suspension
c)cystocele - colposuspension
d)Rectocele - posterior colporrhaphy","The incorrectly matched option is cystocele-colposuspension. The surgery performed for cystocoele is anterior colporrhaphy.
Various surgeries were performed for the management of uterovaginal prolapse:
• Anterior colporrhaphy: This is done for cystocele or cystourethrocele.
• posterior colporrhaphy/ colpoperineorrhaphy: This is done for posterior defects like rectocele or rectal defects with perineal laxity.
• Le Forte's repair: This is preferred only in elderly women with advanced prolapse, or those unfit for surgery. women wanting an active sexual life are poor candidates for this procedure as it
creates an adhesive area in the midline.
• Abdominal sling surgeries: young women desirous of retaining menstrual and reproductive
functions are ideal candidates. These surgeries use tapes as slings to prevent organ descent. These include:



• Abdominal wall cervicopexy (modified by purandare and Mathre) - sling attached to cervix posteriorly near uterosacral ligaments.
• shirodkar's sling surgery - the sling fixes the cervix to the lumbosacral fascia.
• khanna's sling surgery - sling fixed to the anterior superior iliac spine, strengthening the Mackenrodt's ligament.
• Fothergill surgery (Manchester operation): An anterior colporrhaphy is combined with
amputation of the cervix. The Mackenrodt ligaments are then sutured in front of the cervix
followed by a colpoperineorrhaphy. It is suitable for women &lt;4o years desiring reproductive function, but fertility may be reduced.
• ward-Mayo surgery: This is a combination of vaginal hysterectomy + pelvic floor repair. It is done in women &gt;4o years, not desiring reproductive function.
• Moschowitz surgery: This is performed for enterocele repair where the pouch of Douglas is obliterated.
Management of vault prolapse:
• If the patient is fit for abdominal surgery: Transabdominal sacral colpopexy, i.e., suspending the vault to the sacral promontory extraperitoneally. It is best suited for younger women since coital   difficulty following vaginal surgery is avoided
• If the patient is not fit for abdominal surgery: Right Transvaginal sacrospinous colpopexy. It is usually preferred in obese and elderly women, who are not fit for abdominal surgery.
• colpocleisis is permissible if sexual activity is not desired",,C,
Q15,"Fructose is absent in the seminal fluid, which of the following statements is true regarding this:","a)congenital absence of seminal vesicles
b)obstruction in the ejaculatory duct
c)Both
d)None","Fructose is absent in seminal fluid in case of congenital absence of seminal vesicle and obstruction of the ejaculatory duct.
The ejaculatory duct is formed by the fusion of the ductus deferens and the duct of the seminal
vesicle. A major portion of the semen volume is contributed by the seminal vesicles. seminal fluid is alkaline and protects sperm from acidity in prostatic secretions and in the vagina. seminal fluid also provides fructose as an energy source for sperm. If seminal vesicle is absent or if there is an    obstruction at the level of the ejaculatory duct then semen analysis will reveal low ejaculate
volume, oligospermia or azoospermia, low pH, and absence of fructose.",,C,
Q16,"A 15-year-old female presents with primary amenorrhea and signs of virilization. she has prepubertal development of breasts and pubic hair and is tanner stage 2. she has a
blind-ended vagina and clitoromegaly. she has normal male testosterone levels. Her genotype is 46xy. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)5 alpha reductase deficiency
b)17 alpha hydroxylase deficiency
c)Androgen insensitivity syndrome
d)swyer syndrome","The clinical scenario points towards the diagnosis of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency.
The 5 alpha-reductase enzyme converts testosterone into a more potent form of the male sex
hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Testosterone is required for the development of male internal genitalia, whereas DHT has a role in the development of male external genitalia. At
puberty, testosterone is responsible for aggressive psychosexual behavior, deepening of the voice, increased muscle mass, and initiating spermatogenesis.



In 5 alpha reductase deficiency, there is a failure of conversion of testosterone to
dihydrotestosterone. As testosterone levels are normal there is a normal development of wolffian ducts and thus male internal genitalia are normal. However, some cases may have a blind-ending vagina.
As levels of DHT are low the child will have a female-looking external genitalia at birth. These
children tend to be raised as females till puberty, by which they start exhibiting virilization which is caused by testosterone. Hence clitoromegaly is seen. There is a lack of breast development as
testosterone is not converted to estrogen. pubic hair is scanty as its development depends on both testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.
Investigations reveal an increase in the ratio of testosterone to DHT after hCG administration.
If the child wants to be raised as a female, then the testes have to be removed before the child
attains puberty and virilization of the child. Estrogen therapy that is appropriate for inducing and maintaining feminization should be started at the time of usual pubertal maturation or
immediately after gonadectomy is performed in an adult. surgical correction in the form of vaginoplasty is performed. If the child is raised as a male corrective procedure include
hypospadias correction, correction of chordee, and reconstruction of the urethra.
other options
option B: 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency results in decreased production of testosterone by
adrenal glands. However, there will be normal testosterone production from the testes. Hence
depending on the testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels the child may have female-looking    external genitalia or ambiguous genitalia at birth. 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency also results in a decrease in 17-oH progesterone levels and cortisol levels. Hence there is an increase in ACTH due to the loss of negative feedback which increases aldosterone. Due to an increase in aldosterone,
the child will have hypertension and hypokalemia.
option C: Androgen insensitivity syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder in which
the androgen receptors are absent, scanty, or fail to respond to testosterone. Hence there will be    no signs of virilization. The serum testosterone levels will be elevated. There will be normal breast development as testosterone is converted to estrogen.
option D: swyer syndrome results from a mutation in the sRY gene on the Y chromosome. This   results in dysgenetic gonads. There is no production of AMH and testosterone and hence there is development of female internal and external genitalia. There will be no signs of virilization.",,A,
Q17,which one of the following is a virilising tumor of the ovary?,"a)Arrhenoblastoma
b)Thecoma
c)Brenners tumor
d)carcinoid tumor","Arrhenoblastoma (sertoli-Leydig cell tumor) of the ovary is a virilizing tumor of the ovary.
sertoli-Leydig cell tumors are a type of sex-cord stromal ovarian tumors. It is most commonly
seen in women of reproductive age group. These produce excess androgens and are hence known   as virilizing tumors. Menstrual irregularities and signs of virilization like hirsutism and deepening of the voice are common presenting complaints. Microscopy reveals sertoli cells and Leydig cells.
other options:
option B: Thecomas typically produce estrogen (female sex hormone). Excess estrogen production can lead to symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia, or



endometrial cancer.
option C: Brenner tumor (transitional cell tumor) is a benign, epithelial, unilateral tumor,
resembling a fibroma. Histologically, walthard cell rests and coffee bean nuclei are seen. Brenner tumors represent only 2-3% of all ovarian neoplasms, and &lt;2% of these tumors are malignant.  option D: In carcinoid tumors, excessive levels of serotonin is produced which causes flushing,
diarrhea, wheezing, damage to the tricuspid valve, etc. The levels of 5-oH indole acetic acid (serotonin metabolite) are elevated in the urine.",,A,

d)wait and watch","In this patient, the membranes are intact and the 'bag of worms' palpaeted refers to the umbilical cord within the membrane, suggestive of cord presentation. The best course of management
would be to take the patient up for an emergency caesarean section.
Cord presentation refers to the presence of the umbilical cord below the presenting part over the internal os, within an intact bag of membranes, whereas in the case of a cord prolapse, the
membranes are ruptured and the cord lies externally. The goal of management in the event of a    cord presentation is to expedite delivery while keeping the membranes intact, and hence the best option would be to deliver the fetus via emergency LSCS. while the patient is being prepared for  surgery, she may be positioned in the exagerrated Sim's position (shown below) to avoid cord
compression.


In comparison, the management algorithm of cord prolapse is based on three important factors, which are: living or dead baby, maturity of the baby, degree of cervical dilatation, according to    which the following steps are taken:





other options:
option A: oxytocin should not be started as the patient should not be allowed to proceed to deliver via normal vaginal delivery due to the risk of cord prolapse and fetal death.
option B: The membranes should not be ruptured as this would lead to an overt cord prolapse and complicate the situation further.
option D: cord presentation is an obstetric emergency requiring immediate action.",,C,6215-3846.PNG;6216-3847.PNG
Q19,"A 2o-year-old woman visits the oPD with complaints of irregular menses since menarche and increased facial hair. Her BMI is 29 kg/m2 and her Ferriman-Gallwey score was 6. Her
testosterone level was o.36 ng/dl. Her mother is a diabetic on oral hypoglycemic agents. she should be advised the following, except?","a)ocPs
b)ocPs + Anti-androgens
c)Lifestyle modification
d)counselled about risk of metabolic syndrome","This patient's history of irregular menstrual cycles and increased facial hair and hirsutism as per the Ferriman-Gellway score are suggestive of polycystic ovarian syndrome (Pcos).
Anti-androgens are not recommended in the initial therapy of Pcos.
Hormonal therapy in Pcos is initiated with combined ocPs which are useful in treating
menstrual abnormalities, reducing acne, and hirsutism. Anti-androgens arerecommended in
Pcos only if patients have no improvement in hirsutism after 6 months of therapy with ocPs
alone. Further, a serum testosterone level of o.36 ng/dl is within the normal range (o.2-o.8 ng/dl) there is no current indication to begin anti-androgen therapy in this patient.
Pcos is an endocrinopathy seen in women of reproductive age, affecting multiple
systems. Rotterdam criteria is used to diagnose PcoD. The presence oftwo of the three components of this criteria establishes the diagnosis:
• oligo/amenorrhoea, anovulation, infertility
• Hirsutism/acne
• ultrasound findings:
• Enlarged ovaries with ovarian volume will be more than 1o mm3
• 12 or more small follicles each of 2-9 mm in size placed peripherally



ultrasound image given below shows an enlarged ovary seen in Pcos with multiple follicles in the periphery.


Patients with Pcos are at risk of developing metabolic syndrome (syndrome X), characterised by  abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, impaired fasting glucose, high triglyceride levels, and low HDL cholesterol levels.
Treatment of PcoD:
• Lifestyle changes (option c) such as weight reduction, smoking cessation, are recommended and most important in preventing metabolic syndrome (option D).
• Fourth-generation oral contraceptive pills (ocP) (option A) containing ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone are used for treating menstrual abnormalities, reducing acne, and hirsutism.
• ocP with cyproterone acetate is prescribed for Pcos patients with hirsutism.
• Patients with PcoD are prone to developing insulin resistance, which can be controlled with metformin. Acarbose can be used as an alternative if metformin is contraindicated.
• Infertility in PcoD patients is treated with clomiphene as the first-line drug for inducing
ovulation. Dexamethasone is used in combination to improve fertility rates. Letrozole is used off-label in clomiphene-resistant cases.
surgical options include laparoscopic ovarian drilling or puncture of not more than four cysts in  each ovary. This is done either by laser or by unipolar electrocautery. It restores endocrine levels and improves fertility. surgery is indicated only if:
• Medical therapy fails
• Hyperstimulation occurs
• Infertile women
• Previous pregnancy losses",,B,6202-3845-1.png
Q20,"A 34-year-old woman at 3o weeks of gestation presents with complaints of bleeding Pv and abdominal pain. she has drenched her clothes and has experienced decreased fetal
movements. on examination, her cervix was 6cm dilated and 5o% effaced. Her BP was
15o/1oommHg, PR - 1oo beats/min. Her abdomen corresponded to 34 weeks and she had a   tense and tender uterus with regular contractions and no fetal heart sounds were heard. Her urine protein is 2+ and there is no active bleeding. what is the ideal management?","a)Antihypertensives + ARM (Artificial Rupture of Membranes)
b)Antihypertensives + emergency caesarean section
c)Antihypertensives + tocolytics
d)observation","The clinical scenario of painful antepartum haemorrhage associated with pre-eclampsia
(hypertension + proteinuria) and fetal death is suggestive of Grade 2 abruptio placentae. In this  case, as there is fetal death and the patient is in labor, the best approach would be to administer antihypertensives and deliver the fetus vaginally.
Abruptio placenta is the partial/total placental separation from its implantation site before delivery. The bleeding may be:
• Revealed - blood dissects downwards between membranes and uterine wall to escape through the cervix
• Concealed - blood accumulates between the detached placenta and uterus, and the uterus is larger than expected for the period of gestation
• Mixed - features of both co-existing
Hypertension in pregnancy is the most important risk factor for abruptio placenta. spasm of the    decidual spiral artery leads to endothelial damage and extravasation of blood in the placental bed, leading to fetal distress.  Patients often present with sudden onset abdominal pain, vaginal
bleeding, uterine tenderness, and frequent contractions. Based on the degree of  placental separation, patients are clinically graded as follows:
• Grade o – Asymptomatic, abruption is diagnosed only after delivery by the presence of retroplacental clots.
• Grade 1 – Vaginal bleeding, mild uterine tetani. No maternal and fetal complications.
• Grade 2 – with fetal distress or death
• Grade 3 – with maternal complications like shock, renal failure, coagulopathy, or death.
The management of abruption is based on whether the patient is in labor and the fetal status, with the goal being to expedite delivery and prevent complications such as shock and coagulopathy.
Immediate management begins with the administration of IV crystalloids and arrangement of blood for the patient, along with BP control.
• If the patient is in labor and the cervix is favourable, in case the fetal heart rate is reassuring, or in case the fetal has died - amniotomy and vaginal delivery.
• If the patient is not in labor or fetal heart tracing indicate fetal distress - an emergency caesarean section is indicated. (option B)
other options:
options C and D: Abruption is considered an obstetric emergency and hence tocolytics or expectant management have no place in this situation.",,A,
Q21,"which of the following vessels will serve as an alternate source of blood supply to prevent uterine ischaemia, in case the primary artery is ligated in the event of PPH?","a)ovarian artery
b)uterine artery
c)Arcuate Artery
d)Round Ligament Artery","In the event of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), bleeding occurs from the uterine artery which is the primary vessel ligated, and the inflow from the ovarian artery compensates to prevent
ischaemia.



The arterial supply to the uterus is by two main arteries: the uterine artery, which is a branch of   the anterior division of the internal iliac artery, and the ovarian artery which is a direct branch of the abdominal aorta. Ligating the uterine artery limits the supply from the internal iliac artery
and hence the ovarian artery serves as the alternate blood supply.
The uterine artery runs from its origin towards the cervix, crosses the ureter and then ascends  with a tortuous course along the lateral aspect of the uterus up to ovary, where it anastomoses  with the ovarian artery.  It is based on this anatomical relationship that the order of ligation of vessels to arrest bleeding in atonic postpartum haemorrhage is the uterine artery &gt; ovarian   artery &gt; internal iliac artery.
other options:
option C: The arcuate artery is a branch of the uterine artery itself.
option D: The artery to the round ligament artery is a branch from the ovarian artery.",,A,6219-3848.PNG;6219-3848-1.png
Q22,which of the following are responsible for increased blood volume during pregnancy?,"a)Action of estrogen and aldosterone
b)Increased fluid retention by the kidneys
c)Both A and B
d)Action of ADH and aldosterone","Increased blood volume during pregnancy is due to estrogen and aldosterone, both of which cause increased fluid retention by the kidneys, hence both options A and B are correct.
Increased estrogen during pregnancy directly causes fluid retention and also activates the RAAS  pathway causing increased aldosterone, leading to fluid retention by the kidneys. Although there is a reset in the threshold for response to ADH, the levels of ADH remain unchanged.
Although all components of blood are increased during pregnancy, plasma volume is increased
more than the RBC volume, leading to a relative hemodilution, responsible for what is termed as   physiological anaemia of pregnancy. The increased plasma volume is beneficial as it reduces blood viscosity, allowing for effective gaseous exchange in placental and fetal circulation, it is protective  against the possible adverse effects of change in posture causing vascular compression, and also
against the possible blood loss during delivery.",,C,
Q23,which of the following is not required to be a part of the consent for surgery in a patient who has an obstetric score of G6L1A3 with a history of two previous LScS?,"a)Risk of bladder injury during surgery due to PAS
b)Risk of bowel injury during surgery due to PAS
c)Possible need for hysterectomy during surgery due to PAS
d)Possible need for blood transfusion","A patient with a history of two previous caesarean deliveries would be at a high risk of having a morbidly adherent placenta or placenta accreta spectrum (pAS). However, bowel injury is an
unlikely complication of placenta accreta spectrum (pAS) and hence may not be required as part of the consent for surgery in such a patient.
The placenta accreta spectrum is characterized by abnormally implanted, invasive, or adhered
placenta. This occurs due to partial or complete absence of the decidua basalis and imperfect
development of the Nitabuch layer. The major risk factors include associated placenta previa and previous cesarean delivery as seen in this patient.
There are three variants of this condition based on the depth of trophoblastic growth.
• placenta accreta, the villi are attached to the myometrium.
• placenta increta, the villi invade into the myometrium.
• placenta percreta, the villi penetrate the myometrium into the serosa, with possible adherence to the bladder wall





PAS can be diagnosed in the antepartum period by ultrasound which will reveal loss of normal
hypoechoic retroplacental zone between the placenta and uterus, placental vascular lacunae,
bridging vessels, and placental bulging leading to distortion of the contour of the uterus. MRI can be performed when the ultrasound is inconclusive. However, ultrasound remains the modality of  choice for diagnosis.
Patients with PAS have a significant risk of haemorrhage and shock. Management of this
condition therefore involves appropriate multidisciplinary efforts with adequate surgical,
anesthetic, intensive care, and blood banking capabilities. Patients are recommended scheduled delivery between 34 o/7 to 35 6/7 weeks of gestation and the risk of hemorrhage necessitating     paripartum hysterectomy and blood transufsion, or bladder injury in percreta must be properly communicated.",,B,6219-3848-2.png
Q24,A 3o-year-old nulligravida is on DMPA and she comes 14 days past her due date for her next DMPA. what should be advised to her?,"a)Administer DMPA in the next cycle
b)Take DMPA with back up for 7 days
c)Ask to do UPT before taking the DMPA
d)Take DMPA and no back up needed","DMPA can be given as a repeat dose up to 4 weeks later from the scheduled date (within grace
period) after the previous dose. But if the patient is presenting later than that, she should be given a urine pregnancy test before the next dose of DMPA.
DMPA stands for Depot Medroxy Progesterone Acetate. It is an injectable progesterone
formulation available for contraception. It acts by:
• Bringing changes in the cervical mucus
• Making the endometrium hostile
• Preventing ovulation
Disadvantages include spotting and intermediate per vaginal bleeding.
DMPA guidelines:
• Injections to be provided every 3 months
• It can be given up to 2 weeks later without any other contraception.



• DMPA can be given as a repeat dose up to up to 4 weeks later from the scheduled date (within grace period) after the previous dose.",,D,6222-3850.PNG;6222-3849.PNG
Q25,"A 67-year-old female is brought to the oPD in a poor general condition. on examination, she  was found to have a right ovarian mass. Her cT scan indicated peritoneal caking. Her cA-125 levels were 12oo IU/L. what would be the management in this case?","a)Debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy
b)chemotherapy followed by debulking surgery
c)Debulking surgery followed by radiotherapy
d)Staging laparotomy","In the given scenario, the patient presents with poor general condition and the presence of
peritoneal metastases is suggestive of stage III ovarian cancer. The preferred management would be to initiate neoadjuvant chemotherapy with three cycles of paclitaxel + carboplatin over three     weeks, followed by debulking/cytoreductive surgery, and then continue another three cycles of
chemotherapy.
Epithelial ovarian cancers are treated with a multimodality approach. The usual approach in stage I and II disease where the patient is fit for surgery, is to perform cytoreductive surgery, which also helps in determining the extent of disease, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (option A).



However, patients with advanced disease and poor general condition are unfit for anaesthesia and surgery at the time of presentation and have a higher operative risk, hence neoadjuvant
chemotherapy prior to surgery is preferred and has been shown to reduce morbidity in such patients.
other options:
option c: ovarian tumors are not radiosensitive and radiotherapy does not form part of the protocol for treatment of ovarian cancers.
option D: staging laparotomy is the term used to describe the procedure of surgically exploring patients with early-stage disease and would not be the approach in a patient with advanced
disease in whom chemotherapy followed by debulking surgery is indicated.",,B,
Q26,which of the following leads to an increased risk for borderline ovarian tumors?,"a)Polycystic ovarian Syndrome (PcoS)
b)Low parity
c)oral contraceptive Pill (ocP) intake
d)Functional ovarian cysts","Low parity is a risk factor for the development of borderline ovarian tumors.
Borderline ovarian tumors are ovarian epithelial tumors oflow malignant potential, defined
histologically by atypical epithelial proliferation without stromal invasion. They are classified as either serous or mucinous. The following are the risk factors for their development:
• low parity / unopposed estrogen
• infertility
• obesity
• smoking
clinically patients present with symptoms similar to that of a benign ovarian tumor such as a    mass per abdomen, abdominal pain and alteration in menstrual cycles. patients require similar investigations but the diagnosis of borderline ovarian tumor is based on biopsy. conservative     surgery is usually the preferred treatment approach especially in patients who wish to retain
fertility. Appendectomy is usually recommended in the mucinous variety to prevent
pseudomyxoma peritonei. patients do not require chemotherapy or radiotherapy for treatment but these tumours tend to recur and hence regular follow-up is advised.",,B,
Q27,A 28-year-old multigravida comes to the emergency at night with an inversion of the uterus   following the delivery of the baby when the nurse waited till the delivery of the placenta. Her BP is 11o/7o mmHg. Pulse rate 9o beats/min. what should be the management in this case?,"a)Manually remove placenta and then reposition the uterus
b)start oxytocin infusion
c)Reposition the uterus without removing placenta
d)shift the patient to OT and reposition the uterus under anaesthesia","This patient with a uterine inversion with stable vitals should undergo manual reposition of the uterus without removing the placenta
uterine inversion occurs when there is excessive traction leading to the loss of the uterine convexity and protrusion of the uterus outside the vaginal introitus.
Risk factors for uterine inversion:
• Fundal attachment of the placenta
• uterine atony
• Attempts at cord traction before placental delivery



• Adherent placenta
There are 3 degrees of uterine inversion:
• First-degree - the fundus of the uterus inverts into the uterine cavity
• second-degree - the uterine fundus protrudes through the cervix and lies in the vagina
• Third-degree - the whole of the uterus is inverted and protrudes through the introitus
since uterine inversion presents with profuse bleeding and a severe degree of shock, it requires prompt diagnosis and management. It is managed by promptly repositioning the uterus by
exerting a firm and constant pressure on the inverted uterine fundus. The placenta should not be removed until after the replacement of the uterus if it is still attached to the uterus.",,C,
Q28,The recombinant form of vaccine to prevent cervical cancer has which of the following proteins?,"a)L1
b)E6 and E7
c)E1 and E2
d)L2","The recombinant HPV vaccine use virus-like particles (VLPs) that consists of the HPV L1 major capsid protein. The L1 protein self-assembles into VLPs when expressed in eukaryotic cells.
These VLPs contain the same epitopes as the HPV virion. However they do not contain genetic material and cannot transmit infection. The immunogenicity of the HPV vaccines relies on the  development of conformational neutralizing antibodies to epitopes displayed on viral capsids.
The nonavalent HPV vaccine works against strains 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58. It is usually commercialized in the name of Gardasil-9. It has received expanded indication which now
includes the prevention of oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers.
As per the December 2022 WHO updated dose schedules on HPV vaccines, the recommendations for different age groups are as follows:
• 1 or 2 doses schedule for the primary target of girls aged 9–14 years.
• 1 or 2 doses schedule for young women aged 15–20 years.
• 2 doses with a 6-month interval for women older than 21 years.
•
A minimum of 2 doses and when feasible 3 doses remain necessary for those known to be immunocompromised and/or HIV-infected.",,A,
