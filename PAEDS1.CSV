Q1,"A 4-year-old child was brought to the hospital with a history of loose stools. No history of
fever or blood in stools. The mother says he is irritable and eagerly drinks water if given. on examination, eyes are sunken and in the skin pinch test, the skin retracted within two
seconds but not immediately. what treatment is advised for the child?","a)Give oral fluids and zinc supplementation only and ask mother to come back if danger sign develops.
b)Give oral fluids and ask mother to continue the same and visit again the next day.
c)Consider severe dehydration start IV fluids, IV antibiotics, and refer to higher centre.
d)wait and observe.","In a child with diarrhea, thirst (eagerly drinks water), sunken eyes, restless and irritable behavior, and skin pinch showing slow retraction (&lt;2 seconds) point towards some dehydration.
Treatment includes oral rehydration therapy, zinc supplementation, and continued breastfeeding according to WHO integrated management of neonatal and childhood diseases (IMNCI) plan B.   The degree of dehydration is assessed and managed using the WHO IMNCI PLAN given below:",,A,5504-3517.PNG;5504-3516.PNG
Q2,A baby in the NICU is being evaluated for his features of microcephaly and hepatomegaly. CT scan revealed nodular periventricular calcifications. Congenital CMV infection is suspected.    which of the following samples is the best to detect the organism using PCR?,"a)Liver biopsy
b)CSF
c)Blood
d)Urine","Among the following options, urine is the best sample to be sent for the diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
In congenital CMV infections, the investigation of choice is PCR or viral culture. It should be done within the first three weeks of life (after this period, it is difficult to distinguish between a
congenital and an acquired infection). since not all affected infants are viremic at birth, urine is a more reliable sample than blood.
Most CMV transmission occurs in the first trimester. The risk of transmission is high in the third trimester. 9o% of the infected babies are asymptomatic and have lesser chances of having late
sequelae.



The clinical manifestations include
hepatosplenomegaly, petechial rashes, jaundice, chorioretinitis, and microcephaly. Neuroimaging shows intracranial periventricular calcifications. one of the long-term sequelae is sensorineural     hearing loss.
There is no definitive treatment for congenital cMV infection. Treatment
with ganciclovir is indicated only in patients with progressive neurologic disease and deafness. The image below shows periventricular calcifications:",,D,5505-3518.PNG
Q3,Identify the disease shown in the karyotype:,"a)cri-du–chat syndrome
b)Bloom syndrome
c)Angelman syndrome
d)Fragile X syndrome","In the karyotype, there is a partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5, which leads to cri-du-chat syndrome. partial aneuploidy occurs as a result of the breakdown of the
chromosomes.
cri-du-chat syndrome is a rare genetic disorder. Features of the condition are hypotonia, short stature, characteristic cry called a cat's cry in the first few weeks of life, microcephaly with
protruding metopic sutures, hypertelorism, bilateral epicanthic folds, high arched palate, flat nasal bridge, and intellectual disability.
Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and chromosomal analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the specific test to confirm the diagnosis.
Given below is a picture of the facies in cri-du-chat syndrome:





other options:
option B: Bloom syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by short stature, sun sensitivity, predeposition of development of cancer, and genomic instability.
option C: Angelman syndrome is caused due to deletion in the maternal chromosome 15 or by   paternal uniparental disomy. It primarily affects the nervous system. Characteristic features are delayed development, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and ataxia.
option D: Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder also termed Martin Bell syndrome. It is the    most common cause of inherited mental retardation (among the X-linked disorders), intellectual disability, and autism.",5499-3513.PNG,A,5506-3519.PNG
Q4,which of the following milestones would you generally expect a 3 year old child to display?,"a)Hopping on one foot
b)Spoon handling
c)copying a triangle
d)Repeats sentence of 1o syllables","The ability to handle a spoon well and feed self is usually developed by 24 months (2 years) and would be expected in a 3 year old child.
other options:
option A: The ability to hop on one foot usually develops by 48 months (4 years).
options C and D: The ability to draw a triangle from copy and repeating a sentence of 1o syllables usually develops at around 6o months (5 years) of age.
some key milestones of children from 15 months of age are listed below:

Q5,Dried blood spot (DBS) testing is commonly done in infants for:,"a)Inborn errors of metabolism
b)Blood grouping
c)Bilirubin testing
d)coombs Test","Dried blood spots (DBS) taken from the heel are used in neonatal screening for inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) using tandem mass spectroscopy (TMS).
TMS employs two mass spectrometers in series to screen blood samples for their presence and to determine concentrations of various substances like amino acids, fatty acids, and other
metabolites. A single sample can be used to screen multiple IEMs such as phenylketonuria, ethylmalonic encephalopathy, and glutaric acidemia.
Newborn screening using DBS is recommended for congenital hypothyroidism, G6pD deficiency, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and galactosemia.
universal screening is recommended for hearing loss, cyanotic congenital heart disease (pulse oximetry), hyperbilirubinemia, and congenital hip dysplasia (Ortolani and Barlow tests).
Hearing loss is screened with otoacoustic emission (OAE). Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) is indicated in infants who fail OAE.



Screening for hypoglycemia should be performed in infants who are small or large for gestational age, born to mothers with diabetes, preterm, or symptomatic.",,A,
Q6,A 4 day old baby is active and feeding well. He has a bilirubin level of 8 mg/dl. what is the next step in the management of the baby?,"a)Exchange transfusion
b)stop breastfeeding and start phototherapy
c)IV fluids and phototherapy
d)continue breastfeeding","Since this child has a bilirubin level of only 8 mg/dl on the 4th day, it points to physiologic   jaundice. The child is active and feeding well, the mother should be encouraged to continue breastfeeding frequently and exclusively.
All the other options would be possible treatment choices if the child had pathological jaundice.
physiological jaundice/Icterus neonatorum is due to increased bilirubin production from
the breakdown of fetal red blood cells combined with transient limitation in the conjugation of     bilirubin by the immature neonatal liver. It first appears on the 2nd or 3rd days usually peaks on the 4th day at 5-6 mg/dL and decreases to &lt;2 mg/dL between the 5th and 7th days after birth.
on the other hand, in pathological jaundice, appearance is within the first 24 hours after birth and may be present at or beyond the age of 2 weeks in term babies and 3 weeks in preterms
babies. There may be an elevated direct (or conjugated) bilirubin level. Jaundice visible on the palms and soles, unresponsiveness to phototherapy, and a rapid rise in bilirubin levels during  phototherapy indicate pathological jaundice.
phototherapy is initiated in babies with pathological jaundice when the bilirubin levels exceed the 95th percentile on the total serum bilirubin (TSB) normogram. Babies are kept at a distance of
3o-45 cm from the uv lamp (46o-49o nm) with eyes and gonads covered. It is avoided in babies with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to the risk of bronze-baby syndrome. Dehydration and   hypocalcemia are potential complications and breastfeeding is encouraged.
Exchange transfusion (ET) is done in cases of bilirubin encephalopathy, Rh incompatibility with significant hemolysis, and bilirubin values exceeding TSB cutoffs for ET.",,D,
Q7,The most appropriate expansion of Apgar is:,"a)Alert, pulse, grimace, activity, respiration
b)Assessment, pulse, grimace, alive, respiration
c)Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, respiration
d)Appearance, pressure, grimace, activity, respiration","The parameters to consider while calculating ApGAR score in newborn babies are:
• Appearance
• pulse rate
• Grimace
• Activity(muscle tone)
• Respiratory effort
The Apgar score is a systematic way of assessing the infant after birth at 1 and 5 minutes of life. It gives a maximum score of 1o which indicates the newborn is in the best possible condition.
changes in the Apgar scores denote the response of the infant to resuscitation. Apgar scores
should not be used to determine the need for resuscitation or to guide the steps of resuscitation. Apgar score alone should not be interpreted as evidence of asphyxia.



A score from 7-1o is considered normal. scores between o-3 require immediate resuscitation. If
the score at 5 minutes remains less than 7, the infant should be assessed again every 5 minutes for the next 2o minutes.
Causes for false positive ApGAR score are:
• prematurity
• Drugs like analgesics, narcotics, sedatives, magnesium sulfate
• Acute cerebral trauma
• precipitous delivery
• Airway obstruction (choanal atresia)
• Congenital pneumonia or sepsis
• Hemorrhage- hypovolemia
False-negative Apgar score is seen in maternal acidosis and high fetal catecholamine levels.",,C,
Q8,"A 15-day-old infant had conjunctivitis, which later developed into respiratory distress and pneumonia. chest xray examination revealed bilateral lung infiltrates. peripheral smear   count showed 14,3oo/μL (N 43, L 54, E3). which of the following is the most likely
pathogenic organism?","a)chlamydia trachomatis
b)streptococcus pneumonia
c)Neisseria gonorrhoeae
d)Mycoplasma pneumonia","The organism most likely to cause conjunctivitis, progressing to respiratory distress, and then pneumonia is Chlamydia trachomatis.
It is not possible to differentiate between chlamydial pneumonia and other causes of atypical pneumonia, like Mycoplasma (option D) based solely on the clinical presentation. Here, the   history of conjunctivitis makes it more likely to be a chlamydial infection.
pneumonia caused by C. trachomatis can develop in infants born to women with an untreated chlamydial infection in 1o-2o% of cases. It has a very characteristic presentation in
infancy, disease onset usually occurs around 1 and 3 months of age and is insidious, with a     persistent cough, tachypnea, and absence of fever (atypical pneumonia). Auscultation reveals rales; wheezing is uncommon.
The absence of fever and wheezing helps to distinguish C. trachomatis pneumonia from
respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia.
A distinctive laboratory finding is the presence of peripheral eosinophilia (&gt;4oo cells/µL). The most consistent finding on chest radiographs is hyperinflation accompanied by minimal
interstitial or alveolar infiltrates.
other options:
option B: pneumococcal pneumonia generally presents with features of lobar pneumonia. Fever, dyspnea, and productive cough are the primary symptoms.
option C: Although Neisseria gonorrhoeae is an important cause of ophthalmia neonatorum, it does not cause pneumonia-like features.
Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular organisms that produce basophilic inclusion bodies. They
are called energy parasites as they lack enzymes for ATp synthesis. They cannot grow on artificial media but can grow on cell lines (McCoy, HeLa, or the yolk sac of the chick embryo)



chlamydiae occur in two forms, the elementary body (extracellular, infective form)  and the
reticulate body (intracellular, non-infective, and replicative form) which are found inside inclusion bodies.
chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of ophthalmia neonatorum in developed
countries. Neonatal inclusion conjunctivitis is caused by serotypes D to K. chlamydia trachomatis inclusion conjunctivitis manifests relatively late, usually over 1 week after birth.
It is usually a venereal infection derived from the cervix or urethra of the mother during delivery. on examination, the conjunctiva is swollen and edematous. The discharge is initially watery, but  later becomes mucopurulent or bloody.
Newborns with suspected chlamydia infection should have samples drawn from both the
conjunctivae and oropharynx. since it is an obligate intracellular organism, swabs should also
include conjunctival epithelial cells if possible. Giemsa staining shows characteristic intracellular inclusion bodies. Diagnosis is usually established by PcR.
The treatment includes oral erythromycin for two weeks. Topical erythromycin to tetracycline ointment may also be used.
If left untreated, associated systemic diseases such as chlamydial otitis and pneumonia may
develop later. In all cases, both parents must receive appropriate treatment for genital infection.

Q9,"of the following, all are findings of the condition in the below chest x-ray except:","a)Increased pulmonary blood flow
b)Narrow vascular pedicle
c)pulmonary venous hypertension
d)Right atrial enlargement","The given chest x-ray shows an egg-on-string appearance seen in the transposition of great arteries (TGA). Enlargement of the left atrium is seen in TGA, not the right atrium.
The reason for left atrial enlargement is due to increased pulmonary blood flow.
TGA is characterized by the aorta arising from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle. This abnormal configuration leads to a narrow vascular pedicle.



As pulmonary vascular resistance drops during the first few days of life, blood flow through the pulmonary vasculature is increased. There is also elevated pulmonary venous pressure seen in   TGA, especially in infants with an intact interventricular septum.
The globular (egg) appearance of the heart due to abnormal convexity of the right atrial border  and left atrial enlargement, and the narrow superior mediastinum (string) result in the classical egg-on-string appearance.
TGA is the most specific heart disease in infants of diabetic mothers.
Early management includes an immediate infusion of prostaglandin E1 which keeps the ductus arteriosus patent for improving oxygenation. Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy is a palliative  catheter-based intervention that can be done to improve the hypoxic state before definitive
surgery. The procedure creates an opening in the atrial septum which allows better
inter-circulatory mixing of the blood. Jatene arterial switch procedure is the definitive surgery. Most infants with TGA do not survive till adulthood without corrective surgery.",5501-3514.PNG,D,
Q10,"In fetal alcohol syndrome, which of the following is not seen?","a)Thinning of corpus callosum
b)Microcephaly
c)Holoprosencephaly
d)Macrocephaly","Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with microcephaly rather than macrocephaly.
Alcohol exposure during pregnancy results in reduced brain volume in the frontal lobe, striatum, caudate nucleus, thalamus, and cerebellum. It also causes thinning of the corpus callosum and
abnormal functioning of the amygdala.
Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) are the leading preventable causes of developmental    delay and intellectual disability. FASDs encompass different conditions such as FAS, partial FAS, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, alcohol-related birth defect, and neurobehavioral    disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.
Diagnostic criteria for FASDs include characteristic facial features, prenatal/postnatal growth     deficiency, neurobehavioral impairment, and maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
The facial features of FAS include short palpebral fissures, a thin upper lip vermilion border, a smooth philtrum, epicanthic folds, a flattened nasal bridge, lowset and unparallel ears, and
retarded midfacial development.
cNS involvement leads to microcephaly, incomplete holoprosencephaly, and agenesis of the
corpus callosum and the cerebellar vermis. The neurocognitive features include developmental
delays, inattention, impulsivity, social impairments, and behavioral difficulties. common
comorbidities include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), self-regulation problems,  and impulse control issues. cardiac anomalies are also seen, with VSD being more common than ASD and tetralogy of Fallot.",,D,
Q11,A child presented with complaints of itching and discharges on flexure aspect of elbow and the lesions were red as shown below. what is your diagnosis?,"a)pemphigus vulgaris
b)psoriasis
c)post traumatic pigmentation
d)Atopic dermatitis","The presence of diffuse, erythematous, itchy plaques on the flexural aspects of the elbow of a child is suggestive of atopic dermatitis.



Atopic dermatitis is the cutaneous manifestation of atopy, characterized by a family history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, or eczema.
There is a clear genetic predisposition. A characteristic defect is an impaired epidermal barrier. In many patients a mutation in the gene encoding filaggrin (a structural protein in the stratum
granulosum) is responsible.
patients may display many immunoregulatory abnormalities, including increased IgE synthesis, increased serum IgE levels, and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions.
The disease progresses in three phases: Infantile, childhood, and adult.
In infants, the lesions of atopic eczema most frequently start on the face but may occur anywhere on the skin surface. often, the napkin area is relatively spared. when the child begins to crawl,
the exposed surfaces, especially the extensor aspect of the knees and elbows are most involved. The lesions consist of erythema and discrete or confluent oedematous papules. The papules
are intensely itchy and may become exudative and crusted as a result of rubbing. secondary infection and lymphadenopathy are common.
From 18 to 24 months onwards (childhood phase), the sites most characteristically involved are the elbow and knee flexures, a mixture of erythema, crusting, excoriation, hyper and
hypopigmentation, and warty lichenification may be seen depending on the skin type on the sides of the neck, wrists, and ankles. The sides of the neck may show reticulate pigmentation,
sometimes referred to as an atopic dirty neck. The erythematous and oedematous papules tend to be replaced by lichenification.
The picture in adults is essentially similar to that in later childhood, with lichenification, especially of the flexures and hands.",5502-3515.PNG,D,
Q12,"which of the following fits into the criteria of severe variable deceleration, variations less than:","a)9o beats per minute lasting for 6o seconds
b)8o beats per minute lasting for 6o seconds
c)1oo beats per minute lasting for 6o seconds
d)7o beats per minute lasting for 6o seconds","severe variable decelerations are defined as: Less than 7o beats/minute lasting at least 6o seconds.
variable deceleration is the abrupt decrease in FHR below the baseline. The decrease is 15 beats/minute or more, with a duration of 15 seconds or more but less than 2 minutes.
Mechanism: umbilical cord compression, leads to occlusion of the umbilical vein, hence there is decreased venous return to maintain cardiac output.
classification:
• Mild: more than 8o bpm irrespective of duration/ less than 3o seconds irrespective of HR/ 7o-8o bpm lasting 6o seconds
• Moderate: more than 7o bpm lasting 3o-6o seconds / 7o-8o bpm lasting more than 6o seconds
• severe: less than 7o bpm lasting at least 6o seconds",,D,
Q13,which of the following constitutes Hutchinson's triad?,"a)Interstitial keratitis, 8th nerve deafness, mulberry molars
b)Interstitial keratitis, 8th nerve deafness, Hutchinson molars
c)Interstitial keratitis, 8th nerve deafness, mulberry incisors
d)Interstitial keratitis, 8th nerve deafness, Hutchinson incisors","Hutchinson's triad refers to interstitial keratitis, 8th nerve deafness, and Hutchinson incisors. It is seen in late congenital syphilis.
The image below shows Hutchinson incisors:


congenital syphilis is due to Treponema pallidum. Early features include hepato-splenomegaly,  jaundice, diffuse lymphadenopathy, maculopapular or vesiculobullous rash involving hands and feet, persistent rhinitis (snuffles), and condylomatous lesions. skeletal changes like saber shins,  dental abnormalities like Hutchinson's teeth, and saddle nose (depression of the nasal root) are  some late findings.
other clinical features of congenital syphilis:
• clutton joint - Due to synovitis, with sterile synovial fluid
• Juvenile tabes and paresis
• Rhagades - Linear scars radiating from mucocutaneous fissures ofthe mouth, anus, and genitalia
• Mulberry molars - Abnormal 1st lower molars with excessive cusps
• sabre shin - Anterior bowing of the mid-portion of the tibia
• olympian brow - Bony prominence of the forehead",,D,5513-3521.PNG;5514-3522.PNG
