Q1,"A patient presented with vision loss. on radiological investigation, an aneurysm causing damage to the optic chiasma was noted. which of the following arteries is most likely to be the artery that is causing the damage?","a) Anterior communicating artery
b) Anterior choroidal artery
c) Middle cerebral artery
d) Anterior cerebral artery","An aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery is most likely to be causing damage to the optic chiasma, leading to vision loss in this patient.
circle of willis is a large arterial anastomosis that unites the internal carotid and vertebrobasilar systems. It lies in the subarachnoid space within the basal cisterns that surround the optic chiasma and infundibulum.
Anterior communicating artery aneurysm:
Anterior communicating artery (Acom) links the right and left anterior cerebral arteries and is directed anterior and superior to the optic chiasma. The aneurysm will protrude in the posterior direction and will impinge upon the optic chiasma from above, leading to loss of vision.
compression of the optic chiasma (central lesion) by an Acom aneurysm, will lead to bitemporal hemianopia i.e, loss of vision in the left/temporal halves of both visual fields. Nasal fibers of each retina cross through the chiasma at this level and hence, these fibers will be compromised.
Investigation: Digital subtraction angiogram is the definitive imaging modality for aneurysms arising from the circle of willis. other investigations are CT and MRI.",,A,222-221.PNG
Q2,"A 34-year-old man presented with fever and massive splenomegaly. on palpation, the spleen was 15 cm and directed obliquely when measured from the right iliac fossa. which of the following structures prevent the vertical and downward descent of the spleen?","a) Lienorenal ligament
b) Gastrosplenic ligament
c) phrenicocolic ligament
d) Lienophrenic ligament","The vertical and downward descent of the spleen is prevented by the phrenicocolic ligament.
The phrenicocolic ligament is not attached to the spleen. It attaches the splenic flexure of the colon to the diaphragm.
when the spleen gets enlarged, the phrenicocolic ligament along with the splenic flexure of the colon restricts its downward displacement. The enlargement of the spleen occurs towards the right iliac fossa and hence the spleen is directed obliquely.
splenic ligaments and their attachments:
splenic ligament | Attachments | contents
--- | --- | ---
phrenicocolic ligament | Diaphragm to the splenic flexure of the colon | -
phrenicosplenic ligament | The undersurface of the diaphragm to the spleen | -
splenorenal (lienorenal) ligament | Hilum of the spleen to the anterior surface of the left kidney | Tail of pancreas, splenic artery and vein
Gastrosplenic ligament | The greater curvature of the stomach to the upper pole of the spleen | short gastric vessels, Left gastroepiploic artery",,C,223-222.PNG
Q3,Identify the papillae from the given histological section.,"a) Fungiform
b) circumvallate
c) Filiform
d) Foliate","The given histological image is a section of the tongue showing circumvallate papillae, the largest papillae of the tongue.
circumvallate papillae are large cylindrical structures that are around 8-12 in number, covered by non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.
They are arranged in a V-shaped row immediately in front of the sulcus terminalis (not on the sides of the tongue) on the dorsal surface of the tongue. Numerous taste buds are present within the papillary walls.
serous glands of von Ebner empty via the ducts into the base of the sulcus.
Identification: They can be identified by their characteristic dome-shaped structure lined by stratified squamous epithelium.",219-218.PNG,B,225-224.PNG
Q4,"A 7-year-old boy was brought to the hospital with multiple fractures of the humerus secondary to a fall from height. on examination, there is difficulty in flexion of the elbow and supination of the forearm, and associated loss of sensation over the lateral aspect of the forearm. which is the nerve most likely to be injured?","a) Median nerve
b) Radial nerve
c) Musculocutaneous nerve
d) ulnar nerve","The given clinical vignette in a patient with difficulty in flexion of the elbow and supination of the forearm, with associated loss of sensation over the lateral aspect of the forearm, is suggestive of injury to the musculocutaneous nerve.
Course:
The musculocutaneous nerve (C5, C6, C7) is a branch of the lateral cord of the brachial plexus. It emerges at the lower border of the pectoralis minor and pierces coracobrachialis. It then descends between biceps brachii and brachialis.
It innervates all the muscles of the anterior compartment of the arm i.e.,
• Biceps brachii - involved in flexion of elbow and supination of the forearm
• Brachialis - involved in the flexion of the elbow
• Coracobrachialis - flexes the arm at the glenohumeral joint
cutaneous innervation of the lateral aspect of the forearm is by a branch of the musculocutaneous nerve, namely, the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm (c5, c6).
Hence, injury to the musculocutaneous nerve results in weakness of supination of forearm (biceps brachii), weakness in flexion of the elbow (biceps brachii, brachialis), and loss of sensation over the lateral aspect of the forearm (lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm).",,C,227-227.PNG
Q5,"A patient presented with jaw swelling and weight loss. suspecting a malignancy, the submandibular gland was resected. which is the most likely nerve to be damaged during submandibular gland resection?","a) Nerve to mylohyoid
b) Inferior alveolar nerve
c) Lingual nerve
d) Hypoglossal nerve","The most likely nerve to be damaged during submandibular gland resection is the lingual nerve.
It loops around the submandibular duct and hence is susceptible to injury during submandibular gland resection.
course:
The lingual nerve arises from the posterior trunk of the mandibular nerve (v3 branch of the trigeminal nerve). As the lingual nerve enters the floor of the oral cavity, it lies on the deep portion of the submandibular gland.
The submandibular duct lies between the lingual and hypoglossal nerves. As the duct reaches the anterior border of the hyoglossus, it is crossed by the lingual nerve and lies in close proximity to the nerve. Hence lingual nerve injury is the most common.
Injury:
The lingual nerve is at risk to be injured during submandibular gland resection because dissection of the submandibular duct from the nerve is required.
The manifestations of lingual nerve injury depend on whether the lesion is proximal or distal to where it is joined by the chorda tympani nerve.",,C,228-228.PNG
Q6,A patient underwent a coronary bypass graft with the great saphenous vein. The patient now complains of paresthesia and sensory loss over the medial aspect of the leg and foot. which of the following nerves is most likely to be involved?,"a) superficial peroneal nerve
b) saphenous nerve
c) Femoral nerve
d) sural nerve","The given clinical vignette in a patient with paresthesia and sensory loss over the medial aspect of the leg and foot is suggestive of injury to the saphenous nerve.
Injury to the saphenous nerve is common following venous cut down for access to the great saphenous vein, in this case for coronary bypass graft.
saphenous nerve:
It is the longest and largest cutaneous branch of the femoral nerve. It arises from the posterior division of the femoral nerve. The saphenous nerve then descends along the medial border of the tibia along with the great saphenous vein (anterior to the vein) and supplies the skin on the medial side of the knee, leg, and foot as far as up to the first metatarsophalangeal joint.
saphenous nerve injury:
when the great saphenous vein is being harvested for coronary bypass graft, injury to the saphenous nerve is common as it closely travels with the great saphenous vein. sensory loss over the medial side of the knee, leg, and foot is observed in saphenous nerve injury.",,B,230-232.PNG
Q7,"During the clinical examination of the nervous system, which of the following nerves can be tested by touching the highlighted structure?","a) IX
b) X
c) XI
d) XII","The structure marked in the given sagittal section of the head and neck is the uvula. The sensory supply to the uvula is by the glossopharyngeal nerve and it is tested in this case.
Nerve supply by glossopharyngeal nerve:
• sensory fibers to the uvula, tympanic cavity, pharyngotympanic tube, tonsils, fauces, nasopharynx, and posterior third of the tongue.
• Motor fibers to the stylopharyngeus muscle
• parasympathetic secretomotor fibers to the parotid gland
• Gustatory fibers for the postsulcal part of the tongue.
pharyngeal plexus:
The nerve supply of the pharynx is mainly from the pharyngeal plexus of nerves. It is formed by the pharyngeal branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve. The vagus nerve provides the motor supply and the glossopharyngeal nerve provides the sensory supply.",220-219.PNG,A,nan
