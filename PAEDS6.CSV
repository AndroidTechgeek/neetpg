Q2,which one of the following is not a feature in cerebral palsy?,"a)Hypotonia
b)Microcephaly
c)Ataxia
d)Flaccid paralysis","Flaccid paralysis is not a feature of cerebral palsy (cp).
cp is an upper motor neuron disease characterized by rigidity and scissoring gait. Flaccid paralysis would be seen in lower motor neuron disease.
other options:
option A: Hypotonia is a characteristic feature of athetoid cp. These infants generally have poor head control.
option B: Microcephaly can be seen in cp due to perinatal insults to the developing brain.

Q3,which of the following is not seen in a child with cystic fibrosis?,"a)sweat chloride test chloride conc of 7o mEq/L
b)Increase immunoreactive trypsinogen level
c)Hyperkalemia
d)contraction alkalosis","patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) can present with hypokalemia and not hyperkalemia.
Excess production of sweat in CF leads to a significant loss of chloride ions from the extracellular fluid (ECF). The depletion of chloride from the ECF causes an intracellular
shift of potassium and activation of renin-aldosterone system, leading to hypokalemia.
The excessive depletion of sodium chloride in CF also affects the acid-base balance. It leads to
increased reabsorption of bicarbonate by the kidneys through the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger on the intercalated cells. This process is known as contraction alkalosis (option D) and results in   hyponatremic hypochloremic alkalosis.
Cystic fibrosis, also known as mucoviscidosis, is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a    mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7q. This gene is responsible for encoding ATp-gated chloride channels in the apical membranes of



epithelial cells, which regulate the flow of ions across various epithelial membranes in the body, including sweat glands, respiratory airways, and pancreatic ducts. The defect in CFTR leads to    elevated salt concentrations in sweat and the production of thick, viscous secretions in the
respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.
Diagnostic tests for CF include the sweat chloride test (option A), where an increased chloride
concentration (&gt;6o mEq/L) is considered diagnostic. Immunoreactive trypsinogen levels
(option B) are also measured for newborn screening, as they tend to be elevated in CF. Genetic     testing for CFTR gene mutations is considered the gold standard and should be performed for all suspected cases. In equivocal cases, nasal transepithelial potential difference can be estimated as an additional diagnostic test.
The criteria for diagnosis is the presence of clinical symptoms affecting at least one organ system (respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary) or a positive newborn screening or a sibling with  cystic fibrosis, along with evidence of dysfunction of the CFTR gene (two positive sweat chloride   test results obtained on separate days or identification of two CFTR mutations by genetic
testing or an abnormal measurement of nasal potential difference).

Q4,"A 9-year-old boy has swelling of knee joints and non-blanching rashes as seen in the picture.  urine exam reveals haematuria +++ and proteinuria +. Platelet levels are normal. what is the



probable diagnosis?","a)Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
b)Henoch Schonlein purpura (HSP)
c)Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)
d)Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN)","The given clinical scenario showing swelling of knee joints (arthritis), non-blanching rash in the lower limbs (palpable purpura), along with hematuria and proteinuria (renal involvement) in a   child is suggestive of Henoch Schonlein purpura (HSP).
HSP (IgA vasculitis) is a small vessel vasculitis most commonly seen in the age group of 3-8 years. It generally follows an upper respiratory tract infection and there is a history of atopy in one-third of the cases.
The pathology of HSP involves leukocytoclastic vasculitis and the deposition of IgA in the affected blood vessels. IgA is deposited in the glomerular mesangium in a distribution similar to that of
IgA nephropathy.



clinical manifestations include palpable purpura, the hallmark feature of HSP, which
characteristically involves the extensor surfaces of arms and legs. Musculoskeletal symptoms such as arthritis and arthralgia are common. Gastrointestinal symptoms can include abdominal pain,    vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding. Renal involvement may lead to gross or microscopic hematuria, nephritic syndrome, or nephrotic syndrome. Renal manifestations are more severe in adults. A
rapidly progressive form of glomerulonephritis is seen in some cases. Nephritis usually follows the appearance of the rash.
Diagnosis of HSP is primarily based on clinical findings, including the palpable purpura, along with the presence of other symptoms. Laboratory tests are not specific to HSP but may show
nonspecific markers of inflammation and sometimes elevated levels of IgA. Imaging studies and biopsies of affected tissues can provide additional diagnostic information
Treatment of HSP is generally supportive, focusing on hydration, pain relief, and nutrition.
corticosteroids may be used in severe cases or for significant gastrointestinal involvement.
Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and plasma exchange are occasionally employed for severe disease. Nephritis due to IgA vasculitis should be treated with immunosuppressants
like prednisolone and azathioprine. complications of HSP can include serious gastrointestinal
problems, kidney disease, and recurrences, but overall, the prognosis for childhood HSP is
favorable. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and urine is recommended to detect and manage potential complications.",5584-3562.PNG,B,
Q5,"A child in your unit is diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition (SAM). According to the wHO criteria, SAM is defined best by:","a)weight for age less than - 2SD
b)weight for height less than + 2SD
c)weight for age less than + 3SD
d)weight for height less than - 3SD","Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is best defined as weight for height less than median minus -3SD
Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in children of ages 6 to 59 months is defined by the WHO as any of the following:
• Weight-for-length (or height) below -3 SD of the median WHO child growth standards.
• Presence of bipedal edema
• Mid-upper arm circumference &lt;11.5 cm
Once the child is diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition, the doctor must assess for severe
edema (+++); low appetite (failed appetite test); medical complications (severe anemia,
pneumonia, diarrhea, dehydration, cerebral palsy, tuberculosis, HIV, heart disease, etc.) and one or more danger signs as per IMNcI
If any of the complications are present, the child is diagnosed with complicated SAM and is managed inpatient in the facility.
If the above-mentioned signs are absent, the child is diagnosed with uncomplicated
SAM and supervised management at home is given.",,D,
Q6,The most common manifestation of congenital toxoplasmosis is ______,"a)Hydrocephalus
b)chorioretinitis
c)Hepatosplenomegaly
d)Thrombocytopenia","chorioretinitis is the most common manifestation of congenital toxoplasmosis.



The characteristic triad of congenital toxoplasmosis is chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and diffuse intracranial calcifications. Clinical manifestations apart from the triad include hydrops fetalis,
intrauterine growth retardation, prematurity, peripheral retinal scars, persistent jaundice, and mild thrombocytopenia.
Congenital toxoplasmosis occurs when a pregnant woman acquires the infection during gestation. The organism may cross to the fetus transplacentally or at the time of vaginal delivery. The
severity of the disease in the neonate is greater if the woman gets infected early in her
pregnancy. The causative agent is Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular protozoan.
The diagnosis is made by the detection of IgM anti-toxoplasma antibodies. IgG can cross the
placenta is hence, cannot confirm infection in the infant. IgM immunosorbent agglutination assay (ISAGA) and IgA ELISA are the most useful diagnostic tests.
Spiramycin can be administered for cases of acute infection in early pregnancy to reduce vertical transmission. It does not cross the placenta and therefore cannot be used to treat an infected
fetus. Pyrimethamine-sulfonamide (to be avoided in the first trimester) is used when a fetal infection is confirmed or in maternal infections after 18 weeks.",,B,
Q7,Molecular defect causing liver disease in Dubin-Johnson syndrome is__________,"a)ATP7A
b)ATP7B
c)ABCC2
d)SERPINA 1","The molecular defect causing liver disease in Dubin–Johnson syndrome is ABCC2.
Dubin-Johnson syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder due to a defect in ABCC2. ABCC2 codes for canalicular protein with ATP-binding cassette. A defect in this gene leads to the
mutation of the multiple drug-resistant protein 2 (MRP2) receptor. This in turn leads to a defective transfer of conjugated bilirubin from the liver to bile.
It presents with abdominal pain, mild icterus, and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Biopsy shows black liver due to an accumulation of epinephrine metabolite.
Conditions causing conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are summarised in the table below:
Important diseases and their molecular defects:

Dubin-Johnson syndrome	Rotor syndrome
Autosomal recessive	Autosomal recessive
The absent function ofmultip le drug-resistant proteins (M  RP-2)	Defects in anion transport

Q8,where would you place the pulse oximeter to measure pre-ductal oxygen saturation in an infant who was born 3 minutes ago?,"a)Left upper limb
b)Left lower limb
c)Right upper limb
d)Right lower limb","The right upper limb is the best area to check pre-ductal oxygen saturation in a newborn infant as it receives blood supply primarily from the right brachial artery, which arises from the aorta
before the ductus arteriosus.
In routine neonatal screening for critical congenital heart diseases (CCHD), saturation probes are placed on the right upper limb (pre-ductal) and the right lower limb (post-ductal) respectively.
If the difference between pre-ductal and post-ductal saturation is more than five percent, it
confirms the presence of hypoxemia. Any reading showing an SpO2 &lt;9o% or greater than a three percent difference between the right hand and right foot for three successive readings
separated by an hour each would suggest the presence of a congenital cardiac disease.
Screening is done to identify critical conditions before they present symptomatically, and before     the neonate leaves the hospital post-delivery. This would allow for early and effective treatment of an underlying disease.
Critical congenital heart diseases include coarctation of the aorta, double outlet right ventricle, Ebstein anomaly, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, interrupted aortic arch, pulmonary atresia,  single ventricle, tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVC),  d-transposition of the great arteries (TGA), tricuspid atresia, and truncus arteriosus.",,C,
Q9,All among the following are clinical features of necrotizing enterocolitis except _________,"a)Vomiting
b)Abdominal mass
c)Erythema of the abdominal wall
d)Metabolic alkalosis","Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) can cause metabolic or respiratory acidosis (not alkalosis).
Acidosis can be attributed to sepsis, lactic acidosis due to decreased perfusion of the abdominal wall, decreased reabsorption of bicarbonate from the intestine, and reduced respiratory
compensation due to apnea.
NEC is the most common life-threatening gastrointestinal disorder in the newborn period. It is characterized by various degrees of mucosal or transmural inflammation and necrosis of the
intestinal tract. It most commonly affects the distal ileum and proximal colon.
Three major risk factors implicated are prematurity (greatest risk factor), formula feeding, and bacterial colonization of the intestine. Incidence and mortality increase with decreasing birth    weight and gestational age.



It usually presents within the 2nd or 3rd week of life with abdominal distension and tenderness, feed intolerance, and occult/gross blood in the stool. systemic features include hypotension,
bradycardia, lethargy, and temperature instability. other signs and symptoms include vomiting,  changes in stool pattern, abdominal mass, apnea, respiratory distress, hyponatremia, shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Diagnosis can be made with a plain abdominal X-ray. pneumatosis intestinalis (air in the bowel wall) is diagnostic. portal vein gas is a sign of severe disease. pneumoperitoneum indicates
perforation of the intestinal wall.
staging is done using the modified Bell's staging criteria:
Management of NEC includes supportive measures - nil per oral, nasogastric decompression,
intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and inotropic support if indicated. perforation is an absolute indication for surgery. The most effective preventive strategy is the use of human
milk. prebiotics and probiotics can be used with variable efficacy.
The images below show pneumatosis intestinalis (A), pneumoperitoneum (B), gasless abdomen
(C), and distention of the abdomen with periumbilical erythema (D):

Q10,The most common cause of HIV infection in a newborn is _________,"a)Perinatal transmission
b)Breast milk
c)Transplacental
d)Exchange transfusion with infected blood","The most common cause of HIV infection in a newborn is perinatal transmission. Around 7o to 8o% of affected children acquire the virus intrapartum.
The mechanism of perinatal transmission has been postulated to be mucosal exposure to infected blood and cervicovaginal secretions in the birth canal. The intrauterine contractions during active labor/delivery could also increase the risk of late micro transfusions.
Vertical transmission of HIV can occur in utero (during pregnancy), during delivery (perinatal), and after birth by breastfeeding (least common).
The risk factors for vertical transmission are high maternal viremia, preterm delivery (&lt;34    weeks), vitamin A deficiency, prolonged rupture of membranes (&gt;4 hours) low birth weight, and low maternal CD4 count.",,A,
Q11,which of the following is the main factor for the ductal closure postnatally?,"a)Increase in partial pressure of oxygen (pao2)
b)Increase in systemic vascular resistance
c)Increase in circulating prostaglandin levels
d)Decrease in pulmonary venous resistance","oxygen is the most important factor controlling ductal closure.





Gestational age also appears to play an important role; the ductus of a premature infant is less     responsive to oxygen, even though its musculature is developed. Hence, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is more common in premature infants.
The fetal circulatory adjustments after birth are given below:
The patency of ductus arteriosus may either provide an alternative route for blood to bypass congenital defects such as pulmonary atresia or coarctation of the aorta.
Therapeutic medications can be used to either maintain the patency (prostaglandin E1) or
promote closure (indomethacin). Drugs like indomethacin are not recommended during the third trimester of pregnancy.

Q12,cardiac edema and neuropathy are seen in which of the following vitamin deficiencies?,"a)Biotin
b)Thiamine
c)pyridoxine
d)Riboflavin","cardiac edema and neuropathy are associated with the deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1).
Early symptoms of thiamine deficiency include peripheral neuropathy, irritability, loss of deep  tendon reflexes, and proprioception. As the disease progresses, increased intracranial pressure, meningismus, and coma develop.
wet beriberi (cardiac) is associated with tachycardia, cardiomegaly, cardiac failure, and edema. It is commonly seen in the refugee camps where people consume polished rice based monotonous



diets. Diagnosis of thiamine deficiency can be established by erythrocyte transketolase activity assessment.
Dry beriberi is associated with neurological deficits such as optic atrophy, ataxia, and irritability. complications include lactic acidosis and wernicke encephalopathy.",,B,
Q13,The commonest indication for liver transplantation in children is ______,"a)Alagille syndrome
b)Biliary atresia
c)caroli disease
d)Hepatcellular carcinoma","Biliary atresia is the most common indication for liver transplantation in children.
Extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA) is defined as a partial or total absence of permeable bile duct between the porta hepatis and the duodenum. It is due to inflammatory fibrosis of the biliary
tree. It leads to obstruction to bile flow thereby causing the leaking of conjugated bilirubin into the circulation.
Infants have symptoms of jaundice, pale stools, and dark urine right after birth. In advanced   disease, infants present with failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, and ascites due to liver cirrhosis.
HIDA scan is the investigation of choice for extrahepatic biliary atresia. An intraoperative cholangiogram is a gold standard investigation for diagnosis.
children with biliary atresia, who do not achieve successful drainage after
hepatoportoenterostomy (kasai's procedure), require liver transplantation within the first year of life.

Q14,"while you are evaluating a baby, you show him a bright pink teddy bear, that he reaches out to with both hands. what is the earliest age by which this milestone is typically achieved?","a)4 months
b)5 months
c)6 months
d)7 months","The earliest age of appearance ofbidextrous reach is 4 months.
Fine motor reflexes begin to appear only after the palmar grasp reflex disappears at 3-4 months. The development of unidextrous reach occurs by 6 months of age.",,A,
Q15,"A baby assessed 5 minutes after birth, is found to be cyanosed with irregular gasping
respiration. Heart rate is 6o beats/min, and shows minimal response to stimulation with some flexion of extremities. The Apgar score for this newborn is ______","a)2
b)5
c)3
d)4","The Apgar score in this baby is 4. It is calculated as:



Appearance: blue - score o
pulse: &lt;1oo beats/min - score 1
Grimace: with minimal response to stimulation - score 1
Activity: some flexion of the extremities - score 1
Respiratory effort: irregular - score 1 The total score is 4.
Apgar score is not used to guide resuscitation, and resuscitation must be initiated before the
1-minute score. The change of score at sequential time points following birth reflects how well the baby is responding to resuscitative efforts.
causes for low Apgar score are:
• Fetal distress
• prematurity
• Drugs like analgesics, narcotics, sedatives, magnesium sulfate
• Acute cerebral trauma
• precipitous delivery
• Airway obstruction (choanal atresia)
• congenital pneumonia or sepsis
• Haemorrhage- hypovolemia
False-negative Apgar score is seen in maternal acidosis and high fetal catecholamine levels.
A total score of 1o indicates that the infant is in the best possible condition. An infant with a score of o-3 requires immediate resuscitation. If the score at 5 minutes remains less than 7, the infant     should be assessed again every 5 minutes for the next 2o minutes.",,D,5599-3568.PNG
Q16,Most common heart defect in congenital rubella syndrome is:,"a)ASD
b)VSD
c)PDA
d)PS","Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is the most common congenital heart disease associated with rubella, followed by pulmonary artery stenosis (Ps).
cardiac anomalies have been observed in 5o% of children infected during the first 8 weeks of  gestation. The incidence of heart disease in congenital rubella syndrome is: PDA &gt; Ps (right &gt;left) &gt; ventricular septal defect &gt; atrial septal defect.",,C,
Q17,which among the following options describes the chest x-ray image?,"a)Egg on string appearance
b)coeur en sabot
c)scimitar sign
d)snow man sign","The given chest x-ray shows 'coeur-en-sabot' or boot-shaped heart, which is seen in tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).
The characteristic silhouette is due to cardiac apex elevation as a result of right ventricular
hypertrophy. The hilar areas and lung fields are relatively clear because of diminished pulmonary blood flow or the small size of the pulmonary arteries and the aorta is usually enlarged.
The image below describes the likeness of the cardiac silhouette to a boot:


TOF is cyanotic congenital heart disease with the following four components:
• Obstruction to right ventricular outflow (pulmonary stenosis)
• Malalignment type of ventricular septal defect (VsD)
• Dextroposition of the aorta so that it overrides the ventricular septum (overriding of the aorta)
• Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)
The severity of symptoms depends on the degree of the right ventricular outflow obstruction. In mild degrees, the symptoms become pronounced as the baby grows due to RV infundibular
hypertrophy and may present with heart failure. In severe degrees, pulmonary blood flow
predominantly depends on the ductus arteriosus. As soon as the duct closes, the baby presents with cyanosis and circulatory collapse in the neonatal period.



clinical features include significant hypercyanotic spells in infants which are characterised by
hyperpnea, cyanosis, and gasping followed by syncope. The spells occur most frequently in the
morning on initially awakening or after episodes of vigorous crying. These spells are due to a
prolonged reduction of pulmonary blood flow resulting in severe systemic hypoxia and metabolic acidosis.
older children present with exertional dyspnea and assume a squatting position to relieve the dyspneic episode after which the child is able to resume the activity.",5587-3563.PNG,B,5600-3569.PNG
