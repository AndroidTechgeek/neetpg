Q1,Nude mice are not resistant to xenograft due to the absence of_______,"a)B cell
b)T cell
c)Both B and T cell
d)NK cell","Nude mice are not resistant to xenograft due to absence of T cell.
A xenograft is a tissue graft or organ transplant from a donor of a different species.
Nude mice lack body hair, hence the name. They lack a thymus and thus cannot generate mature T lymphocytes. The absence ofT-lymphocytes makes them unable to mount adaptive immune
responses requiring helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells. The absence of functioning T cells also prevents the rejection of allografts &amp; xenografts.",,B,
Q2,which of the following is Burkholderia cepacia resistant to?,"a)ceftazidime
b)Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
c)Temocillin
d)cefotetan","Burkholderia cepacia is resistant to cefotetan.
B. cepacia complex strains are intrinsically resistant to aminoglycosides, polymixin, first and
second-generation cephalosporins (e.g. cefotetan) and carboxypenicillins. This antimicrobial
resistance is mediated by efflux pumps, antimicrobial degradation, modifying enzymes or altered

membrane functions.
B. cepacia is a Gram-negative bacillus which can cause severe necrotizing pneumonia in patients    with chronic granulomatous disease. It can lead to fatal septicemia in patients with cystic fibrosis.
Antimicrobial agents that are effective against B. cepacia complex include meropenem,
ceftazidime, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin and temocillin.",,D,
Q3,which of the following organisms causes scombroid fish poisoning?,"a)salmonella
b)staphylococcus
c)pseudomonas aeruginosa
d)peptostreptococcus","scombroid fish poisoning is associated with pseudomonas aeruginosa.
It follows the consumption of both scombroid (mackerel-like) fish and nonscombroid fish that
have not been refrigerated properly. The musculature of these dark- or red-fleshed fish undergoes decomposition by Morganella morganii, Escherichia coli, proteus species, klebsiella species, and   pseudomonas aeruginosa. There is consequent decarboxylation of the amino acid L-histidine to
form histamine.
A second compound is thought to play a causative role in this intoxication because large doses of   oral histamine do not reproduce the affliction. The toxin or toxins involved are heat stable and are not destroyed by cooking or freezing.
symptoms develop within 15–9o min of ingestion. Most cases are mild, with tingling of lips and mouth, mild abdominal discomfort, and nausea. The more severe and commonly described
presentation includes flushing, conjunctival hyperemia, pruritus, urticaria, and
angioedema. without treatment, the symptoms generally resolve within 8–12 h.",,C,
Q4,which of the following is the predominant pathogen to infect renal transplant recipients one to four months following transplantation?,"a)cytomegaloVirus
b)Jc Virus
c)BK Virus
d)Epstein-Barr Virus","The predominant pathogen to infect renal transplant recipients in the period around 1 to 4 months following the transplantation is cytomegalovirus (CMV).
CMV is the most common virus to affect recipients after organ transplantation (kidney, heart,
lung etc). The maximal risk occurs between 1 and 4 months after transplantation (in the absence    of prophylaxis). The most common CMV presentation in kidney transplant patients includes fever, leukopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, myalgia, and arthralgia. Antiviral prophylaxis with ganciclovir     or valganciclovir is used in renal transplant recipients whenever indicated to prevent CMV
disease.
Given below are the most common opportunistic infections in renal transplant recipients:

peritransplant (less than 1 m onth)	Early (1-6 months)	Late (more than 6 months)
wound infectionHerpes virus oral candidiasisurinary tract  infection	pneumocystis jiroveciCytome galovirusHepatitis BListeria	AspergillusNocardiaBk Virus (polyoma)Herpes zoster",,A,
Q5,sabin-Feldman dye test is used for diagnosis of which of the following condition?,"a)paragonimiasis
b)Hydatid cyst
c)Toxoplasmosis
d)cryptococcus","sabin-Feldman dye test is used for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis.
It is based on the principle that the presence of anti-toxoplasma antibodies in the patient's
serum inhibits the staining of trophozoites by alkaline methylene blue dye. Toxoplasma
trophozoites and complement are added to the patient's serum which is then incubated for an hour at 37°c. After incubation, methylene blue dye is added.
• If anti-toxoplasma antibodies are present in the serum, these are activated by complement and the parasite membrane is lysed. Thus, the trophozoites are not stained (positive result).
• If there are no antibodies, trophozoites will take up the stain and appear blue under the microscope (negative result).
The dilution of the test serum at which 5o% of the tachyzoites are not stained is reported as the antibody titer of the test serum. The test is highly sensitive and specific. However, it cannot
differentiate between recent or past infections as it detects only IgG antibodies.",,C,
Q6,which of the following is called as Australia antigen?,"a)HBsAg
b)HBeAg
c)HBcAg
d)HBV-DNA","HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen) is also known as the Australia antigen. It is called so because it was first isolated from the serum of an Australian person.
sera from hepatitis B patients when observed under an electron microscope show three types of particles:
• A spherical particle: 22nm, most abundant, contains only HBsAg.
• Filamentous or tubular particle: 22nm, contains only HBsAg.
• A double-walled spherical structure: 42nm diameter, is the complete Hepatitis B virus. It was described by Dane and is called Dane particle.",,A,1450-883.PNG
Q7,Bacterial transduction occurs by,"a)plasmids
b)sex pili
c)Bacteriophage
d)uptake of genetic material by other bacteria.","Bacterial transduction occurs by bacteriophages.
Transduction is a process of acquiring bacterial DNA from a bacteriophage (virus) that has incorporated bacterial DNA from previous host bacteria.
other methods of exchange of genetic material are transformation and
conjugation. Transformation involves the uptake of genetic material from the environment, which is released by other bacteria. conjugation is the direct transfer of DNA from one bacterial cell to    another bacterial cell through a sex pilus or bridge. The transferred DNA is a plasmid, a circle of   DNA that is distinct from the main bacterial chromosome.",,C,1451-884.PNG
Q8,which fungus is most commonly associated with orbital cellulitis in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis ?,"a)candida
b)Rhizopus
c)Aspergillus
d)Trichophyton","Rhizopus is the most common fungus associated with orbital cellulitis in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis.
Diabetic patients are immunocompromised and so prone to develop opportunistic infections like mucormycosis - caused by Rhizopus and Mucor spp. Rhino-orbital- cerebral disease is the most
common form of mucormycosis. It mostly occurs in diabetics. patients initially present with eye or facial pain, facial numbness, conjunctival suffusion and swelling, and blurry vision. Infection then spreads from the ethmoid sinus to the orbit, leading to proptosis and orbital cellulitis.
Rhizopus is angioinvasive, and thus the infection may spread to the frontal lobe and cavernous
sinus, leading to septicemia and thromboses. The sinus tissue in such patients often develops into a black necrotic eschar.",,B,
Q9,The adult form of echinococcus is seen in which of the following?,"a)Dog
b)cat
c)swine
d)sheep","The adult form of echinococcus is seen in dogs and other canids, which are its definitive hosts.

The larval stage is passed in intermediate hosts such as sheep, cattle, goat, swine, horses, camels, and man. Man acts as an accidental intermediate host (dead end). Human infection follows the     ingestion of eggs due to the intimate handling of dogs or by eating raw vegetables or other food    contaminated with dog feces.
Note: Humans can become accidental definitive hosts, second intermediate hosts, or paratenic
hosts for spirometra. These are cestodes belonging to the Diphyllobothriidae family. They cause a condition called sparagnosis.

Q12,TB test done only on whole blood sample is ___________.,"a)TrueNat TB
b)Gene xpert
c)Interferon gamma release assay
d)All the above","TB test done on a whole blood sample is the interferon-gamma release assay. It has been used for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis in patients with HIV(who frequently have a negative Mantoux test).
Interferon-gamma release assays include:
• QuantiFERON-TB Gold
• T-SpOT.TB
QuantiFERON-TB Gold quantitates the amount of IFN-γ produced by CD4+ T cells in response to the antigens from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. QuantiFERON-TB Gold plus (QFT- plus) is an
improved version of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. QuantiFERON-TB Gold detects only
TB-specific CD4+ responses. However, QuantiFeron-TB Gold plus detects both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses to TB-specific antigens.
T-SpOT.TB determines the total number of individual effector T cells expressing IFN-γ.
The TrueNat TB test is a new molecular test that can diagnose TB in one hour as well as test for
rifampicin resistance. This test uses a sputum sample taken from the patient. Only about o.5 ml of the sample is required. Gene xpert is also a molecular method of testing that cannot use blood as   a sample. (Option A and B)",,C,
Q13,"Multiple abscesses with discharging sinuses, demonstrating sulphur granules in pus, are caused by","a)Actinomyces
b)Nocardia
c)salmonella
d)Tularemia","Multiple abscesses with discharging sinuses, demonstrating sulfur granules in pus, are
characteristic of actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces.
Actinomycosis is a chronic granulomatous infection characterized by indurated swellings in the connective tissue with suppuration and discharge of sulfur granules. The most common causative agent is Actinomyces israelli.
Various clinical forms of actinomycosis include cervicofacial, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic     actinomycosis. Among them, oral-cervicofacial actinomycosis is most common, presenting as a soft tissue swelling, abscess, or mass lesion involving the angle of the jaw.",,A,
