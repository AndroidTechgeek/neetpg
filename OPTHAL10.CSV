Q1,what is the action of the superior oblique muscle?,"a)Intorsion, abduction, depression
b)Intorsion, adduction, elevation
c)Extorsion, abduction, depression
d)Extorsion, adduction, elevation","The actions carried out by the superior oblique muscle are intorsion, depression, and abduction.
There are six extraocular muscles for each eye. Four rectus muscles namely - superior, inferior, medial, and lateral recti. The oblique muscles are two - superior oblique and inferior oblique.



These muscles are responsible for the movements of the eye which can be either unilateral or binocular movements.
The superior oblique muscle originates from the apex of the orbit, turns around the trochlea, and inserts into the sclera behind the equator. The oblique direction of the tendon is responsible for    its rotatory effect (intorsion), in addition to depression and abduction.


unilateral movements (ductions) are :
1.Adduction: It is the movement towards the nasal side around the vertical axis.
2.Abduction: It is the movement towards the temporal side around the vertical axis.
3.supraduction (elevation): It is upward movement around the horizontal axis.
4.Infraduction (depression): It is downward movement around the horizontal axis.
5.Intorsion (medial rotation): Rotatory movement along the anteroposterior axis where the superior pole of cornea moves medially.
6.Extorsion (lateral rotation): Rotatory movement along the anteroposterior axis where the superior pole of cornea moves laterally.
Binocular movements can be of two types - versions and vergences.
The oculomotor nerve supplies all the extraocular muscles except the superior oblique and lateral  rectus. The superior oblique muscle is supplied by the trochlear nerve and lateral rectus muscle by the abducent nerve.",,A,3079-1881.PNG;3080-1882.PNG
Q2,which of the following triad is seen after an acute attack of angle-closure glaucoma?,"a)vogt's triad
b)virchow triad
c)Hutchinson's triad
d)Gaucher triad","vogt's triad is seen after an acute attack of primary angle-closure. It includes glaukomflecken, patches of iris atrophy, and a slightly dilated nonreactive pupil. Glaukomflecken is used to
describe an anterior subcapsular lenticular opacity. The slightly dilated pupil is attributed to sphincter atrophy.
Glaucoma is used to describe a group of conditions where there is progressive optic neuropathy with irreversible visual field defects associated with raised intraocular pressure. It can be
classified into congenital/developmental glaucomas, primary adult glaucomas, and secondary adult glaucomas. Primary adult glaucomas are of three types:
• Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)
• Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG)
• Primary mixed mechanism glaucoma.
In primary angle-closure disease, there is apposition of the peripheral iris with the trabecular
meshwork. This interferes with the drainage of aqueous humor. It is seen more commonly in
elderly females. Anatomical risk factors include hypermetropic eyes, anteriorly placed iris-lens
diaphragm, and a narrow-angle of the anterior chamber. The international society of geographical and epidemiological opthalmology (ISGEO) has classified primary angle-closure disease into three types.
• Primary angle-closure suspect (PACS)
• Primary angle-closure (PAC)
• Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG).
PACS and PAC are seen before the development of PACG. vogt triad is seen after an acute attack of PAC.



PAC includes irido-trabecular contact on gonioscopy and elevated intraocular pressure (IoP)
and/or peripheral anterior synechiae. The optic disc and visual fields are usually normal. Due to any reason, there can be an acute rise of IoP in patients with PAC. It is a vision-threatening
emergency and the sequelae of which can be ciliary body shut down, vogt's triad, and rarely spontaneous angle reopening.
other options:
option B - virchow triad is used to describe the abnormalities that result in thrombosis. These include endothelial injury, abnormal blood flow, and hypercoagulability of the blood.
option C - Hutchinson triad is used to describe manifestations of congenital syphilis. It includes interstitial keratitis, Hutchinson teeth, and eighth nerve deafness. Hutchinson teeth are
screw-driver or peg shaped small incisors.
option D - Gaucher's triad is not a named triad. Hypertonia, strabismus, and stridor usually point to a diagnosis of type 2 Gaucher's disease.",,A,
Q3,In which of the following conditions do you see punched-out lesions of the retina?,"a)posterior staphyloma
b)Fundal coloboma
c)congenital rubella
d)Toxoplasmosis","Toxoplasmosis characteristically causes punched-out lesions in the retina.
Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infestation due to Toxoplasma gondii. It primarily affects the central nervous system and retina. In humans, it occurs as congenital, acquired, or recurrent.
Congenital toxoplasmosis is acquired by the transplacental route. Infants are usually born with
inactive disease. Bilateral healed punched-out chorioretinal lesions in the macular area are usually seen. In acquired toxoplasmosis, punched-out lesions similar to congenital toxoplasmosis are
seen. In addition, punctate outer retinal toxoplasmosis (PoRT) may also be seen.


other options:
option A - Posterior staphyloma is used to describe a bulge in the sclera with the choroid behind the equator. on ophthalmoscopy, there is an excavated area with retinal vessels dipping in it.



option B - Fundal coloboma occurs due to a defect in the closure of the embryonic cleft. It appears as a comet-shaped defect with the apex towards the disc which may or may not be involved. A few choroidal or retinal vessels may also be seen on the surface.
option C - Congenital rubella typically produces a salt and pepper appearance of the fundus.",,D,3081-1883.PNG
Q4,which of the following has familial inheritance?,"a)1, 2, 3, 4
b)1, 2, 3
c)1, 3
d)3, 4","All the above conditions (1, 2, 3, 4) have a familial inheritance.
Retinoblastoma is a malignancy arising from the retina more commonly seen in children. 1o% of the cases are familial. These cases have an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The
remaining 9o% occurs sporadically. The clinical presentation includes leucocoria, strabismus, and painful red eye.
Retinitis pigmentosa is a pigmental retinal dystrophy where the photoreceptors, especially rods    are affected. Around 5o - 6o% of the cases have a familial inheritance. It has multiple modes of   inheritance, autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked recessive. Night blindness is a characteristic feature. Tubular vision is seen in advanced cases.
Myopia (shortsightedness) is a refractive error in which the light rays from infinity are focused in front of the retina. It is proven to have familial inheritance. Features include defective vision,
impaired night vision, and muscae volitantes.
primary open-angle glaucoma has a normal anterior chamber angle. Family history is a risk factor implicated in the condition. symptoms include headache, scotoma, and delayed dark adaptation.",,A,
Q5,"A 45-year-old man presented with lagophthalmos, orbicularis oculi palsy, and loss of corneal sensation. which of the following is the most likely causative organism?","a)Acanthamoeba castellanii
b)Mycobacterium leprae
c)onchocerca volvulus
d)Chlamydia A to C","Mycobacterium leprae is the most likely causative organism based on the clinical features given which points to ocular manifestations of leprosy. These include corneal anesthesia,
lagophthalmos, corneal ulceration, episcleritis, and iris atrophy. patients can also present with cataract, glaucoma, and madarosis.
Lagophthalmos is the inability to close the eyelids. This can be due to the involvement of the zygomatic branch of the facial nerve (as in leprosy). other causes of lagophthalmos include    extreme proptosis and symblepharon. The decreased corneal sensation seen is due to the
involvement of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve which innervates the cornea.
other options:
option A - Acanthamoeba castellanii can lead to acanthamoeba keratitis which presents with pain, lacrimation, photophobia, and foreign body sensation. It results from direct corneal contact with    infected material. Contact lens users are at an increased risk. Radial keratoneuritis is
pathognomonic.
option C - onchocerca volvulus causes onchocerciasis commonly seen in African countries.
symptoms include sclerosing keratitis, uveitis, chorioretinitis, and optic neuritis. ultimately it can lead to optic atrophy.



Option D - chlamydia trachomatis serovars A, B, Ba, and c are responsible hyperendemic
(blinding) trachoma. The source of infection is infected conjunctival discharge. If there is no
secondary bacterial infection, symptoms include lacrimation, scanty mucoid discharge and foreign body sensation. conjunctival congestion and follicles, papillary hyperplasia, Herbert follicles (seen in the limbal area), and progressive pannus are the characteristic features. serovars D to K causes  neonatal and adult inclusion conjunctivitis. Neonates present with conjunctival discharge,
chemosis and swollen lids. Adult inclusion conjunctivitis more commonly seen in sexually active adults present with foreign body sensation, mild photophobia, and mucopurulent discharge.",,B,
Q6,"A 27-year-old female patient presents with sudden diminishing vision associated with relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. on examination, the left eye is normal. which of the following investigations would you do next?","a)1, 2, and 3
b)1 and 2
c)2 and 3
d)3 and 4","The clinical vignette is suggestive of optic neuritis. sudden, progressive, and profound visual loss associated with relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) is characteristic of optic neuritis. MRI
brain &amp; orbit, screening for circulating myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) &amp;     neuromyelitis optica (NMO) antibodies, and blood sugar levels are the next best investigations for optic neuritis.
A brain MRI is recommended in every patient after the first attack of optic neuritis. The 15-year cumulative probability of developing multiple sclerosis after an attack of optic neuritis is about   5o%. It may remain an isolated event in some patients.
Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a severe type of optic neuritis which may occur bilaterally and is associated with myelitis. Detection of antibodies like MOG &amp; NMO (also known as
aquaporin-4 antibody) is diagnostic of the condition.
Optic neuritis is primarily treated with steroids. The blood sugar levels must be checked as steroids can worsen the glycemic control in individuals with DM which may precipitate
hyperglycemia.
Optic neuritis comprises inflammatory and demyelinating disorders of the optic nerve. It can be idiopathic, hereditary (Leber's disease), or due to demyelinating disorders such as multiple
sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica (Devic's disease). Anatomically, it can be papillitis, neuroretinitis, or retrobulbar neuritis. It is more common in women.
Other symptoms include lowered dark adaptation and visual obscuration in bright light. Transient obscuration of vision on exposure to light (uhthoff's symptom) and impaired depth perception
(Pulfrich's phenomenon) may also be seen.
Marcus Gunn pupil which points to RAPD is a characteristic sign. It is elicited by the swinging   flashlight test. One eye is illuminated with the flashlight and the response is noted. The same is done for the other eye. This is repeated multiple times (swinging). The normal response is
constriction in both eyes. If there is RAPD in one eye, it will dilate when light is shone on it.",,A,3084-1884.PNG
Q7,which of the following is not a feature of the optic disc in glaucoma?,"a)Roenne's nasal step
b)Bayonetting
c)Increased cup-disc ratio
d)Baring of nasal arteries","Roenne's nasal step is not a feature of the optic disc in glaucoma.
Roenne's nasal step is a visual field defect. It is the result of two arcuate scotomas running in different arcs and meeting at the horizontal meridian. This forms a right-angled defect in the nasal side of the visual field.
Early glaucomatous changes of the optic disc include an increase in cup-disc ratio (C/D ratio)  to more than o.4, splinter hemorrhages near the optic disc margin, and atrophy of the retinal nerve fiber layer.
Advanced glaucomatous changes of the optic disc include a marked increase in C/D ratio (o.7 or more), thinning of the neuroretinal rim, nasal shifting of the retinal vessels or bayonetting, and  pulsations of retinal arterioles at the disc margin.
If the damage progresses, all neural tissue is destroyed and the optic nerve appears white and deeply excavated.",,A,
Q8,A farmer presents with pain and discharge in his left eye. He says that he sustained an injury caused by a leaf a few days back. what is the finding seen in the image?,"a)Hyphema
b)Aqueous flare
c)Arlt line
d)Hypopyon","The finding seen in the image is hypopyon.
Hypopyon is a purulent whitish exudate consisting of inflammatory cells in the inferior part of the anterior chamber. It can be associated with bacterial or fungal corneal
ulcers and HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis.
In bacterial corneal ulcers, the hypopyon is sterile. In these lesions, the outpouring of
polymorphonuclear cells is due to the toxins and not due to actual invasion by bacteria. The hypopyon is absorbed when the ulcerative process is controlled.



In fungal corneal ulcers, the hypopyon is not sterile. The fungi can penetrate into the anterior chamber without perforation.
The hypopyon associated with anterior uveitis is immobile due to high fibrin content. In Behcet disease, there is minimal fibrin content, so the hypopyon shifts according to the patient’s head   position.
Treatment of hypopyon involves correcting the underlying conditions.
other options:
option A: Hyphema is a hemorrhage in the anterior chamber. It commonly occurs after a blunt ocular injury. The bleeding is from the iris root or ciliary body face. The blood settles inferiorly  forming a fluid level.
option B: Aqueous flare refers to the haziness of the normally clear fluid in the anterior chamber. It reflects the presence of protein due to the breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier. The
presence of flare indicates active inflammation.
option C: Arlt line is the scarring on the conjunctiva in the area of sulcus subtarsalis. It can be a single line, irregularly shaped, or star-shaped. Common causes are trachoma, healed traumatic   wounds, or surgical scars.",3074-1879.PNG,D,
Q9,what is the most common cause of moderate-severe visual impairment according to the National Blindness and visual Impairment survey 2015-19?,"a)Refractive error
b)untreated cataract
c)Glaucoma
d)Diabetic retinopathy","According to the National Blindness and Visual Impairment Survey 2o15-19, the most common cause of moderate-severe visual impairment (MSVI) is untreated cataract.
MSVI is defined as presenting visual acuity of &lt;6/18 to 3/6o in the better eye with available correction.
Most commonly, cases of visual impairment and blindness are more prevalent in patients aged 5o years and above.
other options:
option A: Refractive errors are the leading cause of MSVI in patients aged 49 years and below.
options C and D: Glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy account for a very low number of visual impairment cases in patients aged 5o years and above.",,B,
Q10,which of the following statements is true about optic neuritis?,"a)Relative afferent pupillary defect is seen.
b)There is no pain on ocular movement.
c)Multiple myeloma is a common cause.
d)oral corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment.","In optic neuritis, relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) or Marcus Gunn pupil is seen. It is
elicited by the swinging flashlight test. Normally, both pupils remain constricted. In the presence of RAPD, both pupils dilate on moving the flashlight from the normal to the abnormal eye. This   paradoxical response of the pupil to light is called Marcus Gunn pupil.
other options:
option B: Pain is aggravated by ocular movement, especially in the upward or downward direction due to attachment of the superior rectus fibers to the dura mater.



option C: Multiple sclerosis, and not multiple myeloma, is a known demyelinating cause of optic neuritis.
option D: oral corticosteroid therapy alone is contraindicated because it does not improve the   outcome and is associated with an increased risk of new attacks of optic neuritis. Intravenous     methylprednisolone can be used if the patient shows radiological evidence of multiple sclerosis.",,A,
Q11,The most common ocular manifestation of cOVID-19 is _______.,"a)uveitis
b)Mucormycosis
c)Follicular conjunctivitis
d)papillary conjunctivitis","The most common ocular manifestation of CoVID-19 is follicular conjunctivitis.
Hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, dry eye disease, episcleritis, chemosis, and photophobia may also occur, but less frequently.
The most prevalent ocular symptoms are dry eye or foreign body sensation, redness, tearing, itching, eye pain, and discharge.
Intraocular complications include retinal artery occlusions and hemorrhages, in addition to cotton-wool spots caused by complement-mediated thrombotic angiopathy.
The ACE-2 receptors present in the cornea and conjunctiva make the ocular surface a potential target tissue for SARS-CoV-2.
Sometimes, conjunctivitis may appear as the only sign and symptom of CoVID-19. Patients should, therefore, undergo a nasopharyngeal RT-PCR test.",,C,
Q12,Identify the condition given in the image.,"a)symblepharon
b)Ankyloblepharon
c)congenital blepharophimosis
d)congenital ptosis","The condition given in the image is ankyloblepharon. It is the adhesion between the margins of the upper and lower eyelids.
It may occur as a congenital anomaly or as acquired adhesions after healing of chemical burns, ulcers, or traumatic wounds of the lid margins.
Treatment is the excision of the adhesions between lid margins. Epithelial grafts should be used if adhesions extend to angles.
other options:
option A: Symblepharon is the adhesion between the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva in which the eyelids become adherent to the eyeball.
The image given below shows symblepharon.





option c: congenital blepharophimosis is a condition in which the extent of the palpebral fissure is decreased. It can be congenital or acquired and is due to a vertical skin fold at the lateral
canthus. No treatment is required. In some cases, canthoplasty is done.
option D: congenital ptosis is associated with developmental defect and weakness of the levator palpebrae superioris (LPS) muscle. Drooping of one or both of the upper eyelids is seen since
birth. Lid lag on downward gaze is present. Treatment involves surgical correction.",3075-1880.PNG,B,3087-1885.PNG
Q13,Match the following:,"a)1-d, 2-b, 3-a, 4-c

c)1-b, 2-a, 3-d, 4-c
d)1-d, 2-c, 3-a, 4-b","The correct option is option c: 1-b, 2-a, 3-d, 4-c.
color vision is tested with Ishihara plates, which is a pseudoisochromatic chart. There are
patterns of colored and grey dots that reveal one pattern to persons with normal color vision and another to those with the color deficiency.
The below image shows Ishihara chart.






An applanation tonometer is used to measure the intraocular pressure. It is based on the    Imbert-Fick law, which states that the pressure inside a sphere(p) is equal to the force (W) required to flatten its surface divided by the area of flattening (A).
p 〓 W/A
The following is an image ofthe applanation tonometer:


perimetry is the procedure of estimating the extent of the visual fields. There are 2 types of perimetry: kinetic and static perimetry.
In kinetic perimetry, a target of given luminance is moved from a non-seeing area in the periphery towards the center, where it is perceived. In the static method, the location of a stimulus remains   fixed, with the intensity increased until it is seen by the subject (threshold is reached) or
decreased until it is no longer detected.
The tangent screen perimetry evaluates the central 3o degrees field at 1 m, thereby testing the central vision.",,C,3088-1887.PNG;3088-1886.PNG
Q14,In which of the following is atropine contraindicated?,"a)Acute congestive glaucoma
b)Acute anterior uveitis
c)Malignant glaucoma
d)corneal ulcer","Atropine is contraindicated in acute congestive glaucoma.
Acute congestive or angle closure glaucoma is caused by the opposition of the peripheral iris
against the trabecular meshwork. This obstructs the aqueous outflow by closing an already
narrow-angle of the anterior chamber leading to an acute increase in intraocular pressure(IOP). It can be precipitated by dim light, mydriatics like atropine.
It presents as sudden onset of severe unilateral eye pain or a headache associated with blurred     vision, rainbow-colored halos around bright lights, nausea, and vomiting. The physical exam will reveal a fixed midpoint pupil and a hazy or cloudy cornea with marked conjunctival injection.
Management of acute condition includes rapid lowering of IOP by mannitol or glycerol, acetazolamide, and topical antiglaucoma drugs. Definitive management is done by laser peripheral iridotomy or filtration surgery.
Atropine is indicated as cycloplegic to reduce pain and prevent synechiae in corneal ulcers and acute anterior uveitis. It is the initial management in malignant glaucoma.",,A,
Q15,what is the mechanism of action when the retina is exposed to light?,"a)Hyperpolarization, decrease in neurotransmitter release
b)Depolarization, decrease in neurotransmitter release
c)Depolarization, increase in neurotransmitter release","The exposure of the retina to light causes hyperpolarization and a decreased release of
neurotransmitters in rods and cones.
when photoreceptors are exposed to light, a series of biochemical reactions result in the
generation of electrical charge. This phenomenon of conversion of light energy into electrical impulse is known as phototransduction.
In dark, cyclic GMP (cGMP) gated channels are open leading to a steady release of
neurotransmitters (glutamate). when light falls on the retina,11-cis-retinal is converted to
all-trans-retinal. This activates transducin which is a g protein-coupled receptor with
phosphodiesterase activity breaking down cGMP. with a decrease in cGMP levels sodium
channels close causing hyperpolarization. Hyperpolarization reduces glutamate release, which leads to the formation of the action potential.",,B,3090-1889.PNG;3090-1888.PNG
Q16,which of the following is not a feature ofkeratoconus?,"a)Haab's striae
b)Munson's sign
c)Irregular astigmatism
d)scissoring reflex","The incorrect about keratoconus is Haabls striae. Haabls striae are seen in cases of
buphthalmos where the intraocular pressure is raised and the eyeball is enlarged as a whole. The enlarged cornea is associated with tears in Descemetls membrane called Haabls striae.
keratoconus or the conical cornea is a bilateral non-inflammatory progressive condition of the
axial part of the cornea. central or paracentral thinning of the cornea and apical protrusion of the anterior cornea are pathognomonic. This is attributed to mucopolysaccharide and collagen tissue  synthesis defects.





clinical features of the condition include defective vision due to progressive myopia and irregular astigmatism. Light sensitivity and ocular irritation may also be present. complications include
acute hydrops following the rupture of Descemet's membrane.
slit-lamp examination reveals Fleischer's ring at the base of the cone formed. Deep, vertical
stromal striae (vogt lines) that disappear with external pressure are characteristic. Retinoscopy shows a scissoring reflex. The bulging of the lower lid in the downgaze, called Munson's sign, is shown in the image below.


The severity of the condition is graded based on keratometry. corneal topography is a diagnostic modality with the highest sensitivity for early cases.
Intacs or intracorneal ring segments are useful in moderate cases due to their flattening effect. Rigid gas-permeable contact lenses, corneal collagen cross-linking with riboflavin, and
keratoplasty are the other treatment modalities.",,A,3091-1891.PNG;3091-1890.PNG
Q17,A patient has presented for a routine eye evaluation. You have checked his visual acuity using snellen's chart and found it to be 6/6. what is the minimum angle of resolution?,"a)15 minutes of arc
b)5 minutes of arc
c)1o minutes of arc
d)2o minute of arc","The angle subtended for a patient with 6/6 vision is 5 minutes of arc.
visual acuity is a measure of the spatial resolution of the eye or an estimation of its ability to discriminate between two points.
snellen's chart consists of a series of letters arranged in lines, each diminishing in size.
Each whole letter will subtend an
the angle of 5 minutes at the nodal point of the eye at the given distance.
In the snellen chart, the largest letter will subtend an angle of 5 minutes at the nodal point if it is 6o m from the eye. Those in the subsequent lines will subtend an angle of 5 minutes if they are
36, 24, 18, 12, 9, and 6 m from the eye.
The patient is placed at 6 m and asked to read the visual acuity chart from the largest letters
downwards to the smallest that can be visualized with each eye separately. A person with normal 6/6 vision sitting at a distance of 6 m from the types should be able to read every letter from the   top to the end of the 6 m line. so the angle subtended by the 6 m line at the eye a distance of 6     meters will be 5 minutes of arc.
If a patient can only read up to the 12m line, his distant vision is defective. His visual acuity will be recorded as 6/12. The numerator denotes the distance at which the patient is able to read the particular line and the denominator denotes the distance at which a person with normal visual   acuity will be able to read the given line.",,B,Picture29.png
Q18,which of the following is not a feature of pterygium?,"a)Rate of recurrence is 95%
b)It is a fibrovascular growth
c)The parts of a pterygium are head, neck and body
d)Has progressive and regressive types","The recurrence rate of 95% is not a feature of pterygium. The recurrence rate of pterygium is around 8o% after simple surgical excision.
pterygium is a wing-shaped, triangular fibrovascular ingrowth (option B) of degenerative
conjunctival tissue that can encroach onto the cornea. It is a response to prolonged exposure to



ultraviolet rays, dry heat, etc. It has 3 parts mainly, a head (apical part on the cornea), a body (the region between the limbus and canthus), and a cap(semilunar white infiltrate in front of the
head)(option C).. some authors mention the neck as the constricted part near the limbal area. patients may complain of itching and grittiness due to Dellen (localized drying effect). If the     pterygium encroaches onto the pupillary area, it may interfere with vision and also induce
astigmatism. stocker's line may be associated with a pterygium. It is a
linear deposition of iron seen in the corneal epithelium, anterior to the head of a pterygium. pterygium is of 2 types (option D):
• progressive which is thick, fleshy, and vascular.
• Regressive which is thin, atrophic, and attenuated.
This condition can be treated symptomatically with tear substitutes for dry eye symptoms and patients are advised to avoid ultraviolet rays. surgical excision with free conjunctival limbal
autograft is the preferred treatment to avoid recurrence.
The recurrence rate of pterygium is around 8o% after simple surgical excision. Excision together with adjunctive therapies such as mitomycin C or 5-fluorouracil can reduce the risk of recurrence to approximately 1o%
The image below shows a pterygium.",,A,3093-1892.PNG
Q19,which of the following is not a feature of complicated cataracts?,"a)krukenberg spindle
b)Polychromatic lusture
c)occurs after uveitis
d)Breadcrumb appearance","krukenberg spindle is not a feature of complicated cataracts. The slit lamp examination in pigmentary glaucoma shows a pattern of pigment deposition on the back of the
cornea-endothelium called krukenberg spindles.
Complicated or secondary cataracts develop secondary to inflammatory/degenerative conditions of the lens or other parts of the eye like iridocyclitis and ciliary body tumors which lead to
disturbances in the nutrition of the lens. These cataracts present with a breadcrumb appearance and polychromatic luster.



Even in the early stages, vision is impaired. Inflammation of the posterior segment leads to the characteristic posterior subcapsular cataract while the anterior segment inflammation causes     opacification throughout the cortex.",,A,
Q20,oculocephalic reflex assesses the integrity of which of the following cranial nerves?,"a)A and C
b)A and E
c)A and D
d)A, C, and D","The oculocephalic reflex or doll's eye reflex is used to assess the integrity of the cranial nerves III, VI, and VIII.
It is a brainstem reflex examined by observing the the motion of eyes during the sudden rotation of the head of the patient by the examiner. It is done in both directions laterally, followed by
flexion and extension. In a normal positive reflex, the eyes move conjugately in the opposite direction of the movement of the head to maintain their position in space.
The reflex has afferents in the vestibular nerve (VIII) that relay to the brainstem nuclei and bring about conjugate eye movements through the oculomotor nerve (III) and abducens nerve (VI).
A negative reflex occurs in any of the above cranial nerve palsies or brainstem injuries, where the eyes show no movement or movement in the same direction as head movement. This is used to    assess brainstem reflexes in a comatose patient as a criterion of brain death.",,D,
Q21,"A pregnant woman presents with fever, retroorbital pain, headache, pulsatile proptosis of the right eye, and tinnitus. BP and fundus were normal. which of the following structures are
involved?","a)A,B,C
b)B,C,D
c)A,C,D
d)A,B,C,D","The structures affected in this patient are A, B, C and D.
Cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is a septic thrombus formed in the cavernous sinus. It spreads from infection of the sinuses, teeth, ears, nose, and skin of the face.
It presents as fever, severe headache, supraorbital pain, seizures, and edema in the mastoid
region. Eye signs include proptosis, chemosis, and diplopia due to ophthalmoplegia from the
involvement of oculomotor (CN-III), trochlear (CN-IV), and abducens nerve (CN-VI). Absence of corneal sensation due to the involvement of the ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve
(CN-Va). Ipsilateral ptosis, dilated pupil, and absence of direct and consensual pupillary right reflex due to oculomotor nerve palsy. pulsatile proptosis occurs with the involvement of the    internal carotid artery.
Investigation using brain magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic resonance venography should  be done urgently. Following early diagnosis, management of cavernous sinus thrombosis typically includes intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and
anticoagulants.",,D,3095-1893.PNG
