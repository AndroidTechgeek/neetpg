Q1,"A 25-year-old lady had an uneventful vaginal delivery. on postpartum day 1, she presented  with postpartum haemorrhage and complains of visual changes and severe headache. A few hours after the complaint, she is found to be in an unresponsive state and is intubated and   put on ventilation. on further examination, she has a BP of 6o/4o mmHg and tachycardia,  blood sugar is 48 mg/dL. Hematocrit and wBC count was normal. which of the following     drugs would help reverse this state?","a)Inj. dobutamine
b)steroids
c)Thyroxine
d)Activated protien C","The given history of a pregnant having postpartum hemorrhage developing headache, visual
changes, and hypotension after a vaginal delivery suggests sheehan syndrome. steroids are the drug that can reverse this state.
volume depletion and low cardiac output leading to critically low BP are common in acute   pituitary deficiency and recovery of normal cardiovascular status is rapidly achieved under  hormone and volume replacement therapy without the need for inotropes like dobutamine.
Pituitary apoplexy is a hemorrhagic infarction of large pituitary adenomas or pituitary
infarction due to traumatic major blood loss. If this blood loss occurs during delivery, it's
called sheehan's syndrome. The hyperplastic enlargement of the pituitary (size of gland increases by about 125%), which occurs normally during pregnancy, increases the risk of hemorrhage and   infarction.
Pituitary apoplexy presents acutely as an endocrine emergency, with sudden onset of headache, nausea, visual deficits, persistent hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoglycemia leading to shock. The most prominent symptoms are lactation failure (due to a deficiency of
prolactin) and postpartum amenorrhea (due to a deficiency of gonadotropins).
Because deficiencies of some or all pituitary-responsive hormones may develop after the initial
insult, sheehan syndrome can be heterogeneous and not be identified for years. It can present late with the following features like loss of pubic and axillary hair, hypothyroidism due to decreased
TsH secretion, adrenal insufficiency due to low ACTH.
Treatment is by hormone replacement - first glucocorticoids, later - thyroid hormone, sex steroids, vasopressin, and growth hormones are given. If there is evidence of progressive visual loss, cranial nerve involvement, or loss of consciousness, immediate surgical decompression must be carried
out.",,B,
Q2,All are true about biophysical profile (BPP) except:,"a)Includes breathing, movements, tone, and AFI
b)Can tell us about fetal outcome and fetal pH
c)score is inconsistent with fetal pH at different gestational ages
d)score &lt;4: fetal pH &lt;7.2; score o : 1oo% fetal acidemia","All are true about BPP (biophysical profile) except option C. BPP score is not inconsistent with fetal pH, but has a direct linear relationship with fetal pH and thus can be used to predict fetal acidemia.
BPP is a multi-parametric test to assess uteroplacental insufficiency. It consists of five
components/ variables and the observations are made in a 3o-minute time period.
Components of BPP:
(Mnemonic: BATMaN)
B - Breathing movements of the fetus A - Amniotic fluid volume
T - Tone of the fetus
M - Movements of the fetus



N - Non-stress test (NST)
Each parameter has a maximum score of 2 and a minimum score of o. So the total maximum score will be 1o. A score of 4 or less indicates fetal acidemia.
Interpretation and management of BPP scores:
BPP is directly related to fetal pH and fetal outcome. A lower BPP score is associated with a poor outcome (stillbirth, perinatal mortality) and lower APGAR scores at birth.
A score of &lt;1o is associated with a pH of &lt;7.2 and a score of o is associated with 1oo% fetal acidemia.
Note: The modified biophysical score has only 2 components i.e. NST and amniotic fluid
index only. It is considered abnormal (nonreassuring) when the NST is non-reactive and/or the AFI is &lt;5.

Parameters	Minimal Normal criteria
Fetal breathing movements	≥ 1 episode lasting > 3o seco nds
Amniotic fluid volume (AF V)	≥ 1 pocket measuring 2 cm in two perpendicular planes (2  ×2 cm pocket)
Fetal muscle tone	≥ 1 episode of active limb or t runk extension with the retur n of flexion; Eg. opening and  closing of the hand, consider  ed normal
Gross body movements	≥ 3 discrete body/limb move ments
Non-stress Test (NST)	Reactive pattern

BPP score	Interpretation	Management
1o	Normal, nonasphyxiated fetu s	Repeat test weekly (or biweek ly in diabetic mother or post-  term pregnancy)
8with normal AFV	Normal, nonasphyxiated fetu s	Repeat test weekly (or biweek ly in diabetic mother or post-  term pregnancy)
8 with decreased A FV	Suspicion of chronic fetal asp hyxia	Delivery
6	Possible fetal asphyxia	Deliver, if AFV is abnormal o r >36weeks or if the repeat te st score is ≤ 6. If the repeat s  core >6, observation and rep  eat test weekly
4	Probablefetal asphyxia	Repeat testing same dayIf the repeat score ≤6, delivery

Q3,which of the following is not true about lupus nephritis in pregnancy?,"a)Immunosuppression can be continued during pregnancy
b)Pregnancy to be planned once the disease has been quiescent for at least 6 months and there is no evidence of renal dysfunction
c)High dose corticosteroids for lupus flare in pregnancy is safe
d)Ecospirin, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids, azathioprine are safe in pregnancy","option D is not true about lupus nephritis in pregnancy. Methotrexate and cyclophosphamide are teratogenic and hence they are not safe during pregnancy.
Systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder involving the multisystem. It affects young women of childbearing age. The renal involvement of the disease can manifest in  the form of active lupus nephritis or flare-ups during pregnancy.
clinical features include fever, weight loss, migratory joint pain, and myalgias. It can lead to
preterm births, preeclampsia, and pregnancy loss while the infant can suffer from neonatal lupus and heart block.
Antinuclear antibodies are useful for screening the disease. Double-stranded DNA (ds DNA) is highly specific in diagnosing. other antibodies such as lupus anticoagulant, antiphospholipid   antibodies, anti-Ro, and anti-La antibodies are useful in diagnosis.
Management is as follows
• preconceptional planning plays an important role. conception during a period of quiescence for  at least 6 months determines a successful outcome. Stable remission of renal disease for at least 6 months before conception is recommended.
• corticosteroids are useful during episodes of lupus flare and can be used safely in pregnancy.  For patients on chronic corticosteroid therapy, intravenous hydrocortisone 1oo mg, three doses are given 8 hourly during labor or at the time of cesarean delivery.
• Immunosuppressants such as azathioprine can be continued during pregnancy. It may be used in case of severe SLE
• Hydroxychloroquine is found to be the best for maintenance and is safe in pregnancy. It can prevent the need for prolonged corticosteroid therapy.",,D,6092-3810.PNG
Q4,which of the following is false regarding management of diabetes in pregnancy?,"a)Elective C-section has no role in reducing incidence of brachial plexus injury
b)In a patient being planned for induction of labor, night dose of intermediate insulin is given as planned, and the morning dose is withheld
c)In active labor, if RBs &lt;7o mg%, D5 is started at 1oo-15o ml/hr till the RBs is &gt;1oo mg%
d)Capillary blood glucose monitoring levels are kept at fasting- 95 mg%; 1 hr postprandial- 14o mg%; 2 hrs postprandial- 12o mg%","False statement regarding management of diabetes in pregnancy is option A. Cesarean section is found to be protective against traumatic injuries such as brachial plexus injury, in macrosomic
babies born to mothers with diabetes. An elective C-section is found to be more protective than an emergency C-section.
Almost 5o % of pregnant women with diabetes are delivered by c-section. Indications for c-section in diabetic pregnant women are-
• Fetal macrosomia of ≥4.5kgs to avoid trauma to mother or neonate, and also to avoid brachial plexus injury in the baby
• unsatisfactory progression of labor
• Complicated diabetes mellitus
• Fetal compromise during delivery
• Elderly primigravida (age &gt;3o years)
• Multigravida with bad obstetric history previously
• pregnancy that is associated with complications like preeclampsia, polyhydramnios or malpresentation
other options:
option B: In a planned delivery, although the bedtime dose of intermediate-acting insulin is given, it is recommended that the morning dose must be withheld. This is due to reduced insulin
requirements after delivery. Therefore, regular insulin is used for glycemic control during this time.
option C: In active labor, if RBs (Random blood glucose) &lt;7o mg%, D5 (5% dextrose) is started at 1oo-15o ml/hr till the RBs is &gt;1oo mg%. Before initiation of labor, normal saline is used for   iv infusion.
option D: self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose is advised in a pregnant woman diagnosed with diabetes. subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring devices can also be used for the
same. The glucose goals recommended are:
• Fasting: ≤95 mg/dL
• 1 hour post-prandial: ≤14o mg/dL
• 2 hrs post-prandial: ≤12o mg/dL",,A,
Q5,which of the following statements regarding Mgso4 is false?,"a)Mgso4 causes uterine relaxation, but is dose dependant
b)Mgso4 is continued upto 24 hours after delivery or last attack of seizure
c)It has inhibitory effect on cerebral cortex thereby preventing seizures and lowering the Bp
d)In renal failure, Mgso4 loading dose can be given, but maintenence dose should be adjusted based on renal function","The false statement regarding Mgso4 (Magnesium sulfate) is option C. It has an inhibitory effect  on the cerebral cortex, thereby preventing seizures, but this action is not responsible for lowering blood pressure.



Mgso4 is mainly used in preeclampsia due to its specific anticonvulsant action and
neuroprotective action on the cortex. Mgso4 acts as a membrane stabilizer. It reduces motor endplate sensitivity to acetylcholine and blocks neuronal calcium influx. It is not used to
treat hypertension, although it shows some hypotensive action by decreasing vascular response to vasopressors.
Mgso4 is used for the management of eclampsia and as prophylaxis in severe pre-eclampsia. The therapeutic level of magnesium in eclampsia is 4-7mEq/L. The two regimens commonly used are   pritchard and sibai regimen.
other actions:
• cerebral vasodilatation
• uterine artery vasodilatation
• uterine tocolytic i.e. inhibits uterine contractility
• Increased production of endothelial prostacyclin
• Inhibits platelet activation other options:
option A: Mgso4 inhibits uterine contractility but is dose-dependent (only above serum values of 8-1o mEq/L).
option B: Mgso4 has to be administered up to 24 hours after the last seizure (in postpartum      seizure) or delivery, whichever is later. For recurrent seizures, 2 g IV bolus is given in the above regimen.
option D: Magnesium is cleared almost exclusively by renal excretion. But, in renal failure, the
initial 4-g loading dose of magnesium sulfate can be safely administered regardless of renal
function. only the maintenance dose needs to be altered according to the renal function. This is
because the loading dose is responsible for reaching therapeutic levels, but the maintenance doses are responsible for maintaining steady states.

Regimen	Loading Dose	Maintenance Dose
Intramuscular (pritchard)	4g (2o% solution) IV over 3-5 minutefollowed by 1og (5o     %), deep IM(5 gm in each bu  ttock)	5g (5o%) IM 4 hourly in alte rnate buttocks
Intravenous (zuspan or sibai)	4g IV slow over 15-2o minute	1-2g/h IV infusion",,C,
Q6,"A couple already has 3 children and has been trying for another one for the last 1 year.    However, the husband is diagnosed with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. which of the following is/are true:","a)1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
b)1, 2 and 5
c)2, 3, 4 and 5
d)1, 3 and 5","The given patient is diagnosed with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. True statements about the condition are 1, 3, and 5.
Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in a male is the presence of impaired testicular function (hypogonadism), secondary to a hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (hypogonadotropic).
causes include:



• congenital
• Anosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (kallmann syndrome)
• Normosmic isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)
• Acquired
• Drugs and alcohol
• Infiltrative or infectious pituitary lesions, brain radiation, trauma to the brain
• Hyperprolactinemia
• Systemic diseases such as hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis
A male with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism will have the following findings:
• Hormone levels
• Low LH (Luteinizing hormone), low FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone). This can be confirmed on GnRH stimulation test showing persistently reduced LH, and FSH levels.
• Low testosterone.
• High prolactin levels and high prolactin: testosterone ratio.
• Low testicular volume - oligospermia: the presence of less than 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen. Sperm motility is not impaired.
• MRI showing anomalous or absent olfactory bulb in kallmann syndrome.
Treatment:
• Testosterone supplementation: Helps reverse the symptoms and signs of hypogonadism. It is advised only in males not planning to have children.
• Pulsatile GnRH or gonadotropin (FSH and hcG)  therapies: In males planning to have children.
• Assisted reproductive techniques: Intrauterine insemination (IUI), Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IcSI)",,D,
Q7,All of the following are theories of causation of preeclampsia except:,"a)prostaglandins play an important role. Thromboxane A2 decreases; prostacyclin:Thromboxane ratio increases in preeclampsia
b)Endotheilal cell dysfunction leads to reduced nitric oxide levels and this causes the clinical presentation of preeclampsia
c)Vasoconstriction leads to ischemia, necrosis and hemorrhage and end organ damage seen in preeclampsia
d)Anti-angiogenic factors play an important role in preeclampsia. There is an increase in sFlt-1 and decrease in PIGF.","All of the following are theories of causation of preeclampsia except option A. There is reduced or absent prostacyclin(PGI2) production with increased production of thromboxane (TXA2) and
reduced ratio of prostacyclin: thromboxane in preeclampsia.
The development of pre-eclampsia may be explained by:
• Failure of 2nd wave of trophoblastic invasion into uterine vessels, leading to decreased placental perfusion.
• Maternal inflammatory response directed against foreign fetal antigens, leading to immunological maladaptation.
• Maternal maladaptation to cardiovascular and inflammatory changes of normal pregnancy.



• Genetic factors and epigenetic influences.
The basic pathology is endothelial dysfunction and vascular spasm that affects vessels supplying all organs including the brain, kidney, uterus, etc. This ischemia leads to necrosis, hemorrhage,  and end-organ damage of these organs.
changes leading to vasospasm and endothelial dysfunction include:
• Imbalance of prostaglandins (Reduced vasodilatory PGI2, increased vasoconstrictor TXA2).
• Reduced angiotensinase activity and increased sensitivity of vessels to angiotensin II, which is a vasopressor.
• Reduced production of nitric oxide due to endothelial dysfunction. It normally acts as a vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation and thrombus formation.
• Increased production of endothelin 1 by endothelial cells. It is a potent vasoconstrictor.
• Increased inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukins (IL-6) leading to endothelial injury.
• Increased lipid peroxides, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide anion radicals, leading to endothelial damage.
• Increased production of anti-angiogenic factors as compared to angiogenic factors. Two main
antiangiogenic factors overproduced by the trophoblasts of women with preeclampsia are soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase I (SFlt-1) and soluble endoglin. Increased sFlt-1 inactivates and reduces    the levels of free placental growth factor (PlGF) and VEGF concentrations.
All these processes lead to endothelial dysfunction and causes the clinical presentation of preeclampsia.",,A,
Q8,The following cost-effective investigations are routinely recommended in the screening of antenatal mothers except?,"a)Echocardiography for cardiac disease
b)urine analysis for bacteriuria
c)Blood sugar levels for GDM
d)VDRL for syphilis","Except for echocardiography for cardiac disease, all other tests (urine analysis for bacteriuria, blood sugar levels for GDM, VDRL for syphilis) are cost-effective investigations routinely
recommended in the screening of antenatal mothers.
Echocardiography is an expensive investigation and is not routinely recommended to look for cardiac abnormalities in all pregnant ladies. Indications for fetal echocardiography include:
• Abnormality in routine genetic screening such as USG to look for nuchal translucency (NT). NT is the space between the fetal skin and the underlying soft tissue near the neck of the fetus filled  with fluid. NT of &gt;3mm is abnormal and warrants the need for detailed USG and fetal
echocardiography
• Gestational diabetes mellitus for early detection of fetal anomalies. Done at 2o-22 weeks.
• Heart disease in pregnancy like congenital heart disease or Marfan's syndrome needs routine echocardiography (color doppler) at mid-pregnancy to look for structural abnormalities, valve  anatomy, etc.
Routine investigations during pregnancy:
• 1st trimester:



• Hemoglobin, hematocrit, blood grouping, blood glucose, and VDRL.
• Midstream urine to look for protein, sugar, pus cells, and evidence of urinary tract infections or bacteriuria by dipstick test (for nitrites).
• serology for rubella, hepatitis B virus, and HIV.
• Genetic screening like maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein.
• ultrasound scan to look for gross fetal abnormalities, number of fetuses, and dating of pregnancy.
• 2nd trimester:
• ultrasound scan (booking scan at 18-2o weeks) is done to look for cardiac activity, structural abnormalities, amniotic fluid index and placental location.
• Triple test at 11-13 weeks for a high risk mother.
• oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) at 24-26 weeks with a 1-hour 5o-gram glucose load or a diagnostic 2-hour 75-gram glucose load. This is to look for gestational diabetes mellitus.
• 3rd trimester:
• Repeat hemoglobin, hematocrit, and serology for syphilis and HIV.
• Vaginal examination to look for streptococcus agalactiae.",,A,
Q9,which of the following cerclage procedures would be done in a nonpregnant female through a transabdominal approach?,"a)Lash and Lash cerclage
b)Benson and Durfee cerclage
c)wurms cerclage
d)Laparoscopic cerclage","The cerclage procedure performed on nonpregnant females through a transabdominal approach is laparoscopic cerclage. Abdominal cerclage is conducted through either laparotomy or laparoscopy  and is recommended in cases where the cervix is hypoplastic or in instances of prior failed vaginal cerclage.
cerclage is usually done for cervical incompetence, defined as the inability to maintain pregnancy till term due to a functional or structural defect of the cervix. cervical incompetence is diagnosed  by clinical examination and ultrasonography showing the presence of short cervix (&lt;25 mm)
with or without funneling of internal os.
prophylactic cerclage is done around 14 weeks of pregnancy or 2 weeks earlier than the previous fetal loss. Rescue or emergency cerclage is done anytime within 24 weeks of gestation. It
should only be done when there is bulging of membranes through the dilated cervix.
commonly used types of cervical cerclage during pregnancy:
• McDonald's procedure - non-absorbable (mersilene) material placed as a purse-string suture at the level of the internal os
• Modified shirodkar's procedure - non-absorbable
(mersilene) tape passed subcutaneously through a transverse anterior incision and tied posteriorly Removal of cerclage should be done by 37 weeks of gestation. It can be removed earlier in case of  preterm labor or if signs of abortion are seen.
other options:



option A: Lash and Lash cerclage is the first described treatment for cervical incompetence,   involving the placement of stitches in the cervix through the transvaginal approach. It is now replaced by procedures such as McDonald's and shirodkar's.
option B: Benson und Durfee cerclage is the technique of placement of cervical cerclage through a transabdominal approach by a laparotomy. It is preferred in pregnant females when the vaginal
approach is either not possible or very difficult.
option C: Wurms cerclage is a type of cerclage used in pregnancy where monofilament material   (prolene) is used to place two higher circumferential sutures through the cervix without the need for bladder dissection.",,D,
Q10,urinary tract infection in a pregnant lady in her 2nd trimester is best defined as:,"a)Growth of 1o^3 coliform in suprapubic sample
b)Growth of 1o^5 coliform in voided urine sample
c)Frequency with dysuria with &gt;3 wBC/HPF
d)Frequency with dysuria with positive nitrite and leucoesterase dipstick test","Urinary tract infection (UTI) in a pregnant lady in her 2nd trimester is best defined as the growth of 1o5 coliforms in a voided urine sample. Urine culture is the standard method to evaluate UTI    pregnancy.
UTI in pregnancy is a bacterial infection caused by organisms in the normal perineal flora. It can vary from asymptomatic bacteriuria to symptomatic cystitis or pyelonephritis.
Asymptomatic bacteriuria is characterized by persistent and actively multiplying bacteria in the
urinary tract without any symptoms. A positive culture is demonstrated during the antenatal visit. It can complicate into a symptomatic infection when untreated.
symptomatic infections include
• Cystitis is characterized by dysuria, urgency and frequency along with pyuria and bacteriuria. Microscopic hematuria is also seen
• pyelonephritis is common in the second trimester, nulliparous and young women. It is usually    unilateral with fever, chills, and ache in the lumbar region. Nausea, vomiting, and costovertebral  tenderness may be seen. The organisms causing pyelonephritis are E. coli &gt;&gt; streptococcus, s.aureus &gt; Enterobacter, klebsiella
UTI is evaluated by blood studies including complete blood count, serum creatinine, blood urea   nitrogen, urine studies and imaging. Urine studies mainly include a urine culture, urine analysis, and dipstick.
Urine culture is the standard method of evaluating UTIs in pregnancy. positive urine culture     shows a bacterial growth of &gt;1oo,ooo colony-forming units (CFUs) per milliliter in a voided urine sample. The presence of white blood cell (WBC) casts is suggestive of pyelonephritis. No  other screening methods are as reliable as a urine culture.
Urine analysis showing positive nitrites, leukocyte esterase, WBCs (pyuria), red blood cells  (RBCs), and protein are suggestive of UTI. pyuria is seen in cystitis. Dipstick for nitrite and leukocyte esterase is used to evaluate asymptomatic bacteriuria.
Management of UTIs is as follows
• Asymptomatic bacteriuria is mainly treated with oral antibiotics such as amoxicillin, ampicillin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.



• pyelonephritis is managed with intravenous hydration, and antibiotics such as
ampicillin+gentamycin, cefazolin or ceftriaxone.",,B,
Q11,which of the following is incorrect regarding innervation of the uterus?,"a)sensory level is from T1o to L1
b)uterine contractility is mediated by innervations from level T7 - T8
c)In the 1st stage of labor, pain is due to the fibres at level of T1o - L1
d)In early labor, pain is usually because of the uterine contraction","The incorrect regarding innervation of the uterus is statement B. uterine contractility is mainly   mediated by hormonal mechanisms. Estrogen, prostaglandin, and oxytocin produce contraction, while progesterone causes relaxation.
uterine sensory supply is by ascending afferent fibers which pass through the inferior hypogastric plexus and enter the spinal cord through T1o-T12 and L1 roots.
Labor pain is due to stimulation of nociceptors in the genital tract caused by ischemia.
• First stage labor: pain is mediated by T1o to L1 spinal segments. It is caused by distension of the cervix and low uterine segments along with isometric uterine contraction.
• second stage labor: pain is carried by T12 to L1 and s2 to s4 spinal segments. It is caused by tissue damage in the pelvis and perineum
Analgesia in labor is achieved by intramuscular injection of pethidine 5o mg. Metoclopramide is added to prevent vomiting. pethidine is avoided within 2 hours of delivery as it is a known
respiratory depressant to the fetus. when relief of pain is required throughout labor, regional analgesia is preferred through pudendal nerve block, epidural analgesia, spinal anesthesia or  combined epidural-spinal anesthesia.",,B,
Q12,seminal vesicles and vas deferens would be bilaterally absent congenitally in which of the following conditions?,"a)Cystic fibrosis
b)klinefelter syndrome
c)kallmann syndrome
d)kartagener syndrome","seminal vesicles and vas deferens would be bilaterally absent, congenitally in cystic fibrosis. This is known as the congenital bilateral absence of vas deference (CBAVD).
Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects fluid secretion in the exocrine glands and in the epithelial lining. It is caused primarily due to a mutation in the CFTR gene, which
codes for an anion channel in the apical membranes of epithelial cells. This leads to abnormally viscous secretions that obstruct organ passages, resulting in recurrent infections, pancreatic
insufficiency, steatorrhea, malnutrition, hepatic cirrhosis, intestinal obstruction, and male infertility.
Infertility is due to azoospermia and CBAVD. In some patients, the bilateral absence of the vas deferens may be the only feature suggesting an underlying CFTR mutation.
on examination, a normal reproductive tract (including testis, and epididymis) is seen, with
bilateral absence of vas deferens and atrophic or absent seminal vesicles. semen analysis shows a low-volume (o.5 mL), acidic ejaculate that is devoid of fructose and seminal vesicle fluid. There     may be associated renal agenesis in some patients.
other options:
option B: klinefelter syndrome is a genetic disorder that results from a 47, XXy karyotype
in phenotypically male patients. They present with gynecomastia, azoospermia, and infertility due



to hyalinization of the seminiferous tubules and a small testis.
option C: kallmann syndrome is associated with a low or absent GnRH that is characterized by anosmia, hypogonadism, infertility, cryptorchidism, delayed pubertal maturation, and
neurological abnormalities.
option D: kartagener syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting ciliary motility; it  is characterized by situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. Male infertility may be present and is due to asthenospermia (immotile spermatozoa due to impaired sperm flagella     function).",,A,
Q13,which of the following graphs represents normal response to OGTT?,"a)Graph A
b)Graph B
c)Graph C
d)Graph D","The graph representing normal response to oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) is graph D.
oral glucose tolerance test is routinely used to diagnose gestational diabetes mellitus. It is   performed by giving a bolus of glucose (75g) to the patient, and measuring blood glucose at intervals of time to assess the tolerance and response of the islets of pancreas to glucose. 5  measurements of glucose is noted in blood and urine at half hour intervals.
Indications:
• patients with symptoms suggestive of diabetes mellitus, but with fasting blood glucose value being borderline (between 1oo-126 mg/dl).
• Excessive weight gain during pregnancy, a past history of big baby (more than 4 kg) or a past history of miscarriage.
• To rule out benign renal glucosuria.
Glucose Tolerance Curve (GTC) is the graph plotted by taking plasma glucose measurements on Y-axis and plotting against time, on the X-axis.


Graph D: Normal: This is the normal response seen in a healthy individual. It is characterized by a peak glucose value reached within 1 hour, following which glucose levels reach the base value. The



levels don't cross the renal threshold at any point of time.
Graph A and Graph B: Diabetes mellitus: The graph will peak after 1-1.5 hours and does not return to fasting level within 2.5 hours. The highest value exceeds the renal threshold.
Depending on severity, the graph can show mild, moderate, and severe diabetic curve.
Graph C: Lag curve: The fasting blood glucose is normal here, but the curve rapidly rises in 1/2 to 1 hour and exceeds the renal threshold. There is a rapid and complete return to normal value in a few minutes. This is seen in hyperthyroidism, early diabetes, and sometimes during pregnancy.",6076-3806.PNG,D,6100-3811.PNG
Q14,kassowitz rule is related to:,"a)Primary syphillis
b)congenital syphillis
c)Secondary syphillis
d)Latent syphillis","kassowitz rule is related to congenital syphilis.
According to kassowitz rule, if a woman with untreated syphilis has a series of pregnancies, the likelihood of infection of the fetus in later pregnancies becomes less. Usually, only the first
pregnancy is an abortion, the following pregnancy losses will be stillbirths, and later pregnancies will have alive babies with features of congenital syphilis.
Maternal syphilis can cause fetal infection (congenital syphilis) by several routes, the most
common being transplacental transmission, followed by transmission during delivery or across   the placental membranes. Early maternal syphilis has a higher transmission as compared to late syphilis.
Up to 7o percent of women with maternal syphilis have an adverse outcome. Most common complications include preterm labour, stillbirth, fetal-growth restriction and fetal death.
Newborns can have features of infection such as jaundice, ascites, petechiae, purpura, pneumonia, myocarditis and long bone involvement.
Maternal syphilis in all trimesters should be treated with parenteral penicillin G in order to prevent the spread of infection to fetus. The treatment of choice for congenital syphilis is
penicillin.",,B,
Q15,Modified biophysical profile includes:,"a)NST and fetal tone
b)NST and AFI
c)NST and breathing movements
d)NST and gross fetal movements","The modified biophysical profile includes NST (nonstress test) and AFI (amniotic fluid index).
It is a modification of the biophysical profile (BPP) test, including only 2 parameters so that it can be performed more routinely (twice a week) for surveillance and takes less time (1o minutes).
Modified BPP is considered nonreassuring when the NST is non-reactive and/ or the AFI is &lt; 5. The nonstress test is a screening test for fetal wellness. It describes fetal heart rate acceleration
(measured by a Doppler) in response to fetal movements (perceived by mother). An
acoustic stimulation nonstress test is a type of NST in which a loud external sound is used to startle the fetus and provoke heart rate accelerations.
• Reactive (Reassuring) NST - Two or more accelerations of 15 seconds duration, 15 beats per minute amplitude, in a 2o-minute testing time.
• Non-reactive (Non-reassuring) NST - Absence of any fetal reactivity.



BPP is a multi-parametric, screening test to assess uteroplacental insufficiency. It consists of five components/ variables and the observations are made in a 3o-minute time period.
components of BPP:
(Mnemonic: BATMaN)
B - Breathing movements of the fetus A - Amniotic fluid volume
T - Tone of the fetus
M - Movements of the fetus N - Non-stress test (NST)
Each parameter has a maximum score of 2 and a minimum score of o. So the total maximum score will be 1o. A score of 4 or less indicates fetal acidemia.
Interpretation and management of BPP scores:
BPP is directly related to fetal pH and fetal outcome. A lower BPP score is associated with a poor outcome (stillbirth, perinatal mortality) and lower APGAR scores at birth.
A score of &lt;1o is associated with a pH of &lt;7.2 and a score of o is associated with 1oo% fetal acidemia.
Note: The modified biophysical score has only 2 components i.e. NST and amniotic fluid
index only. It is considered abnormal (nonreassuring) when the NST is non-reactive and/or the AFI is &lt;5.

Q16,"All of the following statements about anti-Mullerian hormones are true, except:","a)Lipopeptide secreted from granulosa cell of early antral follicle
b)correlates with pregnancy rate of IVF cycle
c)It decreases sensitivity of the pre-antral follicles to FSH","All of the following statements about anti-Mullerian hormones (AMH) are true, except option B. AMH is a glycopeptide secreted by the granulosa cells of the pre-antral follicles and small antral follicles of the ovary.
In males, AMH inhibits the development of the Mullerian system and its absence can result in
hermaphroditism. In the female, it helps in follicular development and oocyte maturation. In the absence of AMH, growing follicles are more responsive to FSH. This is because AMH reduces the sensitivity of pre-antral follicles to FSH (option D) thereby regulating the follicular growth.
Serum AMH predicts ovarian reserve in a woman with infertility or secondary amenorrhea. Also,   AMH values decrease with age and can indicate menopause, owing to the reduced ovarian reserve. This makes AMH the best predictor for measuring ovarian reserve. However, recent studies have   shown intercycle variations ofAMH levels, hence it is recommended to measure AMH along with  antral follicle count (on USG) on days 1-3 of the cycle (option A).
It is also a useful predictor of pregnancy rate in infertile women undergoing IVF (In-vitro  fertilization) treatment (option C). It helps in assessing the ovarian response to exogenous gonadotropin stimulation, blastocyst formation, and miscarriage rates.
Values and interpretation:
• Normal value: 2–6.8 ng/mL
• Poor ovarian reserve: &lt;1 ng/mL
• PCOD and hyperstimulation syndrome: &gt;1o ng/mL",,B,
Q17,which of the following statements is false regarding post-partum hemorrhage?,"a)Start colloids initially, 4 times the blood lost
b)Primary PPH occurs within 24 hours of childbirth
c)PPH is loss of 5oo ml of blood in vaginal delivery
d)causes include retained placenta and atony","The false statement regarding PPH is option A. WHO recommends intravenous isotonic
crystalloids over intravenous colloids for fluid replacement in PPH. This is because colloids are



not found to be useful, and some colloids (hydroxyethyl starch) can even be harmful.
Postpartum hemorrhage is defined as a loss of more than 5oo ml of blood after completion of the third stage of labor (in vaginal delivery).
PPH is blood loss of more than 1ooo mL from the genital tract following cesarean section.
Depending upon the amount of blood loss, PPH can be, minor (&lt;1L) or major (&gt;1L). Major is further subdivided into moderate (1L-2L) and severe (&gt;2L).
Types of PPH:
Primary/early PPH: Hemorrhage occurring within 24 hours of childbirth. causes include
• Atony: Primi, grand multipara, over distended uterus, hydramnios, precipitate labor, prolonged labor, uterine malformations, fibroid uterus
• Trauma: Instrumental deliveries, episiotomy, precipitate labor, macrosomia
• Retained tissues: retained placenta, blood clots
• Bleeding disorders: sepsis, Intrauterine death, HELLP syndrome.
secondary/ late PPH: Hemorrhage occurring after 24 hours and up to 12 weeks postpartum.
causes include
• Placental polyp: Retained products undergo necrosis with fibrin deposition and eventually form a placental polyp, which on detachment from the myometrium causes brisk hemorrhage.
• Abnormal involution of the placental site.
• Retention of placental cotyledon or products of conception.
• uterine artery pseudoaneurysm.
• Endometritis
• coagulopathy
Resuscitative measures include
• Airway, breathing, circulation assessment
• A high concentration of oxygen (1o–15 l/min) via a facemask
• Blood transfusion if clinically required
• Fluid resuscitation with warmed fluids up to 3.5 liters, starting with up to 2 liters of crystalloids such as normal saline and ringer's lactate. colloids can be used when there is a need for packed    RBcs transfusion, until blood is arranged.",,A,
Q18,Recommended HPV vaccination schedule for 9 to 14 year olds according to WHO SAGE guidelines is:,"a)1 or 2 doses
b)2 doses
c)1 dose
d)3 doses","The recommended HPV vaccination schedule for 9 to 14-year-olds according to WHO sAGE guidelines is 1 or 2 doses.
The recommendations for different age groups are as follows:
• 1 or 2 dose schedule for girls aged 9-14 years.



• 1 or 2 dose schedule for young women aged 15-2o years.
• 2 doses with a 6-month interval for women older than 21 years.
• 3 doses (or atleast 2 doses) for immunocompromised individuals.
As per WHO SAGE (Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization), a single-dose HPV
vaccination schedule can provide comparable efficacy and durability of protection to a two-dose
regimen. This can help in wider coverage of vaccination of all girls in low-middle income
countries. Therefore, a 1 or 2-dose schedule is recommended for females aged between 9-2o years.
The available vaccinations for HPV are:
• Gardasil 9 (HPV 9) is a nonavalent vaccine active against HPV 6,11,16,18,31,33,45,52,58.
• Gardasil 4 (HPV 4) is a quadrivalent vaccine against 6,11,16,18. This is now replaced by HPV 9.
• Cervarix (HPV 2) is a bivalent vaccine active against 16, 18.",,A,
Q19,All of the following coagulation factors increase in pregnancy except:,"a)Factor II
b)Factor VII
c)Factor VIII
d)Factor XI","All the above coagulation factors (Factors ll, Vll, Vlll) are increased in pregnancy except factor xl. Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state. This controls bleeding and helps in hemostasis after
placental separation.
Hematological changes in pregnancy:
• All clotting factors are increased, except factors 11 and 13. The levels return to normal within 2 weeks of delivery.
• Anticoagulants protein C, protein S, and antithrombin are decreased during pregnancy.
• Fibrinogen levels are increased by 5o%.
• Clotting time and bleeding time remain unaffected.
• The viscosity of blood decreases due to relative hemodilution (relatively higher increase in plasma volume as compared to the increase in RBC mass).
• ESR is raised due to an increase in fibrinogen and globulin levels.
• Because of a marked fall in albumin level and only a slight rise of globulin, the
normal albumin:globulin ratio of 1.7:1 is decreased to 1:1.
• Platelet counts remain the same or fall by a small amount (15%).
The most common cause of decreased platelet count in pregnancy is benign gestational
thrombocytopenia. This is due to hemodilution and increased platelet consumption and the women are generally asymptomatic.",,D,
Q20,"A pregnant lady at 2o weeks of gestation comes with complaints of acute onset fever, and
pain in the right lumbar region. It is associated with chills, nausea, and vomiting. urinalysis reveals the presence of E.coli and a diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is made. Which of the   following is incorrect regarding the management of acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy?","a)Hospitalise, send urine and blood cultures and start on antibiotics.
b)Oral antibiotics once afebrile
c)Maintain urine output &gt;5o ml/hr; Intravenous crystalloids can be given
d)Discharge if afebrile for 72 hrs; continue antibiotics for 5 days","The incorrect statement regarding the management of acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy is option
D. The patient can be discharged once afebrile for 24 hours, and antibiotics have to be continued



for 7 to 1o days.
Acute pyelonephritis is one of the frequent and serious medical complications occurring in 2nd-trimester of pregnancy. The most common causative organism is E.coli.
clinical features include sudden onset fever, chills, and aching pain in the lumbar region (usually unilateral). It is associated with nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Tenderness in the costovertebral angle can be elicited on examination.
Diagnosis is confirmed by the collection of urine (preferably from catheterization) and analysis to look for leukocytes and bacteria.
Management protocol for pyelonephritis during pregnancy is
• Hospitalization is recommended for all patients. very rare cases of uncomplicated pyelonephritis can be managed on an outpatient basis
• urine and blood (if temperature is &gt; 39 degrees c) samples are collected for culture.
• Aggressive intravenous hydration to maintain adequate urine output is the mainstay of treatment. A urinary output ≥5o mL/hr is maintained with intravenous crystalloids.
• vital signs such as blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and oxygen saturation along with urine output should be monitored for signs of worsening sepsis.
• Empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy is started with ampicillin plus gentamicin, cefazolin or ceftriaxone. It is switched to oral antibiotics once the patient is afebrile.
• In case of persistent infection or lack of clinical improvement by 48 to 72 hours, renal
sonography is recommended to look for urinary tract abnormalities (like obstruction or calculi).
• The patient is discharged when afebrile for 24 hours and antimicrobial therapy is continued for 7 to 1o days.
• urine culture is repeated 1–2 weeks after antimicrobial therapy is completed.",,D,
Q21,All of the following are the diagnostic criteria for preterm labor except?,"a)4 contractions in 2o min and 8 contractions in 6o min with changes in cervix
b)cervical dilatation &gt; 2 cm
c)More than 8o percent effaced cervix
d)cervix posterior in position","All of the following options are the diagnostic criteria for preterm labor except an posterior
position of cervix (option D). An anterior cervix favors a higher bishop's score, which means a   higher chance of preterm labor as compared to the posterior cervix. The midline position of the cervix has also shown higher incidence of preterm labor as compared to posterior cervix.
preterm labor (pTL) is defined as labor occuring between 2oweeks to 37th completed week of gestation.
Diagnostic criteria of preterm labour include:
• Regular uterine contractions at least one in every 1o minutes, or 4 contractions in 2o minutes or 8 contractions in 6o min with/without pain.
• cervix dilatation ≥2 cm
• cervix effacement ≥8o%
• Length of cervix (on TvS) ≤2.5 cm and funneling of the internal os &gt;1 cm

Q22,which statement is false regarding late decelerations?,"a)starts after peak of uterine contraction and ends after uterine contraction ends
b)They are smooth and gradual
c)At least 1o beats, 2 times in a 2o min period above baseline
d)Not associated with accelerations","The false statement about late decelerations among the given options, is option C- at least 1o beats, 2 times in a 2o min period above baseline.
Typically, a late deceleration causes a fall in the fetal heart rate (FHR) by a depth of &lt;1o to 2o bpm below the baseline. It is usually not accompanied by accelerations (option D).
Late decelerations are smooth, gradual, (option B) symmetrical decline in the FHR that begins at or after the peak of uterine contraction and ends only after the contraction has ended (option A).
It is usually indicative of uteroplacental insufficiency and fetal hypoxia. other causes of late
decelerations include hypotension from epidural anesthesia, excessive use of oxytocin, maternal hypertension, diabetes, and placental abruption.
A late deceleration plus decreased variability in FHR is predictive of fetal acidemia and neonatal morbidity.
The given CTG shows late decelerations and it's relation with the uterine contraction.





The below CTG shows early decelerations. In early decelerations, the onset, it's nadir and the recovery of deceleration coincide with the beginning, peak, and ending of uterine contraction respectively.
Early decelerations are seen in fetal head compression. They typically cause a fall of ≤ 2o to 3o bpm below the baseline. These early decelerations are common during active labour and are
benign in nature.


A variable deceleraton is a drop in the FHR that begins with the uterine contactions onset and  reaches a nadir in &lt;3o seconds.Its depth is ≥15 bpm in and the deceleration lasts between 15 seconds to 2 minutes.
The slope of FHR change is erratic, giving the wave form its jagged shape. A variable deceleration is indicative of umbilical cord occlusion.

Q23,what is the age group distribution for vulval cancer?,"a)Not age specific
b)35-55 years
c)55-85 years
d)Both of the above","The age group distribution for vulval cancer is 55 to 85 years (option C).
Vulval cancer is a malignancy of elderly women, usually in their 6th and 7th decades of life. It can also be seen in younger women who have been diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections
such as HIV and HPV infections. The average age of diagnosis is 65 years.
Persistent HPV, HSV infections, smoking, chronic immunosuppression and chronic inflammation such as lichen sclerosis are risk factors. Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is the preinvasive     condition of the vulva.
Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of vulvar cancer. The most common site of vulvar cancer is labia majora &gt; Clitoris &gt; Labia Minora.
Vulval cancer generally presents with vulvar pruritus, vulvar swelling, a lump or an ulcer. Pain is usually a late feature of the disease.
The lump is seen as a pigmented papular raised area and the ulcers often have everted margins and usually bleed and cause an offensive vulval discharge.
The most common type of spread in vulval cancer is the lymphatic route. The first lymph node to be involved is the superficial inguinal lymph node and hence, the sentinel lymph node biopsy is     helpful for evaluating the spread of vulval cancer and helps attain an adequate surgical procedure with a good prognosis.
Treatment of vulval cancer generally involves simple or radical, partial or total vulvectomy for the management of the primary tumour and inguinofemoral lymph node dissection for the
involvement of the lymph nodes. This is decided based on the staging of the disease.",,C,
Q24,"The following are correct regarding normal placenta, except ______.","a)placenta weight at term is 47o g
b)Round-oval with 22 cm diameter
c)Extraplacental membranes and 2-vesseled umbilical cord present
d)central thickness &gt;2.5 cm","Among the given options, Extraplacental membranes and 2-vesseled umbilical cord present (option C) is the wrong statement.
At term, the normal placenta weighs 47o g (option A), is round to oval with a 22-cm
diameter (option B) and has a central thickness of ≥2.5 cm (option D). The placenta is composed of a placental disc, extraplacental membranes, and a three-vessel umbilical cord. Hence, option C is the wrong statement.
The normal human placenta is discoid, deciduate, and hemochorial.
The term deciduate means that the placenta is shed at the time of parturition. Hemochorial means that the maternal blood directly comes in contact with the fetal trophoblasts.
The placenta consists of two plates. The chorionic plate lies in the fetal surface. It is lined by the amniotic membrane and the umbilical cord is attached to this plate.
The basal plate is the maternal aspect and lies against the uterine wall. It is divided by clefts into portions termed as cotyledons.",,C,

b)calculated from the last day of the last menstrual period
c)In an IVF pregnancy, day of embryo transfer/day of fertilization is needed to calculate pOG
d)crown-rump length is the best measure of period of gestation in the first trimester","Gestational age or period of gestation (POG) refers to the duration of pregnancy calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP). It is usually expressed in weeks.
According to Naegele's rule, the estimated due date (EDD) is obtained by adding 7 days and  subtracting 3 months from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP). Another method



involves adding 9 months and 7 days to the LMP. Less than 5% of births follow Naegele's rule. It is based on a 28-day regular cycle.
If the cycle is shorter/longer than 28 days, corrected EDD is calculated as follows:
• For a 35-day cycle, add another 7 (35-28=7) days to the calculated EDD to get the corrected EDD.
• For a 25-day cycle, subtract 3 (28-25=3) days from the calculated EDD to get the corrected EDD.
other options:
option A and D: The best method of assessing the gestational age is by measuring the
crown-rump length (CRL) using ultrasonography between 7 to 12 weeks of gestation. It is measured from the vertex to the coccyx. CRL (in mm) + 6.5 = gestational age in weeks.

Gradual elevation of cA125 is considered the first sign of relapse of ovarian cancer. Tamoxifen is   recommended for recurrent ovarian cancer if there is only biochemical evidence of the recurrence of ovarian cancer. otherwise, conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy is administered.
Recurrence of ovarian cancer can be classified as platinum-refractory, platinum-sensitive, and platinum-resistant disease.
• platinum-refractory disease includes women who progress during primary chemotherapy. It has a worse prognosis.
• platinum-resistant disease includes women who relapse within 6 months of primary therapy.
palliative, single, non-platinum chemotherapy is recommended for platinum-refractory and platinum-resistant disease. Bevacizumab has been approved for the treatment of
platinum-resistant disease. It can also be used in combination with weekly paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and topotecan.
• platinum-sensitive disease includes women who relapse more than 6 months after primary
therapy. These patients are treated with a platinum-based combination such as carboplatin and



paclitaxel or gemcitabine.",,C,
Q37,what can be said about this graph?,"a)This is a non-stress test.
b)The baseline shows that the fetus has tachycardia.
c)The beat to beat variability is less/inadequate.
d)This is a uterine contraction graph.","The given graph showing only the tracing for the fetal heart rate (FHR) is a non-stress test (NST). The NST is a screening test for fetal wellness. It describes fetal heart rate acceleration (measured  by a doppler) in response to fetal movements (perceived by the mother).
• Reactive (reassuring) NST - Two or more accelerations of 15 seconds duration and amplitude of 15 beats/min, in a 2o-minute testing time
• Non-reactive (non-reassuring) NST - Absence of any fetal reactivity.
other options:
option B: Fetal tachycardia is defined as a baseline FHR above 16o beats/min, whereas this tracing shows FHR below 16o beats/min.
option C: Beat-to-beat variability is the change in baseline fetal heart rate (excluding the
accelerations and decelerations) in response to sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation. A beat-to-beat variability of 6-25 beats/min is considered normal. This tracing shows normal
beat-to-beat variability.
option D: Cardiotocography (CTG) includes tracings for fetal heart rate and uterine contractions.",6083-3807.PNG,A,
Q38,The given image depicts:,"a)Succenturiate lobe
b)velamentous insertion of the cord
c)Both succenturiate lobe and velamentous insertion
d)Normal placenta","The abnormal placenta shown in the image depicts both succenturiate lobe and velamentous insertion of the cord.


The umbilical cord is usually attached at or near the center of the placenta.



In the velamentous placenta, the cord is attached to the membranes. The cord vessels traverse
between the membranes for some distance before reaching the placenta. If the leash of blood
vessels traverses through the membranes overlying the internal os, in front of the presenting part, the condition is called vasa previa. The rupture of the membranes involving the overlying vessels   leads to vaginal bleeding and fetal exsanguination.
The below image shows the velamentous placenta:


The succenturiate placenta is characterized by the presence of one or more small lobes of placenta placed at varying distances from the main placental margins. A leash of blood vessels connects
these accessory cotyledons to the main placenta. If these vessels are absent, then it is called placenta spuria. If the succenturiate lobe is retained postpartum, there can be primary or
secondary postpartum hemorrhage, subinvolution of the uterus, uterine sepsis, and polyp formation.
The below image shows a succenturiate placenta.  L1, L2 and L3 depict smaller lobes, Uc is the umbilical cord, and M is the intervening membrane.",6084-3808.PNG,C,6119-3816.PNG;6120-3817.PNG;6120-3817-1.png
Q39,which hormone is secreted by placenta?,"a)LH
b)hcG
c)FSH
d)GnRH","Human chorionic gonadotropin (hcG) is the hormone secreted by the placenta.
hcG is a glycoprotein, produced by the syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta and secreted into the   blood of both mother and fetus. It can be detected in the maternal serum or urine as early as 8–9 days postfertilization, with the help of radioimmunoassay. In early pregnancy, hcG
concentrations in plasma double in 1.4–2 days.
Functions of hcG:
• stimulates the secretion of progesterone by the corpus luteum: Rescue and maintenance of the corpus luteum till 6 weeks of pregnancy is the major biological function of hcG.
• stimulate Leydig cells of the male fetus to produce testosterone.
• stimulates both adrenal and placental steroidogenesis.
• stimulates the maternal thyroid because of its thyrotropic activity.
• promotes secretion of relaxin from the corpus luteum.
High levels of hcG for that particular gestational age are detected in multiple pregnancies, hydatidiform mole or choriocarcinoma, and in pregnancy with a trisomy 21 fetus (Down’s   syndrome). It is low in cases of ectopic pregnancy or abortion.
other options:
option A: LH is secreted by the gonadotrope cells of the anterior pituitary.
option c: FsH is also secreted by the gonadotrope cells of the anterior pituitary.
option D: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) regulates the synthesis and secretion of both the hormones, LH and FsH.",,B,
Q40,Antepartum hemorrhage due to abruption shows all except:,"a)uterine tenderness
b)Frequent contractions
c)painless vaginal bleeding
d)Mild to moderate vaginal bleeding","painless vaginal bleeding is not a feature of abruption of the placenta.
patients with placental abruption present with sudden-onset abdominal pain, vaginal
bleeding, uterine tenderness, and frequent contractions. painless vaginal bleeding can occur in
placenta previa where the placenta is implanted in the lower uterine segment over or very close to the cervical os.
Abruptio placenta is the partial/total separation of a normally implanted placenta before delivery. The bleeding may be
• Revealed (blood dissects downwards between membranes and uterine wall to escape through the cervix), or
• concealed (blood accumulates between detached placenta and uterus), or



Mixed
Risk factors for abruptio placenta include prior abruption history, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and pregnancy-associated hypertension. Depending upon the degree of placental
abruption and its clinical effects, the cases are graded as follows:
uteroplacental apoplexy/couvelaire uterus is a complication of severe concealed abruptio
placentae. There is massive intravasation of blood into the uterine musculature up to the serous coat. It is only diagnosed on laparotomy, where a port-wine-colored uterus (diffuse or patchy) is seen. The presence of  couvelaire uterus alone is not an indication of hysterectomy since it does not interfere with uterine contractions.
other complications of abruption of placenta:
Disseminated intravascular coagulation
Hypovolemic shock due to torrential bleeding Acute kidney injury
Abruptio placenta is mostly managed by immediate delivery and management of complications such as shock with adequate blood products.

Grade 1	Grade 2	Grade 3
Slight vaginal bleeding	Mild to moderate vaginal ble eding	Bleeding is moderate to sever e or concealed.
Minimal uterine tenderness	uterine tenderness is always present	Marked uterine tenderness
Maternal BP and fibrinogen will be unaffected	Increased maternal pulse, bu t BP is maintained, fibrinoge n levels may be decreased	BP decreases, associated coag ulation defect or anuria may   complicate
FHS good	Fetal distress present	Fetal deathoccurs
Maternal shock absent	Maternal shock absent	Pronounced shock",,C,

Goodell s sign is a sign of early pregnancy, which describes the marked softening of the cervix in contrast to the non-pregnant state. It is seen as early as the 6th week.
osiander's sign describes the pulsations felt in the lateral fornix due to increased vascularity. It is seen around 8 weeks of gestation.
Internal ballottement can be elicited between 16  28th weeks of gestation, before which the fetus is too small and after which it is too large to displace. It may not be elicited in cases with scanty  liquor amnii, or when the fetus is transversely placed.
Lightening is a sense of relief of the pressure symptoms due to the engagement of the presenting part. It is felt at about 38 weeks of gestation.",,B,
Q42,The non-contraceptive uses of oral contraceptives include all of the following except:,"a)Reduction in the risk of ovarian cancer
b)Ectopic pregnancy
c)protection against sexually transmitted diseases including HIV
d)Reduction in the risk of endometrial cancer","The non-contraceptive uses of oral contraceptives include all except protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV.
oral hormonal contraceptives can be combined oral contraceptive pills (cocps) or
progesterone-only minipills.
cocps are a combination of ethinylestradiol at a dose of 2o–3o mcg and an orally active
progestogen. It is taken starting on the first day of the cycle for 21 days. They are taken at a fixed   time of the day, preferably after a meal. Mala-N and Mala-D both contain levonorgestrel (o.15 mg) + ethinylestradiol (3o mcg). Mala-N is supplied free of cost in Family planning clinics in India.
Each strip contains 21 hormonal tablets and 7 non-hormonal (iron) tablets.
The mechanism of action is the prevention of ovulation by suppression of the pituitary
hormones FSH and LH. progesterone also acts on the cervical mucus, making it thick and impenetrable by sperm. The pregnancy rate with the cocp is o.3 per 1oo woman-years.
Benefits of the cocp:
• It is effective in controlling fertility.
• It causes regular cycles and reduces menstrual blood loss and are, therefore, useful in menorrhagia and polymenorrhea.
• It lowers the incidence of benign breast neoplastic diseases, such as fibrocystic disease.
• It reduces the incidence of functional ovarian cysts and ovarian (option A) and endometrial   malignancy (option D). The incidence of ovarian cancer is reduced by 4o% and that of uterine malignancy, by 5o%, if taken for 1 year; this effect lasts as long as 1o years after stoppage.
• It reduces the incidence of ectopic pregnancy (option B) by suppressing ovulation and reducing the risk in pelvic inflammatory disease.
• It is useful in endometriosis, acne, and polycystic ovarian disease (pcoD).
Side effects:
• Higher incidence of breast cancer reported among users
• Suppression of lactation
• occurrence of pituitary adenoma and adenoma of the liver
• Reduced carbohydrate tolerance (therefore, contraindicated in diabetic women)
• Migraine, depression, weight gain, and lethargy (due to progesterone)
• Increased risk of pulmonary embolism and cerebral thrombosis
Ninety-nine percent of women will regain normal menstrual cycles within 6 months of stopping the pills, while the return of fertility is slightly delayed.

b)Kallmann syndrome
c)Androgen insensitivity syndrome
d)Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome","The patient’s clinical features are strongly suggestive of Turner syndrome.
Turner's syndrome is the most common sex chromosome abnormality in females. The classical karyotype is 45, Xo. It is characterized by hypogonadism in phenotypic females.
The clinical features of Turner’s syndrome include short stature, short webbed neck, shield chest with widely spaced nipples, primary amenorrhea, congenital heart defects, and renal
anomalies. Two X chromosomes are required for the development of ovaries. The loss of one X  chromosome results in streak ovaries with inadequate estrogen production. The loss of negative feedback from reduced estrogen raises the FSH and LH levels causing hypergonadotropic
hypogonadism.


other options:
option B: Kallmnann syndrome presents with delayed puberty due to hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism from deficiency of GnRH. It is associated with olfactory dysfunction and anosmia.
option C: Androgen insensitivity syndrome occurs due to a defect in the androgen receptor in a genotypic male (Xy). These individuals are phenotypic females with no male or female internal  genitalia. They have normal female external genitalia with an absent or shallow
vagina, well-developed breasts, and scanty body hair (axillary and pubic) and are present with primary amenorrhea.
option D: Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, commonly referred to as
Mullerian agenesis, has primary amenorrhea due to failure of development of the uterus, cervix, and upper vagina. They have normally functioning gonads and external genitalia.",,A,6120-3817-2.png

AMTSL is recommended by the WHO to prevent postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). uterotonic
administration is the most important component in AMTSL. However, even before a uterotonic is  administered, the birth attendant will often place their hand over the uterus to ensure that there is no undiagnosed twin.
The currently recommended components of AMTSL are as follows:
Note: uterine massage or fundal massage is not recommended as an intervention to prevent PPH in women who have already received prophylactic uterotonics such as oxytocin (core component   of AMTSL). Hence, it is now an optional component of AMTSL that is done in patients with
uterine atony as a part of the management of PPH.

Q45,A surgically resected specimen of an ovarian mass is is shown below. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)Immature teratoma
b)Mature cystic teratoma
c)Mucinous cystadenoma
d)serous cystadenoma","The specimen showing an ovarian mass with a tuft of hair in a cystic space is a mature cystic teratoma.
Teratomas are germ cell tumors. They contain embryonic tissues leading to the differentiation of cells along these pathways. There are three classes of teratomas:
• Mature (benign) teratomas (e.g.: dermoid cyst)
• Immature (essentially malignant) teratomas (e.g.: solid teratoma)
• Monodermal (highly specialized) tumors (e.g.: struma ovarii)
Mature cystic teratomas, also known as dermoid cysts are unilocular, containing sebaceous   material and hair. They have a smooth surface and are lined by squamous epithelium. Other structures like teeth, bone, cartilage, thyroid tissue, and neural tissues can also be found.
Most patients are asymptomatic. common presentations include abdominal mass, acute pain due to torsion of the ovary, and rarely due to rupture of the cyst with spillage of contents into the



abdomen.
Treatment of mature teratomas involves excision in order to prevent complications.
option A - Immature teratomas of the ovary are solid and trabeculated. They also contain
cartilage, bone, hair, and sebaceous material. There is no structural order. They are generally
malignant. Grossly, they have a smooth external surface and are solid on sectioning. There may be areas of necrosis or hemorrhage.
The following image shows both mature (left) and immature teratomas (right).


option C- Mucinous cystadenoma is a benign tumor showing multicystic appearance, delicate septa, and the presence of glistening mucin within the cyst.
option D- serous cystadenoma have multicystic lesion in which papillary epithelium is contained within fibrous walled cysts or as a mass projecting from the ovarian surface.",6086-3809.PNG,B,6126-3818.PNG
Q46,which of the following is seen in placenta previa?,"a)warning bleeds
b)Dark painful bleeding
c)uterine tenderness
d)Increased/large uterine size","Among the given options, placenta previa shows warning bleeds.
Dark painful bleeding with a tender uterus that is disproportionately enlarged is seen in placental abruption.
placenta previa is a condition where the placenta is implanted in the lower uterine segment either over or close to the internal cervical os.
Risk factors for placenta previa
• Multigravida
• Age &gt; 35 years
• smoking
• previous cesarean section or myomectomy



• Abnormal placental size and lobes
• prior curettage
clinical features of placenta previa:
• sudden-onset recurrent painless vaginal bleeding: First bleeding usually appears after the end of the second trimester or later and is usually mild and not fatal. This is called ‘sentinel bleed’.  In
about one third of cases, there is a history of ‘warning hemorrhage’ which is usually slight.
• The size of the uterus corresponds to gestational age.
• The uterus is relaxed, soft, no tenderness
• Floating head
• Fetal heart sound is present unless there is major separation and the patient is exsanguinated.
• slowing of fetal heart rate on pressing the head down into the pelvis which recovers promptly as pressure is relieved is suggestive of a low-lying placenta especially of posterior type: stallworthy     sign.
Degree of placenta previa:
There are four types of placenta previa depending upon the degree of extension of the placenta to the lower segment
• Type—I (Low-lying): The major part of the placenta is attached to the upper segment and only the lower margin encroaches onto the lower segment but not up to the internal os.
• Type—II (Marginal): The placenta reaches the margin of the internal os but does not cover it.
• Type—III (Incomplete or partial central): The placenta covers the internal os partially (covers the
internal os when closed but does not entirely do so when fully dilated).
• Type—IV (central or total): The placenta completely covers the internal os even after it is fully dilated.
per-Vaginal Examination should not be done in suspected placenta previa, whereas it can be only done in the operation theatre with all the arrangements for c-section.
The image below shows the types of placenta previa.





Expectant management for placenta previa was advocated by Macafee and Johnson. The aim is to continue the pregnancy for fetal maturity without compromising maternal health.
prerequisites
• Availability of blood for transfusion whenever required
• Facilities for cesarean section should be available 24 h.
Suitable cases for expectant management for placenta previa:
• Mother in good health (Hb ≥1o g%; hematocrit ≥3o%)
• Duration of pregnancy &lt;37 wk
• No active vaginal bleeding
• Fetal well-being is assured (USG) conduct of expectant treatment
• corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity if &lt;34 wk
• Betamethasone 12mg IM 24 hours apart for 2 doses or
• Dexamethasone 6mg IM 12 hours apart for 4 doses
• Bedrest
• Hb, Blood grouping and urine for protein
• Inspection of vulval pads, fetal surveillance with USG
• Supplementary hematinics
• Rh Immunoglobin should be given to all Rh-negative (unsensitized) women
• Use of tocolytics if there are uterine contractions.

b)Administer tocolytics and deliver at 37 wks
c)Give steroid cover and wait until steroid cover is complete.
d)Treat hypertension, administer MgSO4, and consider termination of pregnancy.","The pregnant woman exhibiting features of severe pre-eclampsia (BP of 17o/11o mmHg, epigastric pain, headache, and blurring of vision) and in active labor should be managed by treating
hypertension, administering Mgso4 (magnesium sulfate), and considering termination of pregnancy.
Preeclampsia is defined as hypertension with blood pressure ≥14o/9o mm Hg along with proteinuria that develops after 2o weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive and    non-proteinuric woman. It can be classified as severe if any of the following are present:
• BP ≥16o/11o
• Headache
• visual disturbance
• upper abdominal pain
• Elevated creatinine
• Thrombocytopenia (&lt;1,oo,ooo cells per mm3)
• Pulmonary edema
• Marked elevation in serum transaminases
This patient has many features of severe pre-eclampsia and is in active labor. The best
management for her is to admit her and bring down her BP using labetalol, nifedipine, or
hydralazine and give seizure prophylaxis with magnesium sulfate in the same way as in eclampsia. since the placenta is the main pathology causing pre-eclampsia, termination of pregnancy and
delivery of the placenta is the definitive treatment.",,D,

Perimortem cesarean section is an emergency cesarean delivery of a woman who is expected to die within the next few moments or has just died. AHA 2o2o Guidelines for CPR recommend that
perimortem cesarean should be considered if there is no return of spontaneous circulation in 5 minutes in a pregnant woman who has experienced total cardiopulmonary arrest.
The goal of perimortem cesarean section (PMCS) is to improve maternal and fetal outcomes.
PMCS improve maternal survival by decreasing compression ofthe IvC by the gravid uterus. This improves venous return and diaphragmatic displacement, which in turn improves respiratory
dynamics. The infant may survive if PMCS is done within 1o minutes of maternal death. A classical upper-segment cesarean section with a vertical uterine incision is done.
