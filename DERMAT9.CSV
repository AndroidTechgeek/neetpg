Q1,A 1o-year-old male child complains of mild painful swelling over the scalp for 3 months as shown in the image below. He also has a pet dog at his home. what is the diagnosis of the given condition?,"a)Furuncle
b)Epidermoid cyst
c)kerion
d)Folliculitis","The clinical vignette of a young boy in contact with a zoophilic organism, presenting with
a boggy inflammatory mass, with thick crusting and matting of hair is suggestive of a kerion.
kerion is a severe inflammatory type of tinea capitis.
Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection primarily occurring in children. clinical features of tinea capitis are patchy hair loss, scaling, tender lymphadenopathy, and in severe cases, there might be  pustules and crusting of the affected area along with sinus formation.
The clinical variants of tinea capitis are:



• Endothrix - a non-inflammatory type in which multiple black dots are present within the areas of alopecia. It is most commonly caused by T. tonsurans and T. violaceum.
• Ectothrix - a mild inflammatory type in which single or multiple scaly patches with hair loss are seen. Microsporum audouinii, M.canis, M.equinnum, and M.ferrugineum cause ectothrix
infection.
• kerion - a severe inflammatory type that presents with an inflammatory mass with thick crusting and matting of hair with pus and sinus formation. It is commonly caused by T.    verrucosum and T. mentagrophytes.
• Favus - is characterized by the presence of yellowish, cup■shaped crusts known as scutula that develop around hair follicles. It is caused by T. schoenleinii.
Treatment:
• Terbinafine: &lt;1o kg- 62.5 mg; 1o-2o kg - 125 mg; &gt;2o kg- 25o mg, all given daily for 4 weeks.
• Itraconazole: 2-4 mg/kg/day for 4-6 weeks.
The image below shows a kerion:


The image below shows the endothrix variant of tinea capitis:





option A: Furuncle/ boil is caused by staphylococcus. It is painful and usually situated on the
neck area, and the shedding of loosened hairs is generally much less evident than in kerion. It is pustular and later becomes necrotic and forms a scar.
The image below shows a furuncle- pustule over the hair follicle with a necrotic base:


option B: Epidermoid cyst/ sebaceous cyst results from squamous metaplasia in a damaged
sebaceous gland. Many are the result of inflammation around a pilosebaceous follicle. The most   common site of a sebaceous cyst is the postauricular sulcus or below and behind the ear lobule.    They are fixed to the skin and usually have a central punctum. Treatment depends on the clinical state of the cyst. when inflamed or infected, they should be incised and drained initially, total
surgical excision should be done once the inflammation has subsided.
The image below shows an epidermoid cyst of the post-auricular sulcus- cyst fixed to the skin, shows a central punctum:





option D: Folliculitis would involve specific inflammation in the pilosebaceous units. It is caused by staphylococcus aureus. They heal without a scar.
The image below shows folliculitis- inflammation of the pilosebaceous units leading to pustule formation:",3639-2317.PNG,C,3643-2320.PNG;3644-2322.PNG;3644-2321.PNG;3645-2324.PNG;3645-2323.PNG
Q2,A child with a history of night-blindness presented to you with the following findings. what is the diagnosis?,"a)phrynoderma
b)keratosis pilaris
c)Darier disease
d)Follicular eczema","A child having night-blindness, and multiple keratotic papules on elbows as shown in the image    suggests a diagnosis of phrynoderma or toad-skin. This can occur due to the deficiency of vitamin A.
phrynoderma is not specific to vitamin A deficiency. It may also be associated with deficiencies of B complex, riboflavin, vitamin C, vitamin E, and essential fatty acids. It manifests as groups of



papules with a central keratotic plug. The commonest sites are elbows and knees. They are
present around the follicles and give the skin a rough texture. Treatment involves the correction of poor diet and administration of a multivitamin preparation containing vitamin A.
option B: keratosis pilaris is an inherited abnormality of keratinization. It affects the follicular
orifices leading to keratotic follicular plugging, perifollicular erythema, and follicular atrophy. It   usually presents during puberty. They present as small, keratotic papules on the extensor aspects of the limbs, particularly the arms which can lead to ingrowing of the hair. Treatment is purely     reserved for cosmetic purposes.


option C: Darier disease is an autosomal dominant genodermatosis characterized by keratotic    papules that show acantholysis and dyskeratosis. ATP2A2 gene mutations are present in Darier disease. Histologically, acantholysis (separation of keratinocytes) and blistering are seen in the   suprabasal epidermis.
It presents with discrete or confluent rough, greasy, skin-colored papules in seborrheic areas
(trunk, face scalp margins) and flexures (perineum, axillae, groin). There may also be isolated
nipple hyperkeratosis. Nail findings include fragility, painful longitudinal splits, or distinctive red and white longitudinal bands terminating in V-shaped nicks.











option D: Follicular eczema is a form of atopic dermatitis that presents with a discoid patch   formed due to the coalescence of the follicular lesions with peripheral excoriation marks. The biopsy shows spongiotic dermatitis.",extra1.png,A,Picture39.png;3647-2327.PNG;3647-2326.PNG;3647-2325.PNG
Q3,A 3o-year-old presented with flaccid bullae on her skin which are easy to rupture. The biopsy revealed a suprabasal split. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)pemphigus vulgaris
b)pemphigus foliaceus
c)pemphigus vegetans
d)Erythema multiforme","The given clinical vignette of a bullous disorder with the histologic picture pointing towards a suprabasal blister suggests the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris.
It is caused due to the production of antibodies mainly against desmoglein 3. Rarely antibodies
against desmoglein 1 can also be found. The antibodies are commonly IgG antibodies. Desmoglein 3 is mainly present in the basal and suprabasal layers of the skin and mucosa.
The patients, therefore, present with flaccid bullae over the skin and mucosal ulcerations. oral mucosa is commonly affected. other areas where ulceration can be seen are conjunctiva,
nasopharynx, larynx, etc. cutaneous lesions are more common over the scalp, face, neck, upper chest, and back.
Direct immunofluorescence will show the deposition of antibodies around the keratinocytes in the epidermis. It presents with a characteristic fish-net appearance in
the immunofluorescence assay It is treated with steroids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, etc.
The images attached below depict the lesions, the suprabasal split, and the fish-net pattern respectively seen in a case of pemphigus vulgaris.


option B: pemphigus foliaceus is a benign form of pemphigus, an inflammatory blistering
disorder. This is a form of a subcorneal blister, where the stratum corneum forms the roof of the bulla. It is caused by autoantibodies that result in the dissolution of intercellular attachments
within the epidermis. Antibodies against desmoglein 1 are mainly seen in pemphigus    foliaceous. There is no involvement of the mucosal epithelium in pemphigus foliaceus.



Lesions are most common on the scalp, face, chest, and back. Bullae are superficial and mainly   present as areas of erythema and crusting. These represent superficial erosions at sites of blister rupture.


option C: pemphigus vegetans is a rare form of the bullous disorder that presents with large, moist, verrucous, vegetating plaques studded with pustules on the groin, axillae,
and flexural surfaces. It is associated with eosinophilic microabscess. It has two types, a severe Neumann type, and a milder Hallopeau type.


option D: Erythema multiforme is a self■limiting cytotoxic dermatitis resulting from
cell■mediated hypersensitivity most commonly to infection or drugs. The common triggers are • Herpes simplex infection
• Mycoplasma infection
• Bacterial infections



• Fungal infections
• vaccinations
• Malignancy: carcinoma, lymphoma, leukemia
• Drug reactions: sulfonamides, cotrimoxazole, penicillins
• Miscellaneous: Lupus erythematosus (Rowell syndrome), sarcoidosis, polyarteritis Nodosa
It presents clinically with macular, papular, or urticarial lesions, along with the classic acral
iris or target lesions. The lesions are distributed on the distal extremities, palms or trunk, and oral and genital mucous membranes.
Target lesions are less than 3 cm in diameter, rounded, and have three zones:
• The central area of dusky erythema or purpura
• Middle paler zone of edema
• The outer ring of erythema with a well■defined edge
Atypical lesions will have only 2 zones. They fade in 1-2 weeks leaving dusky discoloration.",,A,3648-2328.PNG;3649-2330.PNG;3649-2329.PNG;3650-2331.PNG
Q4,"what is the treatment of choice for a patient with paronychia of the index finger on the right hand, as shown in the image below?","a)Amoxiclav
b)Metronidazole
c)Amikacin
d)Norfloxacin","The above image depicts paronychia associated with a reddish erythematous streak-like lesion on the hand suggestive of paronychia associated with lymphangitis. The treatment of choice for this  patient is amoxiclav.
Acute paronychia is an acute infection of the nail beds and folds. It is most commonly caused by staphylococcus aureus. It presents as a tender, erythematous swelling around the nail.
Treatment of pyogenic paronychia:
• protection against trauma
• keep affected fingernails dry.



• Abscesses - Incision and drainage. (abscess is often opened by pushing the nail fold away from the nail plate)
• Antibiotics- A penicillin in combination with a β-lactamase inhibitor, e.g. amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (Amoxiclav)
chronic paronychia is usually due to infection with candida albicans and responds to topical antifungal therapy.
Lymphangitis:
Lymphangitis represents acute inflammation elicited by the spread of bacterial infections into
lymphatics, with group A β-hemolytic streptococci being the most common causative agent. It is manifested by red, painful subcutaneous streaks (the inflamed lymphatics) and painful
enlargement of the draining lymph nodes (lymphadenitis). It is managed by elevating the affected extremity and broad-spectrum antibiotics.",3641-2319.PNG,A,
Q5,A patient taking multi-drug therapy (MDT) presents with worsening of existing lesions and nerve involvement. what will be your next best step of action?,"a)stop MDT, start systemic corticosteroids
b)continue MDT, start systemic steroids
c)stop MDT give thalidomide
d)continue MDT, start thalidomide","The given scenario of worsening of existing lesions in the context of leprosy treatment with multi-drug therapy (MDT) is suggestive of a type 1 lepra reaction. The next best step in the  management would be to continue MDT and start systemic steroids.
Type 1 lepra reactions present with inflammation of existing skin lesions. The lesions become red, painful, and edematous. They may rarely ulcerate. New lesions may occur but are very rare. It is    associated with acute neuritis, with the tenderness and loss of sensory and motor function.
MDT is never stopped in patients with lepra reactions. For pain, NSAIDs can be supplemented along with oral steroids.
The use of thalidomide is restricted to severe forms of type-2 lepra reaction or erythema nodosum leprosum. These are characterized by systemic effects like iritis, orchitis, and eruption of new skin lesions.
The summary of lepra reactions is attached in the pearl below.",3641-2318.PNG,B,
Q6,A 3o-year-old male patient presents to you with inflammatory alopecia. which of the following variants of tinea capitis infection commonly result in this type of alopecia?,"a)Endothrix and Favus
b)Ectothrix and Endothrix
c)Favus and kerion
d)kerion and Endothrix","Favus and kerion are the inflammatory variants of tinea capitis.
Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection primarily occurring in children. clinical features of tinea capitis are patchy hair loss, scaling, tender lymphadenopathy, and in severe cases, there might be  pustules and crusting of the affected area along with sinus formation.
The clinical variants of tinea capitis are:
• kerion is a severe inflammatory type of tinea capitis which presents with an inflammatory mass with thick crusting and matting of hair.
• Favus is characterized by the presence of yellowish, cup■shaped crusts known as scutula that develop around hair follicles.



• Endothrix is a non inflammatory type in which black dots form around swollen hair shafts.
• Ectothrix is a mild inflammatory type in which dull grey coated broken hairs is seen.",,C,
