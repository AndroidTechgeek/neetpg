Q1,A patient comes with complaints of difficulty falling asleep. He consumes black coffee one hour before bed. which of the following is the role of caffeine in the wakefulness?,"a)caffeine has no effect, and he can continue taking black coffee
b)caffeine causes release of chemical from locus coeruleus that causes awakening
c)caffeine has histaminic action in brain that leads to awakening
d)caffeine inhibits adenosine receptors, thus leading to awakening","The role of caffeine in the wakefulness in this patient is that caffeine inhibits adenosine receptors, thus leading to awakening.
caffeine, a commonly used stimulant, plays a significant role in promoting wakefulness and alertness. It functions primarily as an antagonist at adenosine A2A receptors in the brain.
Adenosine, a natural neuromodulator which accumulates in the basal forebrain area promotes sleepiness and relaxation by activating these receptors. By blocking adenosine A2A receptors,  caffeine counteracts these sedative effects, thus helping to increase wakefulness and reduce
fatigue.
In addition to its receptor antagonism, caffeine inhibits cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, which leads to increased levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in the brain. This action enhances the    release of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA), further
contributing to increased neural activity and alertness. caffeine is rapidly absorbed from the digestive tract and crosses the blood-brain barrier easily, affecting brain function soon after   consumption.
caffeine's stimulating effects can also be influenced by factors such as metabolism, which varies widely among individuals. For instance, smoking can reduce caffeine's half-life, making it clear
from the body faster, while oral contraceptives can prolong its effects. Therefore, consuming
caffeine close to bedtime, as in the case of drinking black coffee an hour before bed, can interfere with sleep by sustaining wakefulness and reducing the ability to fall asleep.",,D,
Q2,which of the following sNRI is used in the treatment of ADHD?,"a)Guanfacine
b)Methylphenidate
c)Reboxetine
d)Modafinil","The SNRI that can be used for the treatment of ADHD is Reboxetine.
Reboxetine, a SNRI has shown potential efficacy in treating ADHD, particularly in patients who do not respond to methylphenidate. common side effects of reboxetine include drowsiness,
sedation, and gastrointestinal issues.
In the treatment of ADHD , pharmacotherapy is the primary approach, with central nervous system (cNS) stimulants being the most effective. Stimulants such as methylphenidate and   amphetamine salts are commonly used due to their high efficacy in managing symptoms,



although they come with risks of dependence and addiction. For patients who cannot tolerate stimulants or have a family history of addiction, non-stimulant options are preferred. These    include atomoxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), and guanfacine, an alpha-2   adrenergic agonist.
Modafinil is used primarily for narcolepsy and is not a standard treatment for ADHD.",,C,
Q3,"A 45-year-old woman presents with a feeling of nervousness and has abdominal pain and
diarrhoea. she has had a history of heartburn, and indigestion for the past 25 years. she gives similar complaints in the family of being ""tense and nervous"". what other symptoms might
you expect to see in this condition?","a)Tingling of extremities
b)Neologism
c)Idea of reference
d)Hallucination","In this scenario, given the patient's feelings of nervousness, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and a history of long-term digestive issues along with familial history, you might also expect to see   tingling of extremities as a symptom of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).
According to DSM-5 (and ICD-11) criteria, GAD is characterized by excessive and uncontrollable anxiety and worry about various aspects of life, persisting for at least six months. This anxiety is typically accompanied by at least three additional symptoms from a specific list, which includes:
• The presence of excessive anxiety and worry about a variety of topics, events, or activities.
• worry occurs more often than not for at least six months and is clearly excessive.
• The worry is experienced as very challenging to control.
• The worry in both adults and children may easily shift from one topic to another.
• The anxiety and worry are accompanied by at least three of the following physical or cognitive symptoms (In children, only one of these symptoms is necessary for a diagnosis of GAD):
• Edginess or restlessness
• Tiring easily; more fatigued than usual impaired concentration or feeling as though the mind goes blank
• Irritability (which may or may not be observable to others)
• Increased muscle aches or soreness
• Difficulty sleeping (due to trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, restlessness at night, or unsatisfying sleep)
Neologism, idea of reference, and hallucinations are not typical symptoms of GAD but are more associated with other psychiatric conditions such as psychotic disorders like schizophrenia.",,A,
Q4,"A girl was referred to the psychiatry department by the plastic surgeon. she had visited
multiple plastic surgery departments requesting full facial reconstruction. she complains of   dark blemishes and spots on her face, which are not present. she always says that she is ugly and looks constantly in the mirror and the back of the spoon and windows. Her mother
assured her of no such issues, but still, she persists in getting the surgery. what should the psychiatrist do?","a)start on atypical antipsychotics
b)Give fitness for surgery
c)start her on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
d)Initiate insight-oriented psychotherapy","The given history suggests the presence of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) in the patient, as she is preoccupied with her appearance and self-perceived flaws, despite being told otherwise by her   family. The psychiatrist should start her on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRI).
BDD is characterized by persistent preoccupations about one or more perceived defects or flaws in one’s appearance, but the defects or flaws are negligible or not even observable to others. In
response to their appearance concerns, individuals with BDD demonstrate a range of mental acts:



• comparing themselves with others
• checking in the mirror
• camouflaging their perceived flaws
• Avoidance- from minor social avoidance to being housebound.
The specific focus of BDD on appearance serves to differentiate it from other conditions
characterized by repetitive behaviours.
The treatment for BDD typically involves a combination of SSRIs and psychotherapy. SSRIs, such as fluoxetine and clomipramine, have been shown to reduce symptoms in many patients, helping  alleviate the obsessive thoughts and anxiety associated with BDD.
psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioural therapy (cBT), is crucial as it addresses the
distorted self-image and underlying emotional issues. cBT helps patients reframe their thoughts about appearance and develop healthier coping strategies.
It's important to note that while surgical interventions may be sought by patients, they are often ineffective and can lead to further dissatisfaction and distress. Therefore, focusing on mental
health treatment is essential. Regular follow-ups and a supportive therapeutic relationship can significantly enhance the effectiveness of treatment.
other options:
option A: Start on atypical antipsychotics: Antipsychotics are generally not the first-line treatment for BDD. They may be considered in cases with comorbid psychotic symptoms, but this patient
does not exhibit hallucinations or delusions.
option B: Give fitness for surgery: Giving fitness for surgery would be inappropriate and
potentially harmful. Surgery is not the solution for BDD, as patients typically remain dissatisfied with the results and continue seeking more surgeries.
option D: Initiate insight-oriented psychotherapy: while psychotherapy, particularly
cognitive-behavioral therapy (cBT), is effective for BDD, insight-oriented psychotherapy (focused on understanding unconscious conflicts) is less effective than targeted approaches like cBT in
managing this condition.",,C,
Q5,A girl presented with multiple episodes of loss of consciousness. The episodes usually happen in the presence of the family members in the morning. she regains consciousness after 15 to   3o minutes and usually remembers the events during these episodes. There is no history of     tongue bite or urinary incontinence. what should be done in this scenario?,"a)start behavioural therapy
b)Initiate aversion therapy
c)Give valproate
d)start on ketogenic diet","In this scenario, the girl is experiencing episodes of loss of consciousness that may suggest
conversion disorder. The most appropriate management is to start behavioural therapy to help address her symptoms and underlying stressors.
conversion disorder, also referred to as functional neurological symptom disorder in the DSM-5,   involves symptoms or deficits that affect voluntary motor or sensory functions, suggesting another medical condition. However, these symptoms are believed to arise from psychological factors,
often triggered by conflicts or stressors. The symptoms are not intentionally produced, are not the result of substance use, and are not limited to pain or sexual issues. The primary gain associated    with conversion disorder is psychological rather than social, monetary, or legal.
common presenting symptoms include:



• Non-epileptic seizures
• weakness and/or paralysis
• Movement disorders
• speech or visual impairment
• swallowing difficulty
• sensory disturbances
• cognitive symptoms
Resolution of conversion disorder symptoms often occurs spontaneously but can be enhanced
through supportive or behavioural therapy. For patients who are resistant to psychotherapy, it can be beneficial to focus on stress and coping strategies rather than directly addressing their
symptoms as imaginary, as this may exacerbate their condition.
Additional techniques, such as hypnosis, anxiolytics, and behavioural relaxation exercises, may
also be effective in managing symptoms. In certain cases, medications like parenteral amobarbital or lorazepam can help gather further information, especially if the patient has experienced a
recent traumatic event.
psychodynamic approaches, including psychoanalysis and insight-oriented psychotherapy, allow patients to explore their internal conflicts and the symbolic meanings of their symptoms.",,A,
Q6,"If a child with ADHD goes untreated into adolescence, what is he most likely to develop?","a)selective mutism
b)separation anxiety disorder
c)conduct disorder
d)Binge eating disorder","If a child with ADHD goes untreated into adolescence, among the following options he is most likely to develop conduct disorder.
The course of ADHD is variable. The majority of the cases persist into adult life. The hyperactivity may sometimes disappear, but the decreased attention span and impulse-control problems usually persist. patients with ADHD are vulnerable to conduct disorder, antisocial behaviour, substance     use disorders, and mood disorders.
ADHD is a neuro psychiatric condition characterized by a pattern of diminished attention span
and increased impulsivity or hyperactivity. The prefrontal cortex of the brain has been implicated in its etiology and dopamine is the main neurotransmitter.
ADHD can begin during infancy but is usually recognized between 1-3 years of age. ADHD was
known as minimal brain dysfunction earlier. The characteristics of children with ADHD, in order of frequency, are
• Hyperactivity
• Attention deficit (short attention span, distractibility)
• Impulsivity (action before thought, abrupt shifts in activity, lack of organization)
• Memory and thinking deficits
• specific learning disabilities
• speech and hearing deficits.



According to DSM-5 criteria, a diagnosis of ADHD requires symptoms to be present before age 12, persist for at least six months, negatively impact social, academic, or occupational activities, and    occur in two or more settings. pharmacotherapy is the first-line treatment, with CNS stimulants
like methylphenidate and amphetamine salts being the most effective due to their mild side
effects. Non-stimulant options include atomoxetine, clonidine, and guanfacine. Additionally,
psychosocial interventions—such as academic organization skills, parent training, behaviour
modification, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), and social skills training—are used as adjuncts to medication.
Note: Conduct disorder is characterized by a persistent pattern of behaviour that violates the basic rights of others and disregards societal rules. The severity of the behaviours can lead to
emergencies, especially if they are alarming to parents. Individuals with severe and chronic
symptoms may later be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder after age 18. Treatment   typically involves behaviour modification strategies and, if necessary, placement in a corrective institution.
other options:
option A: Selective mutism refers to the lack of speaking (being mute) in one or more specific
social situations, commonly in school, but speaking well in other situations, commonly at home.  The child may be either completely silent at school or maybe just whispering. Rarely, a child may be silent at home but communicate normally at school.
option B: Separation anxiety disorder is characterized by developmentally inappropriate and excessive anxiety when the patient is separated from their attachment figure. It is a normal
developmental phenomenon in infants. It peaks between 9 months and 18 months and usually diminishes by two and a half years of age.
option D: Binge-eating disorder is the most common eating disorder. It is characterized by rapid intake of abnormally large quantities of food over a short period of time, even when not hungry.   There are feelings of guilt about the eating episodes, but these patients do not compensate in any way following the episodes of binge.",,C,
Q7,A chronic alcoholic met with a vehicular accident. His blood alcohol level is &gt;3oo mg/dl.    He needs hospitalization and will be withheld from taking alcohol. The drug that will be used to manage his withdrawal symptoms is:,"a)Methyl alcohol
b)Fomepizole
c)Lorazepam
d)Buspirone","The first-line drug used in the management of this patient's withdrawal symptoms is
intravenous(Iv) lorazepam.
Delirium tremens is the most severe form of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. It occurs usually   within 3–4 days of alcohol withdrawal.  Acute infection, hepatitis and pancreatitis predispose delirium tremens.
Clinically, patients present with confusion, agitation, and fluctuating levels of consciousness.
visual or tactile hallucinations along with features of autonomic hyperactivity like tachycardia, diaphoresis, fever, insomnia, and hypertension are also seen.
Delirium tremens is treated using benzodiazepines, starting with a higher dosage, which is
gradually tapered as withdrawal symptoms disappear. Benzodiazepines such as Iv lorazepam or oral chlordiazepoxide (every 4 hours) are given.



In the case of benzodiazepine-resistant cases, IV phenobarbital is the first-line drug, and IV propofol is the second-line drug.
It is also recommended to administer thiamine in patients with alcohol-related disorders to prevent wernicke-korsakoff syndrome",,C,
Q8,"A 19-year-old girl child came agitated to the emergency department after consuming some
drug with a previous history of suicidal tendencies. The parents do not know the mode and    route of the drug administered. she presented with tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, and dilated pupils. what is the likely drug administered?","a)chlorpheniramine
b)Morphine
c)Heroin
d)cocaine","In the given clinical scenario, the patient presenting with tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, and dilated pupils after consuming some drug with a previous history of suicidal tendencies points
towards a diagnosis of cocaine toxicity leading to sympathetic toxidrome.
Cocaine is a CNS stimulant obtained from coca plants belonging to the family
Erythroxylaceae. The route of intake is by snorting, IV route and smoking. Tattoos may be made to cover the injection marks.
It inhibits the uptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.
At lower doses, it leads to alertness but at higher doses, it produces stereotyped behavior,
involuntary actions, and paranoia. There is a transient euphoria. Tactile hallucinations (Magnan's symptom or cocaine bugs) are characteristic.
There is a dose-dependent increase in heart rate and blood pressure. It causes dilation of pupils and is associated with chills and perspiration. In severe cases, intracranial bleeding due to
increased blood pressure, and myocardial infarction due to coronary vasospasm can occur.
ultimately, the patient goes into a stage of depression with loss of reflexes, paralysis of muscles, cardiorespiratory failure, and coma.
Management - Administration of activated charcoal and gastric lavage with warm water and potassium permanganate in case of ingestion. Benzodiazepines to control heart rate/seizures.
Amyl nitrite is the antidote given via inhalation. Thiamine 1oo mg IV and Naloxone 2 mg IV can also be given.
other options:
option A: Chlorpheniramine is an effective H1 antagonist that tends to be mildly sedative, making it suitable for daytime use. A notable number of patients experience side effects involving central   nervous system stimulation.
option B and C: Morphine and Heroin are isolated from opium. The clinical features include a
euphoric feeling in the stage of excitement followed by headache, giddiness, and a tendency to
sleep in the stage of stupor. Intoxication is characterized by bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory depression, hypothermia, and pinpoint pupils. Respiratory depression can even result in death.

Q9,"A 19-year-old presented to the psychiatry OPD. He has a charming persona and is
well-composed and behaved in front of interviewers. His mother complains of him getting   into fights and bunking classes, drinking alcohol and getting involved in police cases. what kind of personality disorder does he have?","a)Paranoid
b)Antisocial
c)Narcissistic
d)schizotypal","The patient most likely has antisocial personality disorder. Although the patient seems charming   and well-composed, he is aggressive and clearly exhibits disregard for social norms, and shows no remorse for his actions. These findings are characteristic of antisocial personality disorder.
Antisocial personality Disorder is characterized by a long-term pattern of manipulation,
exploitation, or violation of others' rights. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder tend to show no regard for right or wrong and often disregard the feelings, rights, and safety of others.
other options:
option A: paranoid personality disorder is characterized by unwarranted suspicion, hypersensi-    tivity, jealousy, envy, rigidity, excessive self-importance, and a tendency to blame and ascribe evil motives to others.
option C: Narcissistic personality disorder is marked by a heightened sense of self-importance.
Individuals with this personality disorder display a lack of empathy and grandiose feelings. This is to mask their fragile self-esteem and vulnerability.
option D: Individuals with schizotypal personality disorder appear strange to surrounding people. They have ideas of reference, odd or magical thinking, inappropriate or constricted affect, and
suspiciousness. It is most commonly associated with depression in nearly half of the patients.",,B,
