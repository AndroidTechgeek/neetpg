Q1,A patient is admitted with gastroenteritis. His serum K+ is 2.8 mEq/L. which is not a possible complication of this condition?,"a)Diabetes insipidus
b)cerebral edema
c)Quadriparesis
d)Ventricular tachycardia","This patient's potassium is 2.8mEq/L indicating a hypokalemia. cerebral edema is not a complication associated with hypokalemia, rather it is seen with hyponatremia.
Hypokalemia is defined as a plasma concentration of K+ &lt;3.5 meq/L. common causes include metabolic alkalosis, insulin infusions, diarrhea, use of diuretics, starvation,
β2-agonists,magnesium deficiency, and primary hyperaldosteronism.
Hypokalemia manifests as systemic effects primarily targeting cardiac, skeletal, and intestinal muscles.
• In the cardiovascular system, hypokalemia poses a significant risk for arrhythmias, both  ventricular and atrial. It can lead to ventricular tachycardia which can be fatal. (option D)
• Electrocardiographic alterations characteristic of hypokalemia include the presence of broad flat T waves, ST segment depression, and QT interval prolongation, with pronounced changes
observable when serum potassium levels drop below 2.7 mmol/L.



• Skeletal muscle function is also profoundly affected, as hypokalemia induces hyperpolarization, compromising the muscle's ability to depolarize and contract effectively. Consequently,
individuals may experience weakness and paralysis. (option C)
• Intestinal smooth muscle paralysis is another consequence of hypokalemia, potentially leading to intestinal ileus.
• Prolonged hypokalemia can precipitate acute kidney injury and, in chronic cases related to
underlying conditions such as eating disorders or laxative abuse, contribute to the progression of end-stage renal disease. Hypokalemic polyuria occurs due to a combination of central polydipsia  and an AVP-resistant renal concentrating defect, mimicking nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. This condition leads to the production of large volumes of dilute urine because the kidneys are unable to concentrate urine effectively in response to antidiuretic hormone (ADH).(option A).",,B,
Q2,A man was brought to the emergency department unconscious and hypotensive. His EcG revealed narrow complex tachycardia. what is the next best step in management?,"a)synchronised cardioversion
b)carotid massage
c)IV adenosine 6mg immediately
d)Amiodarone bolus followed by saline infusion","The given clinical scenario and the electrocardiogram (ECG) showing narrow QRS complexes suggest paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). As the patient is hemodynamically  unstable, the next step in management is DC (direct current) cardioversion.
PSVT is a narrow QRS complex tachycardia with sudden onset and termination. They mainly
present with dizziness and palpitations. The evaluation of these patients includes monitoring their vitals and ECG.
Management is as follows:
1) when the patient is hemodynamically stable:
• Carotid sinus massage can be done. It is avoided if carotid bruit is present and if a prior history of stroke is seen
• Valsalva maneuver is done if the patient is cooperative
• Intravenous adenosine is useful in most cases. However, its usage is contraindicated in patients  with prior cardiac transplantation. It can aggravate bronchospasm and atrial fibrillation, hence, it must be used with great caution in such patients.
• Intravenous calcium channel blockers such as verapamil or diltiazem and beta-blockers are helpful but can cause hypotension.





2) when the patient is hemodynamically unstable, i.e., hypotension with unconsciousness or respiratory distress, QRS-synchronous direct current cardioversion is done.",,A,4549-2850.PNG;4549-2852-1.png
Q3,"A 4o year old female patient presents with chest pain and breathlessness. she had a brief
viral illness 1 week ago. Her chest X-ray is given below. what is not true about this condition?","a)Loud s1
b)pulsus paradoxus may be seen
c)Emergency pericardiocentesis may be required
d)ECHO showing diastolic collapse of RA and RV wall during expiration requires immediate intervention","The patient presents with chest pain and breathlessness following a recent viral illness, and her chest X-ray shows a ""water bottle"" sign, indicating a pericardial effusion. In cases of significant  pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade, heart sounds, including the first heart sound S1, are  typically muffled due to the insulating effect of the accumulated fluid around the heart. This
makes it difficult to hear the heart sounds clearly, hence there won't be a loud S1.
pericardial effusion is usually associated with chest pain and/or the ECG changes of pericarditis (widespread ST elevation, often with upward concavity). If the effusion is large, the ECG may
show electrical alternans. Heart sounds may be faint, friction rub, and the apical impulse may not



be audible.
Echocardiography is a widely used imaging technique that allows localization and estimation of the quantity of pericardial fluid.
The chest X-ray shows an enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. It may be normal in small
effusions. The lateral radiograph may show the oreo cookie sign. It is a vertical opaque line
(pericardial fluid) separating a vertical lucent line (paracardial fat) directly behind the sternum anteriorly from a similar lucent vertical line (epicardial fat) posteriorly.
CT and MRI are indicated when echocardiography is inconclusive, when the effusion is loculated or hemorrhagic or if there is pericardial thickening.
other options:
option B: pulsus paradoxus may be seen: This statement is true. pulsus paradoxus, an
exaggerated decrease in systolic blood pressure during inspiration, is commonly seen in patients with massive pericardial effusions.
option C: Emergency pericardiocentesis may be required: This statement is true. In cases of significant pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade, emergency pericardiocentesis is often  necessary to relieve pressure on the heart and prevent hemodynamic compromise.
option D: ECHo showing diastolic collapse of RA and RV wall during expiration requires
immediate intervention: This statement is true. Echocardiographic evidence of diastolic collapse of the RA and RV is a sign of cardiac tamponade, which necessitates immediate intervention.",4533-2844.PNG,A,
Q4,A patient is diagnosed with enterococcal infective endocarditis. He is allergic to penicillin. which of the following is the antibiotic of choice for empiric therapy?,"a)piperacillin
b)Vancomycin
c)Aztreonam
d)Ceftriaxone","This patient with a history of allergy to penicillin and a diagnosis of enterococcal endocarditis should receive vancomycin for the treatment of his endocarditis.
Enterococci are one of the major hospital-acquired pathogens, producing various infections like:
• urinary tract infections
• Bacteremia and mitral valve endocarditis (in intravenous drug abusers)
• Intrabdominal, pelvic and soft tissue infections
• Late-onset neonatal meningitis and sepsis
strains resistant to penicillin and other antibiotics occur frequently, so it is essential to perform antibiotic sensitivity for proper therapy. Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to
cephalosporins(option D) and offer low-level resistance to some aminoglycosides.
In penicillin-sensitive strains, synergism occurs with combination treatment with penicillin and aminoglycosides. In case of high-level resistance, the choice of drug is vancomycin. However, in infections caused by E. faecalis ampicillin is used as a first-line antibiotic as resistance is rare.
Recently vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have begun to emerge. These are treated with linezolid, streptogramins (active against E.faecium, but not to E.faecalis) and daptomycin.
other options:



option B: Piperacillin would be contraindicated in a patient with a penicillin allergy as there is cross-reactivity between the two drugs.
option C: Aztreonam can be used in patients who have enterococci resistant to vancomycin. However, vancomycin is preferred for empiric therapy due to a better side effect profile.",,B,
Q5,which is not used as a diagnostic criterion for diabetic ketoacidosis?,"a)serum glucose&gt;25omg/dl
b)serum potassium &lt;3.5mEq/L
c)serum bicarbonate &lt;15mEq/L
d)ph &lt;7.3","serum potassium &lt;3.5mEq/L is not a diagnostic criterion of diabetic ketoacidosis.
DKA is an acute complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus. It is usually precipitated by absolute or relative insulin deficiency caused by increased metabolic demand (infections) or insulin
noncompliance.
The common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain. The common signs include Kussmaul breathing, fruity odor of the breath, dehydration, tachycardia, hypotension, and delirium.
The diagnosis of DKA is made based on the following parameters:
• Hyperglycemia &gt; 25o mg/dl
• Ketosis or ketones in urine
• Metabolic acidosis with pH &lt; 7.3
• HCo3 &lt; 15-18 mEq/L
• High anion gap due to ketoacids and lactic acidosis
Hyponatremia is seen as a result of hyperglycemia (osmotic shift causes dilutional hyponatremia). Normal sodium levels on admission indicate severe dehydration. Potassium levels at presentation may be normal or elevated despite total body deficit (due to intracellular shift).",,B,
Q6,"A patient presents with complaints of recurrent kidney stones, abdominal pain, and altered mentation. Decreased serum Ca2+ and elevated parathyroid hormone are seen on further    investigation. which of the following disorders explains this patient's condition?","a)Bone - Metabolic bone disorder
b)parathyroid - Hyperparathyroidism
c)Thyroid - Hypothyroidism
d)Adrenal gland - pheochromocytoma","The patient presents with recurrent kidney stones, abdominal pain, and altered mentation, along with laboratory findings of decreased serum calcium (Ca2+) and elevated parathyroid hormone
(PTH). These symptoms and laboratory results are indicative of renal osteodystrophy, a metabolic bone disorder associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Renal osteodystrophy is a complex condition that results from the kidneys' inability to maintain
the proper levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood, leading to secondary
hyperparathyroidism. In CKD, the kidneys are not able to convert vitamin D to its active form,
calcitriol, which is necessary for calcium absorption in the intestines. The reduced levels of
calcitriol lead to decreased calcium absorption, resulting in hypocalcemia. The body responds to     hypocalcemia by increasing PTH secretion from the parathyroid glands in an attempt to normalize serum calcium levels.
The elevated PTH, known as secondary hyperparathyroidism, causes increased bone resorption to release calcium and phosphate into the bloodstream, leading to bone pain and fragility, and



contributing to the formation of kidney stones due to the elevated phosphate and calcium levels in the urine. Additionally, the ongoing calcium and phosphate imbalance can cause vascular
calcifications and other systemic complications leading to hypertensive crises, contributing to the patient's altered mentation and other symptoms.
Therefore, the constellation of symptoms and laboratory findings in this patient points to renal osteodystrophy, a metabolic bone disorder secondary to chronic kidney disease, rather than
primary hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, or pheochromocytoma.
other options:
option B: primary hyperparathyroidism would typically present with hypercalcemia due to
autonomous overproduction of parathyroid hormone. In this case, the patient has decreased
serum calcium, which is more indicative of secondary hyperparathyroidism due to chronic kidney disease.
option C: Hypothyroidism generally presents with symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, cold    intolerance, and dry skin. It does not typically cause elevated parathyroid hormone levels or the  specific constellation of symptoms seen in this patient (recurrent kidney stones, abdominal pain, and altered mentation).
option D: pheochromocytoma is a tumor of the adrenal gland that secretes excessive
catecholamines, leading to symptoms such as hypertension, palpitations, and episodic headaches. It does not cause hypocalcemia or elevated parathyroid hormone levels, and it is not associated
with kidney stones or the other symptoms described in this patient.",,A,
Q7,Interpret the ABG findings,"a)Respiratory acidosis
b)Respiratory alkalosis
c)Metabolic acidosis
d)Metabolic alkalosis","The ABG values indicate a metabolic alkalosis because of the significantly elevated bicarbonate level (HCo3- 44 mEq/L, normal 22-28mEq/L) and a secondary respiratory compensation
(increased pCo2 to 5o mmHg, normal 35-45 mmHg). The elevated pH (7.51, normal 7.35-7.45) confirms the alkaline state.
The compensation is not complete, as the pH remains above normal, indicating a partially compensated metabolic alkalosis.",,D,
Q8,A patient presents with complaints of chest pain for 1 hour and perspiration. He also appears anxious. ECG image is given below. what is the possible diagnosis?,"a)NSTEMI
b)unstable angina
c)posterior wall MI
d)Acute Myocarditis","The patient's presentation of chest pain for 1 hour, perspiration, and anxiety, combined with ECG findings showing ST depressions in leads v2 and v3, suggests a possible diagnosis of posterior
wall MI. posterior wall MI can present with ST depressions in the anterior leads (v1-v3) due to the reciprocal changes associated with ischemia in the posterior wall of the heart. These
depressions indicate that the infarction is not directly visible in the standard ECG leads but is affecting the posterior part of the heart.
posterior wall MI is typically caused by occlusion of the circumflex artery or the posterior
descending artery, which supplies the posterior aspect of the heart. Management of posterior wall MI involves immediate medical intervention, including the administration of antiplatelet agents,   anticoagulants, nitrates, beta-blockers, and, in many cases, reperfusion therapy through



percutaneous coronary intervention (PcI) or thrombolysis to restore blood flow to the affected area of the heart.
other options:
option A and B: NSTEMI (Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction) could present with    ST depression, but it typically affects a wider range of leads and is less likely to present with such a specific pattern of depression isolated to V2 and V3. unstable angina, characterized by chest
pain at rest or with minimal exertion, can cause ST depression, but it usually does not present  with the level of severity and specific pattern seen in this case, particularly without elevation in cardiac biomarkers.
option D: Acute myocarditis, while it can present with chest pain and EcG changes, usually shows diffuse changes, not isolated to specific leads like V2 and V3. It typically involves diffuse ST
elevation or PR depression across multiple leads. Therefore, the combination of acute symptoms and specific EcG changes in leads V2 and V3 strongly suggests that a posterior wall MI is the
most likely diagnosis for this patient.",4534-2845.PNG,C,
Q9,which of the following is the least common cause of bipedal edema?,"a)chronic venous insufficiency
b)Lupus nephritis
c)chronic liver disease
d)Heart failure","chronic venous insufficiency is the least common cause of bipedal edema. This is because, the
other conditions listed cause edema that can affect both limbs at the same time due to decreased albumin concentration or fluid retention. However, venous insufficiency is not as commonly
associated with bilateral lower limbs and is more likely to present as unilateral lower extremity edema.
Lower extremity edema is the accumulation of fluid in the tissues of the legs, leading to swelling. It can result from various conditions affecting the circulatory, lymphatic, or renal systems.
common causes include:
• Venous Insufficiency: chronic venous insufficiency (cVI) occurs when veins in the legs do not efficiently return blood to the heart, leading to pooling of blood and fluid leakage into
surrounding tissues. However, this edema is usually unilateral depending on the limb that is worse effected.
• Heart Failure: when the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, it can cause fluid buildup in the legs.
• kidney Disease: Impaired kidney function can lead to fluid retention and swelling in the lower extremities.
• Liver Disease: conditions like cirrhosis can cause decreased production of proteins like albumin, leading to fluid leakage into tissues.
• Lymphedema: Blockage or damage to the lymphatic system can prevent proper drainage of lymphatic fluid, causing swelling.
• Medications: certain drugs, such as calcium channel blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids, can cause fluid retention.
• Infections: conditions like cellulitis can cause localized swelling and inflammation.
• Pregnancy: Increased pressure on the veins and hormonal changes can lead to edema.



• prolonged Standing or Sitting: Lack of movement can cause fluid to accumulate in the legs due to gravity.
Treatment: The treatment of lower extremity edema focuses on addressing the underlying cause     and alleviating symptoms. This can include lifestyle modifications such as elevating the legs above heart level to reduce swelling, wearing compression stockings to improve venous return and
reduce fluid accumulation, and regular exercise to promote circulation.
In systemic conditions, the underlying cause should be treated to improve the edema.",,A,
Q10,A patient presents with sudden onset lower motor neuron facial paralysis on his left side. Radiological tests showed no deficits. what is the next best step in the management?,"a)Intravenous antibiotics, and mastoidectomy
b)Acyclovir, eye patching and eye ointment
c)Electrical stimulation of facial nerve
d)Facial nerve decompression","The given clinical features are suggestive of paralysis of the facial nerve also known as Bell's palsy. Treatment for this condition is with acyclovir, eye patching and eye ointments to prevent
desiccation.
Bell's palsy is an acute onset idiopathic, peripheral facial paralysis. while in most cases the cause is unknown, there can be exposure to the herpes virus in some patients. It is a lower motor
neuron lesion of the facial nerve and involves the ipsilateral side of the upper and lower halves of the face.
It presents with an inability to close the eye, and if the patient attempts to close the eye, it turns     up and out. This is known as the Bell's phenomenon. other features include drooling of saliva and facial asymmetry. There may be noise intolerance and a loss of taste sensation.
Bell's palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion. All other possible causes of facial paralysis should be ruled out by investigations.
Treatment of Bell's palsy involves prednisone 6o-8o mg daily during the first 5 days and then
tapered over the next 5 days. Acyclovir can also be used in patients who are suspected to have
exposure to the herpes virus. Tape or eye masks to depress the upper eyelid during sleep and
artificial tears can be used to prevent corneal drying. Most patients recover within a few weeks or months.",,B,
Q11,"A 5oyear old diabetic male presents with complaints of breathlessness on lying down and
walking uphill. His EcHO shows ejection fraction of 4o%. Fasting blood glucose is 135mg/dl, Bp -164/93 mmHg, HbA1c is 7.8%, Hb- 13mg/dl. which of the following anti-diabetic drugs    can be used for this patient?","a)Dapagliflozin
b)Liraglutide
c)Glimepiride
d)pramlintide","This patient has elevated fasting glucose values indicating a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. He also has reduced ejection fraction, elevated blood pressure with signs of orthopnea(breathlessness on    lying down) indicating heart failure. Dapagliflozin, which is a sodium-glucose transporter-2
(SGLT-2) inhibitor used for diabetes has been recently approved for use in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and is the preferred drug in this patient as it can help
manage both his conditions.
Dapagliflozin works by inhibiting the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) in the proximal renal tubules resulting in reduced reabsorption and increased urinary excretion of glucose. The  glucose-lowering effect is independent of insulin. Dapagliflozin acts as a diuretic and natriuretic by reducing sodium and volume load, causing intravascular contraction. Dapagliflozin is also
associated with weight loss, with reductions in blood pressure without increasing heart rate.
Dapagliflozin has been found to decrease the risk of mortality from cardiovascular causes in



diabetic patients. SGLT-2 inhibitors have a cardioprotective effect resulting from improved
cardiac cell metabolism, improvement of ventricular loading mechanism, reduction of cardiac cell necrosis and fibrosis. It also has a renoprotective property.
Side effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors include dehydration, hyperkalemia, worsening of diabetic
ketoacidosis, increased risk of fractures, leg and foot amputation with canagliflozin, and a possible increased risk of bladder cancer with dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin has also been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
other options :
option B: Liraglutide is a GLp 1 receptor agonist used for the management of diabetes mellitus. It has recently been approved for use in obesity. However, it has no role in managing heart failure.
option C: Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea that is used in patients who are not sufficiently controlled with metformin for diabetes mellitus. However, it has no role in managing heart failure.
option D: pramlintide is a subcutaneous amylin analogue used in the management of diabetes mellitus. It has no role in the management of heart failure.",,A,
Q12,which of the following are features of korsakoff's psychosis?,"a)a,b,c,d
b)a,b,c
c)a,c,d
d)a,b,d","Amnesia, polyneuropathy and confabulation are seen in korsakoff's psychosis. ophthalmoplegia is seen in wernicke's disease. peripheral neuropathy is a consequence of B1 deficiency which is   the vitamin deficit in korsakoff psychosis.
korsakoff’s psychosis is a chronic amnestic syndrome that can follow wernicke's encephalopathy due to thiamine deficiency (secondary to alcoholism). The cardinal features are impaired mental  syndrome and anterograde amnesia. only 2o% of patients recover with treatment (whereas in
wernicke's encephalopathy, there is complete reversal with treatment).
Clinical features:
• Impaired mental syndrome - especially recent memory
• Striking inability to form new memories - severe anterograde amnesia
• Retrograde amnesia is less severe.
• present with confabulation as an attempt to cover the memory deficit
• There is a lack of insight and no intellectual functional loss.
• overall intact intelligence
• Implicit learning (e.g., learning procedures) is preserved.
• Long-term and immediate memory is normal.
Treatment: Thiamine is given 1oomg orally two to three times daily for 3 to 12 months.",,D,
Q13,which of the following is an indication to start corticosteroids in a patient with IgA vasculitis?,"a)Gastrointestinal bleeds
b)Arthritis
c)Mild pain abdomen
d)severe skin rash","The presence of gastrointestinal bleeds is an indication for corticosteroid therapy in IgA vasculitis/Henoch Schonlein Purpura.
corticosteroids have improved outcomes in patients who develop severe GI complications
including GI bleeds and intractable abdominal pain in patients with HSP. This is because it can reduce the intensity of disease and improve outcomes by helping resolve the inflammation. The other indication for the use of corticosteroids is when the patient develops crescentic
glomerulonephritis, ie rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. while corticosteroids can be used for arthritis and abdominal pain, there is limited evidence of their efficacy. Thus it is strictly
reserved for severe GI and renal involvement.
Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), also known as IgA vasculitis, is a common small vessel
vasculitis. It is a type III hypersensitivity reaction characterized by the deposition of IgA in the
small vessels of the skin, joints, gastrointestinal tract, and kidney resulting in vasculitis. The exact etiology of HSP remains unknown. But, it usually occurs following an upper respiratory tract
infection caused by group A Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma, and Adenovirus. Patients usually present with the following features:
• Palpable purpura is symmetric and occurs in the lower extremities, extensor aspect of the upper limbs, and buttocks.
• Arthralgia and arthritis- commonly affecting hip, knee, or ankle joints.
• Gastrointestinal manifestations like abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, intestinal perforation and intussusception.
• About 3o% of the patients with HSP develop renal manifestations, presenting as microscopic hematuria, hypertension, and progressive glomerulonephritis.
Nephritis due to IgA vasculitis should be treated with immunosuppressants like prednisolone and azathioprine.
The image given below shows palpable purpura in the lower limbs seen in HSP.",,A,4556-2851.PNG
Q14,A 35-year-old female patient presents with dyspnea and palpitations. ECG is given below. which of the following is false about her condition?,"a)Is a rare finding in a morphologically normal heart
b)Treated with intravenous digoxin to control ventricular rate
c)should be treated with cardioversion in all cases
d)Difference in pR and HR can be used to diagnose","In this patient presenting with palpitations, and irregular RR intervals with absent P waves on  ECG, the most likely diagnosis is atrial fibrillation. The false statement is that atrial fibrillation should be treated with cardioversion in all cases.
Cardioversion, whether electrical or pharmacological, is not always appropriate for every patient    with AF. The decision to perform cardioversion depends on several factors, including the duration of the AF episode, the presence of underlying heart disease, the patient's symptoms, and the risk    of thromboembolism. In some cases, rate control and anticoagulation may be the preferred
treatment approach rather than attempting to restore sinus rhythm immediately. Therefore, while cardioversion is a treatment option for some patients with AF, it is not universally indicated for all cases.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a supraventricular tachycardia caused by ectopic foci or small reentry circuits within the atria. It has an atrial rate of 4oo-6oo/min and a ventricular rate of
1oo-16o/min.
Risk factors for developing AF include:
• Age- usually above 6o years of age
• underlying heart disease
• Hypertension
• Diabetes mellitus
• obesity
• sleep apnea
• Post-cardiac surgery
• Inflammatory pericarditis
• Acute alcohol consumption
Features include heart rate typically ranges from 11o-16o beats/minute. It is irregular and rapid.   Presyncope and syncope can be seen. Thrombus formation can occur and thromboembolic events can take place.
Typically, ECG shows an absent P wave and irregular RR intervals.
Management is mainly by control of rate and rhythm, avoiding the thromboembolism risk and modifiable risk factors.
other options:
option A: Atrial fibrillation is usually seen in a patient with underlying heart disease and is a rare occurrence in morphologically normal hearts.
option B: Intravenous digoxin can be used to control the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation,
especially in patients with heart failure or those who are not suitable for beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers. However, digoxin is not always the first-line treatment for rate control.
option D: The difference between the pulse rate (PR) and the heart rate (HR) can indeed be used to diagnose atrial fibrillation. This discrepancy, known as a pulse deficit, occurs because not all    heartbeats result in a palpable pulse due to the irregular and often rapid ventricular response.",4536-2846.PNG,C,
Q15,A patient presents with cough and hemoptysis and is diagnosed with pulmonary aspergillosis. He was treated with voriconazole. which of the following is false about voriconazole?,"a)It should be taken on an empty stomach
b)Therapeutic drug monitoring is required
c)It can be combined with pyrazinamide
d)A loading dose should be given","voriconazole should not be combined with pyrazinamide. This is because, both these drugs are hepatotoxic and can cause fulminant liver failure if combined together. Thus, this is false with   regards to voriconazole.
voriconazole is an azole antifungal used in the management of pulmonary aspergillosis. It is also the drug of choice for invasive aspergillosis, disseminated infections caused by
fluconazole-resistant Candida, Fusarium infections, and febrile neutropenia not responding to antibacterial therapy.
patients who are started on voriconazole should initially receive a loading dose of 6mg/kg body
weight for 24 hours followed by 3-4mg/kg body weight for 12 hours.  After this, patients can be
shifted to oral administration of the drug. voriconazole is metabolized by the cytochrome p45o
group of enzymes and thus its blood levels should be monitored. This is especially indicated in
patients with liver disease to adequately titrate the drug dosage.(option B). patients are advised to take the drug on an empty stomach as fatty meals reduce the absorption of the drug(option A)
other adverse effects of voriconazole include rashes, photosensitivity, transient visual or auditory  hallucinations and anaphylactoid reactions. Intravenous voriconazole should be used with caution in patients with renal failure.",,C,
Q16,A patient with a history of sore throat was treated with antibiotics. He now presents with facial swelling. urine examination shows eosinophilia and wBC casts. what is the likely   diagnosis?,"a)Acute interstitial nephritis
b)Lupus nephritis
c)pyelonephritis
d)post streptococcal glomerulonephritis","In this patient with a history of antibiotic use, after a sore throat presenting with facial swelling and WBC casts in the urine, the likely diagnosis is acute interstitial nephritis(AIN) likely
secondary to penicillin use.
AIN usually occurs as an allergic response to certain medications. offending agents include  beta-lactam antibiotics like methicillin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump
inhibitors, sulfonamide derivatives, diuretics, antiepileptics (phenytoin, valproate), and sulfasalazine.
Individuals with AIN are usually asymptomatic and are incidentally found to have elevated
creatinine. However, in some instances, they can develop fever and rash. In severe cases, renal failure with proteinuria can occur.
Laboratory studies may show peripheral eosinophilia and urinary eosinophilia. However, these are not specific or sensitive enough to serve as diagnostic criteria.
Treatment depends on how severe AIN is. Milder cases can be treated by stopping the offending drug. More severe cases require hospitalization and follow-up.",,A,
Q17,which of the following is a worrisome feature in a patient presenting with headache?,"a)1,2,3
b)1,2,3,4
c)1,2,4
d)3,4","statements 1,2,3 are indications for further evaluation of a headache



In a patient presenting with a headache, the following features are worrisome:
• Tenderness over the temporal area: This is a worrisome feature because it may indicate temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis), a condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent  complications such as vision loss.
• subacute onset, worsening over 2 weeks: This is concerning as it suggests a progressive
underlying condition, which could be indicative of serious issues such as a tumor, an expanding  subdural hematoma, infection, or other intracranial processes that require further investigation.
• Age of 5o years: Age is a significant factor because the incidence of secondary headaches due to serious underlying causes increases with age. Conditions such as temporal arteritis and
intracranial neoplasms are more common in older adults.
In contrast, a history of cocaine abuse is not specifically a worrisome feature in the context of the  headache itself. while cocaine abuse can lead to headaches due to its vasoconstrictive properties   and potential to cause hypertensive emergencies or strokes, it is not a primary red flag feature for serious underlying causes of headaches in the same way as the other listed factors. However, a
history of cocaine abuse does warrant attention for other potential health risks and complications associated with drug use.",,A,
Q18,which of the following conditions is cannabinoid oil not indicated in?,"a)Lennoux gustaut
b)Dravet syndrome
c)Tuberous sclerosis
d)Rett syndrome","Cannabinoid oil is not indicated in Rett syndrome.
The FDA recently approved cannabidiol oral solution for the treatment of seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex in patients one year of age and older. It was previously approved for     the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome.
Cannabinoid oil is an oral derivative of the cannabis plant. The mechanism by which it improves seizure threshold is not understood yet and there are various studies ongoing to survey its use.    The cannabinoid receptors are G protein-coupled receptors located predominantly in the
presynaptic nerve terminals.
The CB1 receptor is located in the central nervous system. Activation of CB1 receptor results in euphoria and alleviation of pain (anti-nociceptive effect). The CB2 receptor is located mainly in the periphery and their activation does not have a euphoric effect.
The endogenous cannabinoid system is a potential target for use in the treatment of chronic pain. The most common adverse effects of CBD at doses used for treating epilepsy include somnolence, fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and elevated hepatic transaminases. The elevations in liver   transaminases are dose-related.",,D,
Q19,"ABG findings of a person presenting with abdominal pain and vomiting are as follows. pH

b)Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis
c)High anion gap metabolic acidosis
d)Normal anion gap respiratory acidosis","The ABG findings of a person presenting with abdominal pain and vomiting, showing a pH of

secondary to a diabetic ketoacidosis state.



Anion Gap=Na+ - (cl- + HcO3-), so Anion Gap=135-(92+2o)=135-112=23
The low pH and low bicarbonate confirm acidemia with a metabolic component. The significantly elevated blood glucose level, along with symptoms of abdominal pain and vomiting, strongly
suggests diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as the underlying cause.",,C,
Q20,"A farmer presents with high grade fever, rash, vomiting, retro orbital pain and myalgia since 5 days is suspected to have dengue hemorrhagic fever. which of the following investigations  can be done for the diagnosis?","a)RTPCR for viral detection

d)viral isolation of Aedes albopictus ■(C6/36) culture","The given clinical scenario is of a farmer with suspected dengue hemorrhagic fever. As he has   presented 5 days after the onset of symptoms, the most appropriate test for him would be IgM ELISA. NS1 antigen is the preferred test had he presented before 5 days.
Dengue is an acute febrile illness caused by the dengue virus that is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito.
It presents as sudden-onset fever, retroorbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, and a rash. The initial
rash in dengue may appear as flushing erythema of the face in the first 2 days of symptoms. A
second rash occurs 3-6 days after the onset of fever and appears maculopapular or morbilliform. Sometimes, lesions may coalesce and appear as 'white islands in a red sea' due to generalized
erythema with petechiae and islands of sparing.
Before day 5 of illness, during the febrile period, dengue infections may be diagnosed by detection of viral antigens like non-structural viral protein antigen(NS 1) by ELISA or rapid tests. This is
considered the mainstay of diagnosis.
virus isolation in cell culture and viral RNA detection by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) can also be done.
Serological tests, such as IgM ELISA, are performed after day 5 when dengue viruses and antigens are no longer present in the blood due to the appearance of specific antibodies.",,C,

b)IgG antigliadin positive
c)Modified Marsh classification
d)HLA DQ6 and HLA DQ11","HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 are associated with celiac disease, not HLA DQ6 and HLA DQ11.
celiac disease or celiac sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy is triggered by the ingestion of
gluten-containing foods such as barley, rye, oats, and wheat (mnemonic: BROW) in genetically predisposed individuals. It usually affects the 2nd part of the duodenum or proximal jejunum.
Diagnosis:



• Tissue Transglutaminase Ab (tTG-IgA) - single best screening test (option A)
• IgG Anti-gliadin antibodies (option B) are produced in response to gliadin, a component found  in wheat. These are associated with celiac disease along with other antibodies like IgA Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies and Anti-endomysial antibodies.
• HLA-DQ2 or DQ8- HLA testing is useful for ruling out celiac disease.
• Endoscopy with small bowel biopsy is used as a confirmatory test to diagnose celiac disease and not as an initial test in suspected cases.
• The histopathology is characterized by villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and increased
intraepithelial CD8+T lymphocytes. An increase in the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes is a sensitive marker of celiac disease, even in the absence of epithelial damage and villous atrophy.
• Modified MARsH's score (option C) is used to assess celiac disease histologically.",,D,4561-2852.PNG

the following is incorrect regarding hypertensive management in this case?","a)In hemorrhagic stroke, reduce the BP to less than 16o/1oo mmHg with antihypertensives to prevent rebleed
b)In hemorrhagic stroke, aggressive use of Iv antihypertensive if SBP &gt; 22o
c)In ER multiple blood pressure readings should be taken before starting anti-hypertensive therapy
d)In ischemic stroke, BP should be reduced to &lt;14o/9o mmHg immediately","option D is incorrect regarding hypertensive management in this case.  In ischemic stroke, BP should be reduced to &lt;185/11o mmHg immediately before doing thrombolysis.
In ischemic stroke, blood pressure is generally not aggressively lowered immediately unless it is     extremely high (usually &gt;22o/12o mmHg), because maintaining higher blood pressure can help ensure adequate perfusion of the brain tissue and reduce the risk of worsening ischemia. Before     performing thrombolysis in ischemic stroke, BP must be reduced to &lt;185/11omm Hg
immediately, and not less than &lt;14o/9o mmHg.  If the BP is reduced to &lt;14o/9o mmHg, it would further compromise the cerebral perfusion and can increase the infarct size. The goal is   typically to avoid lowering BP too quickly, and a more gradual reduction is preferred.
other options
option A: In hemorrhagic stroke, BP should be reduced to less than 16o/1oo mmHg with antihypertensives to prevent rebleed.



option B: In the case of hemorrhagic stroke, if the systolic blood pressure (SBP) is greater than   22o mmHg, aggressive lowering of blood pressure with IV antihypertensives is recommended to reduce the risk of further bleeding.
option C: In the emergency room, multiple blood pressure readings should be taken to accurately assess the patient's blood pressure before initiating any antihypertensive therapy, especially in a    setting like hypertensive emergencies.",,D,
Q26,which of the following is not a feature of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura?,"a)Thrombocytopenia
b)Thrombosis
c)Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia

Renal injury can occur in TTP due to microvascular injury, but it is not a defining feature of TTP, whereas the other three features (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, microangiopathic hemolytic
anaemia) are key components of the disease.
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare hematological disorder primarily characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia, neurological
symptoms, and sometimes fever. It is typically associated with the following:
• Thrombocytopenia
• Thrombosis
• Microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia
other options
option A: Thrombocytopenia is a hallmark feature ofTTP. Platelets are consumed in the formation of microthrombi, leading to a low platelet count.
option B: Thrombosis: TTP involves the formation of microthrombi (not large thrombosis) in
small vessels, particularly in organs like the kidneys, brain, and heart. These microthrombi lead to other characteristic features, including hemolysis and thrombocytopenia.
option C: Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is another key feature ofTTP. The microthrombi
damage red blood cells as they pass through small blood vessels, resulting in hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells).",,D,

b)presence of diarrhea
c)Enthesitis
d)Nail pitting","The presence of diarrhea is not a characteristic symptom of psoriatic arthritis, therefore, it cannot help in differentiating the condition from other forms of arthritis.
Psoriatic arthritis can sometimes be associated with inflammatory bowel disease causing diarrhea. However, diarrhea is not specific to psoriatic arthritis and can occur in other types of arthritis
such as reactive arthritis and certain types of infectious arthritis.
Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory type of arthritis mainly affecting the distal interphalangeal joints. In most cases, psoriasis precedes arthritis. other features include nail changes (pitting,
horizontal ridging, onycholysis, yellowish discoloration, hyperkeratosis), dactylitis, enthesitis, and



tenosynovitis. The Classification of Psoriatic Arthritis (CAsPAR) criteria are a useful tool for early diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis.
other options:
option A: Dactylitis is a characteristic feature of psoriatic arthritis, referring to the inflammation of an entire finger or toe. It is not commonly seen in other types of arthritis.
option C: Enthesitis (inflammation of the entheses) is a hallmark of psoriatic arthritis and is less common in other forms of arthritis like rheumatoid arthritis.

Q28,what is the mutation seen in sickle cell anemia?,"a)Glu---&gt; val(6)
b)Lys---&gt; Arg
c)Glu--&gt; lysine
d)Ala--&gt; Gly (9)","Glu---&gt; val(6) mutation is seen in sickle cell anemia.
sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder that occurs due to a missense mutation (a type of point mutation) in the β-globin gene of Hbs, which results in the replacement of polar   glutamate residue with non-polar valine at the 6th position, generating a hydrophobic “sticky     patch” on the surface of the β subunit of deoxygenated Hbs.


Both HbA and Hbs contain a complementary sticky patch on their surfaces that is exposed only in the deoxygenated state. Thus, at low Po2, deoxyHbs polymerizes to form long, twisted helical
fibers. This distorts the biconcave RBC into a sickle shape. The precipitated Hbs also damages the RBC membrane, so the cells become highly fragile and get easily hemolyzed leading to anemia.





The major pathophysiology involves chronic hemolysis and microvascular occlusion. Hypoxia
increases the concentration of deoxygenated HbS promoting RBC sickling. These sickle cells can disrupt circulation causing vascular occlusion and tissue infarction. vaso-occlusive crises, also
known as pain crises, are a result of this hypoxic injury and infarction. These crises predominantly affect the bones, lungs, liver, brain, spleen, and penis.",,A,4564-2853.PNG;4565-2854.PNG

b)starts in infancy
c)Hypoparathyroidism
d)High association with candidiasis","Diabetes mellitus type 1 usually occurs in APS-2 and is less commonly associated with APS-1.
This clinical scenario is suggestive of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy (APS) type 1. It is also called APECED (autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, candidiasis, and ectodermal dystrophy).
It is caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene. This gene usually increases     the tolerance of central T-cells to peripheral tissue antigens. when this function is lost, the T-cells become more prone to mount immune reactions against tissue antigens, promoting
autoimmunity. These patients develop autoantibodies against IL-17 and IL-22, which are crucial    for defence against fungal infections. APS type 1 usually presents in childhood. It can also start in infancy (option B) and the presentation can evolve over time.
APS type 1 presents in childhood with the following features:
• Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (option D)
• Ectodermal dystrophy (abnormalities of the skin, dental enamel, and nails)
• organ-specific autoimmune disorders such as -
• Autoimmune adrenalitis
• Autoimmune hypoparathyroidism (option C)

In hemolytic anaemia, the following features are typically observed:



• Indirect van den Bergh test is positive (statement 1). This indicates an increase in unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin, which is a hallmark of hemolysis.
• urobilinogen is high (statement 4). Increased breakdown of haemoglobin leads to more bilirubin being converted to urobilinogen in the intestines, which is then absorbed and excreted in urine.
van den Bergh test can be used to determine the serum bilirubin level in a patient with jaundice.  van den Bergh's reaction is a colourimetric method to measure serum bilirubin. It is based on the formation of red-purple azodipyrroles when diazotised sulfanilic acid reacts with bilirubin.

b)Anti-centromere pattern: systemic sclerosis
c)Nucleolar pattern: sLE
d)Homogenous pattern: sLE","Clinical and immunofluorescence patterns are suggestive of a diagnosis of systemic sclerosis and Anti-centromere pattern in ANA.
The given clinical scenario featuring the recurrent bluing of hands(Raynaud phenomenon),
difficulty swallowing (GERD), and tightening of the skin in the hands is suggestive of CREsT
syndrome/ limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, and anti-centromere antibodies are most specific for this disease.
CREsT syndrome consists of the following:
• Calcinosis cutis
• Raynaud’s phenomenon
• Esophageal dysmotility
• sclerodactyly
• Telangiectasia
systemic sclerosis (ssc) is a chronic autoimmune disease. Progressive fibrosis due to the
deposition of extracellular matrix components in different tissues and organs is the prominent feature of ssc.
The characteristic features of ssc are vascular damage, inflammation, and the presence of specific autoantibodies.
ssc is classified into two based on the extent of skin involvement.
• Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis / CREsT syndrome
• Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis
In limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcssc), fibrosis in the skin of acral parts of the body, like the face and limbs (distal to elbow and knee), takes place. skin fibrosis in limited type has a slow progression, but microcirculation disturbances like Raynaud's phenomenon start long before the skin symptoms and are associated with the involvement of the lungs and esophagus.
since it has late and slow organ involvement, it is associated with a good prognosis with a 1o-year survival of over 9o%.
Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are present in 9o - 95% of cases with ssc.
Autoantibodies specific to limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis include:
• Anti-centromere
• Anti-Th/To
• Anti-U1-RNP

Rhomberg test is positive with broad-based gait and loss of proprioception of both lower
limbs. He also has a history of low BP, hypothyroidism, and gastrectomy for gastric cancer a year back. which of the following deficiencies can cause the current condition?","a)vitamin B12 deficiency
b)Folic acid deficiency
c)Thiamine deficiency
d)Transferrin deficiency","The given clinical presentations of numbness in the lower limbs, positive Romberg test,
broad-based gait, and loss of proprioception are suggestive of dorsal column involvement of the spinal cord due to underlying vitamin B12 deficiency.
vitamin B12 deficiency causes subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (SACD). It affects the following structures:
• Dorsal column - sensory loss, paresthesias, incontinence, sensory ataxia (positive Romberg sign with eyes closed)
• Lateral column - spasticity and paraplegias in later stages
The history of low BP, hypothyroidism, and recent gastrectomy further supports the diagnosis. Gastrectomy can lead to vitamin B12 malabsorption because the intrinsic factor(required for     vitamin B12 absorption) is reduced after stomach removal leading to vitamin B12 deficiency.
Hypothyroidism can sometimes coexist with B12 deficiency.
Folate deficiency (option B) is typically not associated with neurological manifestations. In
patients with a combined deficiency of B12 and folate, B12 deficiency must always be corrected first. This is because the administration of folate supplements may improve hematologic



abnormalities but worsen neurological manifestations.
Treatment of cobalamin deficiency is as follows:
• Replenishment of body stores: Six 1ooo-μg IM injections of hydroxocobalamin given at 3- to 7-day intervals.
• Maintenance therapy: 1ooo μg hydroxocobalamin IM once every 3 months Treatment of folate deficiency is as follows:
• 5–15 mg oral folic acid daily for a minimum of 4 months.

c)1, 2, 3
d)1, 2, 4","Brown-coloured urine is seen in glomerular hematuria, dysuria is absent and rare edema is present.
Glomerular hematuria is the presence of red blood cells (RBCs) in the urine that originate from the glomeruli. It can be identified by :
• Dysmorphic RBCs: (&gt;4o%)
RBCs that are misshapen or fragmented, often due to mechanical damage while passing through the damaged glomerular filtration barrier. These deformed RBCs are a hallmark of glomerular     hematuria.
• Acanthocytes: (&gt;5%)
These are abnormally shaped RBCs with a spiky or irregular surface, which suggest that the RBCs have been damaged as they pass through the glomerulus.
• RBC Casts: (&gt;1)
The presence of RBC casts in the urine indicates that the blood is originating from the glomeruli, as casts are formed in the renal tubules.
These findings are indicative of glomerular injury, distinguishing glomerular hematuria from non-glomerular hematuria, where RBCs are typically normal and do not exhibit these
characteristics.
Hemoglobin from red blood cells that have passed through the damaged glomerular basement
membrane gets oxidized to methemoglobin, giving urine a dark or ""cola-brown"" appearance. This is a hallmark feature of glomerular hematuria. (A)
Dysuria (painful urination) is typically not a feature of glomerular hematuria, as this symptom is more common in lower urinary tract infections or bladder pathologies. (B)
Crystals in urine suggest kidney stones or metabolic disorders, not glomerular hematuria. (C)
Edema is a feature in nephritic syndrome or glomerulonephritis, which are associated with
glomerular hematuria, due to sodium retention or hypoalbuminemia. Therefore, edema can be present in conditions causing glomerular hematuria. (D)",,D,

d)Brugada's syndrome","The ECG provided shows epsilon waves and T wave inversions, which is a hallmark finding suggestive ofArrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD).
The clinical presentation of young females with palpitations and syncope, especially post-exercise, are common in ARVD due to ventricular arrhythmias.
The changes marked in ECG show a notched deflection at the end of the QRS complex due to  delayed ventricular activation known as an epsilon wave. It is commonly seen in patients with ARVD.
ARVD is autosomal dominant cardiomyopathy characterized by fibrofatty replacement in the
myocardium of the ventricles. It most commonly affects the right ventricle. It is due to mutations
in the gene encoding desmosome-associated protein plakophilin 2. This leads to defective cell-adhesion proteins in the desmosomes that link adjacent cardiac myocytes.
The patients usually present with rhythm disturbances, right-sided heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. ARVD is associated with Naxos syndrome. This syndrome is characterised by  arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy and hyperkeratosis of the palmar and the plantar surfaces.
Morphology shows severe thinning of the right ventricular wall due to loss of myocytes,
accompanied by extensive fatty infiltration and fibrosis. In ARVD, there is T inversion and
delayed ventricular activation manifesting as epsilon waves. This reflects the involvement of the right ventricular myocardium.





other options
option A: Uhl’s disease is rare and typically associated with the absence of RV muscle. It does not have specific ECG patterns like those in ARVD.
option C: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) usually shows LV hypertrophy with left-axis deviation and repolarization abnormalities, particularly in lateral leads.
option D: Brugada syndrome is characterized by coved-type ST elevation in leads V1-V3, not T wave inversions as seen here.",4545-2849.PNG,B,4575-2857.PNG
Q44,"A 2o-year-old male patient presented with a history of occasional palpitation, high BP, and
headache. The patient was diagnosed with pheochromocytoma. which of the following will be the preferred first investigation?","a)USG-abdomen
b)MIBG
c)MRI- abdomen
d)24-hour urine metanephrines","The preferred first investigation for a patient diagnosed with pheochromocytoma would be 24-hour urine metanephrines.
This test (24-hour urine metanephrines) is highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing
pheochromocytoma. Elevated levels of metanephrines (products of catecholamine metabolism) in the urine indicate the condition. After biochemical confirmation, other imaging studies, like MRI  or MIBG scans, are typically used to localise the tumour.
other options
option A: USG-abdomen can help detect abdominal masses, but it is not sensitive enough for pheochromocytoma, as it is not accurate in detecting it.
option B: MIBG scan is specific for detecting pheochromocytoma, but it is not typically used as a first-line investigation. It is used only after biochemical confirmation.
option C: MRI-abdomen can be useful for tumour localisation, but biochemical testing (like 24-hour urine metanephrines) is preferred first for diagnosis.",,D,
