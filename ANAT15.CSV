Q1,An absent gag reflex can result from injury to which of the following nerves?,"a) ■ and ■
b) ■ and ■
c) ■ and ■
d) ■ and ■","An absent gag reflex can result from injury to the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) and the vagus nerve (X).
The afferent nerve for the gag reflex is the glossopharyngeal nerve, while the efferent nerve consists of both the glossopharyngeal (to the stylopharyngeus muscle) and vagus. Both these nerves pass through the jugular foramen and damage to them may be the cause for loss of gag reflex.
pharyngeal branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve form the pharyngeal plexus of nerves.
The main functions of IX and X can be tested together by assessing swallowing, phonation/articulation and sensation from the pharynx/larynx.",,A,
Q2,"If a tumor compresses the structures passing through the opening marked in the given image, which of the following sensations would be affected?","a) sensation of the nasopharynx
b) Mucosa of the nasal cavity
c) sensation in the anterior scalp and dorsum of the nose
d) sensation of the chin","The marked foramen is the superior orbital fissure. If a tumour compresses the structures passing through this foramen, it would impair sensation in the anterior scalp and dorsum of the nose, as this would affect the frontal nerve and nasociliary nerve.
The superior orbital fissure is an important anatomical opening in the skull that allows several critical structures to pass through. Among these structures, the frontal nerve and nasociliary nerve are branches of the ophthalmic nerve, the first division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V1), which is responsible for sensory innervation to parts of the face.
other options:
option A: sensation of the nasopharynx is innervated by other branches of the trigeminal and glossopharyngeal nerve.
option B: while some sensation from the nasal cavity comes from the trigeminal nerve, the specific branches affected by a lesion in the superior orbital fissure are more focused on the anterior areas of the face.
option D: sensation of the chin is primarily innervated by the mandibular branch (CN V3) of the trigeminal nerve.",401-416.PNG,C,
Q3,"A chronic tobacco consumer went to the dental clinic with bleeding lesions on his tongue and was diagnosed with carcinoma of the tongue. which of the following papillae, which do not have taste buds, is least likely to be involved in such a cancer?","a) circumvallate
b) Filiform
c) Fungiform
d) Foliate","Among the different types of papillae on the tongue, the one that does not have taste buds is the filiform papillae.
Filiform papillae are minute cylindrical or conical projections that are mainly present on the dorsal part of the anterior 2/3rd of the tongue. The filiform papillae do not contain taste buds. They are covered by keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.
other papillae of the tongue are:
circumvallate papillae are 8-12 in number which are large cylindrical structures.
Fungiform papillae are large, rounded, and red and are mainly present on the lingual margins.
Foliate papillae are red, leaf-like mucosal ridges that are present bilaterally in two zones at the sides of the tongue.",,B,225-224.PNG
Q4,"which artery is used for arteriovenous shunting with the great saphenous vein for hemodialysis, and is located behind the medial malleolus and 2.5 cm in front of the tendocalcaneus?","a) Anterior tibial artery
b) posterior tibial artery
c) peroneal artery
d) circumflex fibular artery","The posterior tibial artery, located behind the medial malleolus and 2.5 cm in front of the tendocalcaneus, that is used for arteriovenous (AV) shunting with the great saphenous vein for hemodialysis.
The posterior tibial artery is situated behind the medial malleolus and approximately 2.5 cm in front of the tendocalcaneus, making it a suitable site for creating an AV fistula with the great saphenous vein. However, they are not commonly used for AV shunting in common practices.
Arteries used for AV shunting include the radial artery and the brachial artery in the upper arm.
other options:
option A: In comparison, the anterior tibial artery is located on the anterior aspect of the leg.
option C: The peroneal (fibular) artery is situated on the lateral side of the leg.
option D: The fibular circumflex artery is a small artery and is not commonly used for hemodialysis access.",,B,
Q5,what is the outer covering of the condition shown in the image?,"a) chorion
b) Amnion
c) Endoderm
d) Ectoderm","The diagnosis based on the given image is omphalocele and is covered by the amnion.
omphalocele is a midline abdominal wall defect where the bowel and other solid viscera protrude through the umbilicus. In this condition, the herniated organs are covered by both peritoneum and an amnion. The umbilical cord inserts directly into this sac, which helps in identifying the condition. The defect occurs due to the failure of the physiological hernia to return to the body cavity by the 11th week of gestation.
Note : Gastroschisis is a condition where the intestinal loops herniate through the defect in the abdominal wall. The defect usually lies on one side of the umbilicus (right side commonly). The loops of the bowel are not covered by amnion.",402-417.PNG,B,411-424.PNG
Q6,Identify the marked structure.,"a) Thoracodorsal nerve
b) Medial pectoral nerve
c) subscapular nerve
d) Long thoracic nerve","The marked structure in the image is the medial pectoral nerve.
The given image shows the medial pectoral nerve arising from the medial cord of the brachial plexus. It also shows the axillary artery traversing inferior to the median pectoral nerve and the thoracoacromial artery. The medial pectoral nerve and the thoracoacromial artery both contribute to the neurovascular supply of the pectoral muscles.
After originating from the medial cord, the medial pectoral nerve passes anterior to the axillary artery. This nerve is specifically known for its anatomical path of piercing the pectoralis minor muscle before branching out to supply both the pectoralis minor and the pectoralis major muscles.",403-418.PNG,B,412-425.PNG
Q7,A patient presents with sciatica and tenderness in the hamstring muscles. which nerve supplies the hybrid muscle that is likely to be spared in this condition?,"a) common peroneal nerve
b) Tibial nerve
c) Femoral nerve
d) obturator nerve","The adductor magnus is the hybrid muscle that is likely to be spared in this condition.
In sciatica, the sciatic nerve is typically affected, which branches into the tibial nerve and the common peroneal nerve. The adductor magnus muscle is an example of a hybrid muscle with dual innervation:
• The adductor part of the adductor magnus is innervated by the obturator nerve.
• The hamstring part of the adductor magnus is innervated by the tibial nerve.
During sciatica, the tibial nerve is often affected, which would impact the hamstring part of the adductor magnus. However, because the adductor part of the adductor magnus is innervated by the obturator nerve, it remains functional and is likely to be spared.",,D,413-426.PNG
Q8,where will you find the epithelium shown in the image?,"a) Gall bladder
b) Trachea
c) ureter
d) Duodenum","The epithelium shown in the above image can be found in the ureter.
The ureter is lined by transitional epithelium (also called urothelium), similar to the urinary bladder. This specialized epithelium allows stretching, which is crucial as the urine passes through. The presence of transitional epithelium is characteristic of structures in the urinary system, such as the ureters, bladder, and part of the urethra.
other options:
option A: Gall bladder: The gall bladder is lined by simple columnar epithelium.
option B: Trachea: The trachea is lined by pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium with goblet cells.
option D: Duodenum: The duodenum is lined by simple columnar epithelium with goblet cells.",404-419.PNG,C,414-427.PNG
Q9,"During the examination of a patient, a professor asks the patient to invert his foot and points to a prominent tendon located behind the medial malleolus. which tendon is being highlighted?","a) Tibialis anterior
b) Extensor digitorum
c) Tibialis posterior
d) Extensor hallucis longus","The tendon being highlighted here is of the tibialis posterior.
It passes behind the medial malleolus and is a key muscle responsible for foot inversion. The tendon of this muscle becomes prominent in this area during foot inversion. Dysfunction of this tendon can lead to flatfoot deformity.
other options:
option A: Tibialis anterior lies anterior to the medial malleolus.
option B: Extensor digitorum runs anteriorly to the foot.
option D: Extensor hallucis longus runs along the anterior portion of the foot.",nan,C,415-428.PNG
Q10,"An elderly woman reports difficulty in buttoning her shirt and increased clumsiness during daily activities. on examination, she is unable to make an 'o' shape by opposing her thumb and index finger. which of the following muscles is most likely involved?","a) opponens pollicis
b) palmar interossei
c) Flexor pollicis brevis
d) Abductor pollicis brevis","The difficulty in buttoning the shirt and the inability to make the ""o"" shape with fingers suggest the involvement of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle.
This is a case of anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) syndrome. The AIN is a purely motor branch of the median nerve that affects specific muscles in the forearm, the flexor pollicis longus and flexor digitorum profundus leading to difficulty in performing tasks requiring fine motor control, such as the ""ok"" sign. Among the options provided, the abductor pollicis brevis is uniquely and consistently innervated by the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve, making it susceptible to dysfunction in conditions affecting the median nerve.",,D,
