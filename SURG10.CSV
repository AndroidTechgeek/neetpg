Q1,which of the following is not a perineal approach for the condition shown in the image?,"a)Ripstein's procedure
b)Delorme's operation
c)Thiersch operation
d)Altemeier's procedure","The condition shown in the image is a rectal prolapse and Ripstein's procedure is done using the abdominal approach.
Rectal prolapse occurs when a mucosal or full-thickness layer of rectal tissue protrudes through the anal orifice. Rectal prolapse is of two types:
• partial rectal prolapse: only the mucosal layer of the rectum is prolapsed. It is seen in children.
• complete rectal prolapse:  All the layers of the rectum are prolapsed. It is seen in adults due to the weakening of the pelvic floor.
Management:
• The first episode of a partial rectal prolapse is managed by digital repositioning. on recurrence, Theirsch's wiring or sclerotherapy are considered.
• complete rectal prolapse is managed surgically, either by perineal or abdominal approaches:
1. perineal approach: often preferred in patients with high operative risk and limited life
expectancy, i.e. in the elderly. It is associated with less morbidity but has a higher recurrence rate.
• Thiersch's wiring- A steel wire/nylon tape is placed around the anal canal. Largely obsolete now due to problems with chronic perineal sepsis, anal stenosis, and obstructed defecation.
• Delorme's mucosectomy- The rectal mucosa is stripped circumferentially from the rectum over the length of the prolapse. The underlying muscle is plicated with a series of sutures. The excess rectal mucosa is excised and a mucosal anastomosis is performed.
• Altemeier's rectosigmoidectomy- The rectum is prolapsed through the anal canal and a
full-thickness resection is performed, incorporating any associated colonic prolapse. Restoration of colorectal continuity can be performed by hand-sewn/stapled anastomosis. This is the
procedure of choice in patients presenting with incarcerated and strangulated prolapse.
2. Abdominal approach: Difficult to perform, more complications but a lower recurrence rate.
• Ripstein's procedure- involves the placement of a prosthetic mesh around the mobilized rectum, with the attachment of the mesh to the presacral fascia (anterior) below the sacral promontory.
• well's procedure- involves posterior rectopexy.
• suture rectopexy",4937-3085.PNG,A,
Q2,Identify the true statement regarding split skin and full-thickness skin grafts:,"a)2,3
b)2,4
c)1,3
d)1,4","statements 2 and 3 are correct.
split skin grafts (Thiersch grafts) are partial-thickness skin grafts consisting of the epidermis and a part of the dermis. whereas, full-thickness grafts (wolfe grafts) consist of the epidermis along   with the entire dermis, with portions of the sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and hair follicles.
primary contracture of the skin graft occurs due to passive recoil of the elastin fibers of the dermis. It occurs soon after the graft has been harvested.
• since full-thickness grafts have more dermis (implying more elastin fibers), they undergo more primary contracture.



• whereas, split skin grafts have less dermis, therefore, undergo less primary contracture.
secondary contracture of the skin graft occurs due to the pull of myofibroblasts. It occurs over time, when the transplanted graft starts healing.
• Full-thickness grafts have more ability to resist the pull of myofibroblasts, hence they have less secondary contracture.
• whereas, split skin grafts yield to the pull and develop more secondary contractures. Advantages of split over full-thickness skin graft:
• Large grafts can be harvested.
• In the case of thinner split-thickness grafts, the donor site heals more rapidly and can be reused in severe cases such as burns.
• uptake is good. Meshing can be done, i.e. small splits are done in graft, allowing exudates to drain out, thus improving graft take up.
• Meshing also allows the graft to expand.
Advantages of full-thickness over split skin graft:
• It has a lesser degree of post-graft contraction
• Best cosmetic appearance as they include the highest number of skin appendage elements.

Primary contracture	secondary contracture
Elastic recoil	Pull of myofibroblasts
Less in split-skin grafts	More in split-skin grafts
More in full-thickness grafts	Less in full-thickness grafts",,A,
Q3,"A 37-year-old unmarried nulliparous woman, having regular intercourse is on oral
contraceptive pills. Her mother was diagnosed with carcinoma breast at 6o years of age and  her elder sister was diagnosed with carcinoma ovary at 4o years of age. what is the next line of management?","a)Genetic counselling and screening for BRcA
b)Routine mammography
c)stop taking oral contraceptive pills
d)prophylactic surgery","The given family history of two primary relatives with breast and ovarian cancer with one of the relatives with onset &lt;5o years is suggestive of a woman with a high risk of breast cancer. The  next line of management is genetic counselling and screening for BRCA.
Genetic counselling is the process of discussing various genetic tests such as BRCA testing and multiple gene panel testing.
Genetic counselling and testing for genetic mutations (BRCA 1, BRCA 2 and others such as TP53, PTEN) are recommended for high-risk women with:
• Breast cancer diagnosed before age 5o
• Triple-negative breast cancer
• Bilateral breast cancer
• Breast and ovarian cancer in the same individual
• Breast cancer in men



• Family history (maternal or paternal) of two or more individuals with breast and ovarian cancer
• A close male relative with breast cancer
• A close relative with early-onset (&lt;5o years) breast or ovarian cancer
• known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation in the family
other options:
option B: Routine mammography is not the initial investigation of choice, but is used for
surveillance after the genetic screening. surveillance strategies for women with a family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer include
• self-examination of breasts starting at age 18 to 2o years - Each month
• Clinical breast examination starting at age 25 years - Every 6 months
• Mammography starting at the age of 25 years or 1o years earlier to breast cancer onset in a family member - Every year
option C: oral contraceptives can be continued in this patient as they don't increase the risk of
breast cancer in a woman with a positive family history of breast cancer. It is also useful in
reducing the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancers, which are associated with BRCA mutations.
option D: Prophylactic surgery is advised after the identification of BRCA positivity in high-risk   women. It is proven to be more effective than regular surveillance by mammography and MRI. It is usually combined with a prophylactic risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy that reduces the
risk of ovarian and breast cancers.",,A,
Q4,which of the following causes maximum malnutrition?,"a)pancreatic fistula
b)Duodenal fistula
c)Distal ileal fistula
d)colonic fistula","Among the given conditions, maximum malnutrition is caused by duodenal fistulas.
Enterocutaneous fistulas are classified according to their location and volume of daily output.
• Proximal fistulas are associated with higher output, greater fluid and electrolyte loss, and greater loss of digestive capacity.
• Distal fistulas tend to have lower output, making them easier to manage and more likely to close spontaneously.
Although both gastric and duodenal fistulas are proximal fistulas, duodenal fistulas receive
an additional 1 to 2 liters of enzymes, electrolytes, and water from the pancreatic and bile ducts. Hence duodenal fistulas are at greater risk for more electrolyte imbalance than gastric fistulas.
The management of enterocutaneous fistula is based on well-established principles known as sNAP which include:
• s - sepsis elimination and skin protection
• N - A period of parenteral nutrition may well be required
• A - Anatomical assessment
• P - Definitive planned surgery",,B,
Q5,"A 5o-year-old alcoholic patient presents with a history of waxing and waning jaundice for the past 2 months. His cT examination reveals, dilatation of the common bile duct and
pancreatic duct. what is the most probable diagnosis in this patient?","a)cholangiocarcinoma
b)periampullary carcinoma
c)common bile duct stone
d)Head of pancreas carcinoma","In the given scenario, a characteristic history of waxing and waning jaundice along with a dilated common bile duct and pancreatic duct on CT scan, points to a diagnosis of periampullary
carcinoma.
periampullary carcinoma arises from the vicinity of the ampulla ofvater. patients with hereditary polyposis syndromes, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAp) and hereditary nonpolyposis  colorectal cancer (HNpCC) have a higher risk of developing it.
Clinical features:
• Jaundice: It intermittently waxes and wanes because, whenever the tumor undergoes necrosis and sloughing, obstruction to bile ducts is partially relieved.
• weight loss
• pain: It depends on the location of the tumor and may involve back pain as well due to the
involvement of retropancreatic nerves, pancreatic duct obstruction or stasis, and disruption of nerve sheath by the tumor.
• Nausea/vomiting
• pruritus
• Fever
• Gastrointestinal bleeding
In suspected periampullary disease, a three-phase CT scan should be done routinely.
Management includes resection, along with chemotherapy/ chemoradiotherapy.",,B,
Q6,which investigation is not necessary for the following condition?,"a)Timed barium study
b)Endoscopy
c)Esophageal manometry
d)24-h pH monitoring","The given barium swallow shows a bird beak appearance and is suggestive of achalasia cardia.
24-h pH monitoring is not necessary for achalasia cardia. It is used in the diagnosis of
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
Achalasia is a primary esophageal motility disorder. It is characterized by the absence of
esophageal peristalsis and impaired lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation in response to swallowing. This is due to the loss of ganglion cells in the myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus. These abnormalities cause a functional obstruction at the gastroesophageal junction.
option A: on performing a timed barium study, barium will be retained for more than five
minutes. The fluoroscopic examination will reveal a dilated esophagus that tapers to form a 'bird's beak' at the gastroesophageal junction as seen in the image above.
option B: Endoscopy is an important investigation carried out to rule out cancer of the gastric cardia.
option C: Esophageal manometry is the investigation of choice and shows:



• Incomplete LES relaxation in response to swallowing
• High resting LES pressure
• Absent esophageal peristalsis",4939-3087.PNG,D,
Q7,The following procedure is performed for the management of:,"a)Advanced gastric carcinoma
b)Gallbladder carcinoma
c)Distal cholangiocarcinoma
d)Chronic calcific pancreatitis","The given image shows the whipple procedure.
The whipple procedure is a complex surgery done for carcinomas involving the head of the pancreas and distal cholangiocarcinoma. It is done only in cases when:
• The entire duodenum has to be removed e.g. in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
• Tumor encroaches in the first part of the duodenum or the stomach
• A clear resection margin is not achieved by pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy The following structures are removed during whipple’s procedure:
• Distal stomach
• Duodenum
• Head of the pancreas
• Gallbladder
• Common bile duct (CBD)
• Regional lymphatics",4939-3086.PNG,C,4958-3091.PNG
Q8,A patient developed a loss of sensations over the root of the penis following open hernia surgery. which of the following nerves would you implicate?,"a)Iliohypogastric nerve
b)Ilioinguinal nerve
c)Genitofemoral nerve
d)Medial cutaneous nerve of thigh","Loss of sensation in the root of the penis and adjacent part of the scrotum is suggestive of an   injury to the ilioinguinal nerve. It is most commonly injured within the inguinal canal in open hernia repair due to traction or thermal injury.
other options:
option A: The iliohypogastric nerve carries the sensory supply from the suprapubic area. Injury to this nerve in the right iliac fossa rarely causes sensory disturbances, as the suprapubic area has a   rich nerve supply from other sources too. If the nerve is severed above the anterior superior iliac    spine, it can lead to the weakened posterior wall of the inguinal canal resulting in a direct inguinal hernia. The iliohypogastric nerve can also get injured following appendicectomy.
option C: Injury to the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve results in loss of sensation in the skin of the scrotum of males, and loss of sensation of the mons pubis and labia majora in
females.
Injury to the femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve causes hypoesthesia over the anterior thigh below the inguinal ligament.
option D: The medial cutaneous nerve of thigh is a sensory branch of the femoral nerve. Injury to this nerve leads to loss of sensations over the areas supplied by this nerve, which include
anterior-medial aspect of the thigh and knee.",,B,4959-3092.PNG
Q9,which of the following statements about psoas abscess are true?,"a)1 and 2 only
b)1, 3, and 4
c)1, 2, 3, and 4
d)2, 3, and 4","The correct statements regarding psoas abscess are 1, 2, 3, and 4.
psoas abscess occurs due to a collection of pus due to an infection in the iliopsoas compartment. The compartment is retroperitoneal and hence, the abscess is also called
a retroperitoneal abscess. The compartment contains iliacus and iliopsoas muscles.
psoas abscess is either primary or secondary.
• Tuberculosis of the spine leading to pott's abscess was the leading cause of psoas abscess (statement 2).



• Recently, hematogenous spread of infection from an occult primary site (gastrointestinal or
urinary tract) has become common, especially in immunocompromised patients and the elderly (statement 4).
• Due to contiguous extension of infection from neighbouring structures. Features include
• Back pain and fever.
• soft, fluctuant swelling pointing towards the groin (hip) (statement 1).
• pain on passive hip extension or active flexion of the psoas (statement 3).
CT scanning is useful in diagnosis. percutaneous CT-guided drainage and antibiotic therapy are useful in the treatment of the condition.

Q10,A patient who had grade 3 splenic trauma was managed conservatively in the ICU. which of the following signs on day 2 would indicate a need for surgery?,"a)Haemoglobin fall from 12g/dL to 1og/dL
b)Extraperitoneal bladder rupture
c)pneumoperitoneum
d)Air in gallbladder","The presence of pneumoperitoneum on imaging would warrant a laparotomy as it indicates visceral perforation which can lead to secondary peritonitis.
secondary peritonitis usually requires surgery along with antibiotics.
The spleen is one of the most commonly injured abdominal organs. The severity of the injury is graded by the Americian association for the surgery of trauma (AAsT) spleen injury scale. The    management is based on the grade of the injury. Abdominal CT with intravenous contrast is the investigation of choice.
Conservative management is recommended in most cases according to current guidelines. There must be no evidence of active blood loss. splenic angiography and embolization are also used for non-surgical management.
surgical management is recommended when there is hemodynamic instability or failure to
respond to conservative management. It can be in the form of splenic repair, partial splenectomy,  or total splenectomy. splenectomy is recommended in significant injuries to the hilum, pulverized splenic parenchyma, or any injury &gt;grade 2 with coagulopathy.
vaccination against encapsulated bacteria must be provided to prevent infection if a splenectomy is done.
other options:
option A - The initial hemoglobin level should be carefully assessed to monitor blood loss.
patients who are stabilized after crystalloid infusion can also be managed conservatively but a lower threshold for surgery must be kept. But hemoglobin fall from 12g/dL to 1og/dL is not an indication for laparotomy as the fall in hemoglobin is not marked.
option B - Extraperitoneal bladder rupture can be managed by decompression with a urinary catheter. Later a cystography can be done to confirm healing.
option D - Air in the gallbladder can be seen in acute cholecystitis if gas-forming organisms cause secondary bacterial infection (emphysematous cholecystitis). It is managed with antibiotics and      intravenous fluids. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the surgery of choice.",,C,
Q11,A 34-year-old woman was brought to the AIIMS emergency following a road traffic accident. She was hemodynamically stable and her GCS score was 3. She was intubated and sent for     non-contrast CT which was found to be normal. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)subdural hemorrhage
b)Extradural hemorrhage
c)Diffuse axonal injury
d)cerebral contusion","The clinical scenario of a patient with a poor GCs score and a normal NCCT brain scan following a road traffic accident is suggestive of diffuse axonal injury.
Diffuse axonal injury (white matter shearing) results from shearing forces, typically from a
rotational acceleration of the brain within the rigid cranium. This causes damage to
microvasculature and disruption of axons in the subcortical parasagittal white matter, cerebellum, fornix, and internal and external capsule.
Most commonly it occurs in automobile accidents. patients are usually unconscious from the moment of impact and remain the same until death.
Diffuse axonal injury is characterized by multiple focal lesions with a characteristic distribution:
• CT may be normal.



• MRI is the modality of choice for assessing suspected diffuse axonal injury, even in patients with entirely normal CT of the brain. MRI, especially sWI (susceptibility-weighted imaging)
demonstrates small regions of susceptibility artifact or hemorrhage.
other options:
option A: subdural hemorrhage is often due to the rupture of veins that cross the subdural space. In subdural hemorrhage, the CT shows concavo-convex opacity.
option B: Extradural hemorrhage is mostly due to the rupture of the middle meningeal artery. since the dura matter tends to adhere to the skull the hemorrhage is seen in CT as
a biconvex dense area. They usually do not cross cranial sutures.
option D: Cerebral contusion occurs due to traumatic brain injury, at the sites that come in direct contact with the skull. Imaging may show microhemorrhages and edema. usually, no treatment is required.",,C,
Q12,which of the following findings is likely to be seen in this patient?,"a)Decreased posterior tibial &amp; dorsalis pedis pulsations
b)Loss of sensation over foot
c)positive trendelenberg sign
d)pain on compression of calf","In the given image, the lesion present over the plantar surface of the foot is likely to be a neuropathic ulcer. Neuropathic ulcers can lead to loss of sensation over the foot.
A neuropathic ulcer is one that occurs as a result of peripheral neuropathy. In peripheral
neuropathy, lack of sensation over the pressure points leads to cumulative microtrauma, minor     wounds, or cuts that go unnoticed eventually developing into ulcers. They are painless ulcers that are punched out with regular margins. They are often located on the plantar surface of the
foot. ulcer margins show the presence of calluses.
other options:
option A: Decreased posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulsations are usually seen in peripheral arterial disease, which causes arterial ulcers that are usually found on the dorsal surface of the   foot.
option C: positive Brodie-Trendelenburg test is seen in varicose veins. This condition leads to venous ulcers which are usually seen on the medial malleolus of the foot.
option D: pain on compression of calf is a sign of deep venous thrombosis.",4939-3087-1.png,B,
Q13,"A 3o-year-old male patient presents with a pelvic fracture following blunt abdominal trauma. No blood is seen at the meatus. catheterization does not produce significant urine output.
The radiological image is given below. what is the next step in management?","a)suprapubic cystostomy
b)perurethral catheterization
c)Laparotomy
d)pelvic packing along with B/L percutaneous nephrostomy","The given clinical scenario of blunt abdominal trauma, minimal urine output on catheterization, and the pattern of contrast extravasation in the given image indicate intraperitoneal bladder
rupture. The absence of blood at the meatus rules out urethral injury. The preferred next step of management, in this case, is laparotomy.
Bladder rupture may be extraperitoneal or intraperitoneal.
• The bladder is related to the peritoneum only on its superior surface. Therefore, if the bladder rupture is towards the superior surface, the urine leaks into the peritoneal cavity, i.e. urine
extravasation will be intraperitoneal.



• whereas, bladder rupture due to injury to the anterior or lateral surfaces does not rupture the peritoneum. In such cases, the urine leaks into the perivesical space but does not enter the
peritoneum, i.e. urine extravasation will be extraperitoneal.
Intraperitoneal bladder rupture is caused by a blow or fall on the distended bladder.
Intraperitoneal bladder rupture manifests as sudden severe pain in the hypogastrium and
syncope. There will be an associated increase in BUN and creatinine due to systemic absorption of the extravasated urine and it may also lead to chemical peritonitis.


Investigations :
• CT scan can be done to diagnose bladder rupture.
• A plain erect X-ray may show a ground-glass appearance.
• Intravenous urography (IVU) may confirm a leak.
• Retrograde cystography will confirm the diagnosis.
Intraperitoneal bladder rupture leads to extravasation of the contrast material into the peritoneal cavity, around the bowel loops and paracolic gutters. Hence, an outline of bowel loops can be
seen. The image below shows intraperitoneal bladder rupture, with arrows showing contrast material in the peritoneal cavity:





Extraperitoneal bladder rupture leads to extravasation of the contrast material into the perivesical space and the fascia planes anterior to the peritoneum. The image below shows extraperitoneal
bladder rupture, with contrast material in the retro-pubic space (no contrast can be seen within the peritoneal cavity).",4942-3088.PNG,C,4963-3093.PNG;4964-3095.PNG;4964-3094.PNG;4965-3096.PNG
Q14,which of the following would be the most commonly encountered ectopic tissue in Meckel's diverticulum?,"a)Gastric and pancreatic
b)colonic and pancreatic
c)Gastric and colonic
d)Thyroid and lung","The ectopic tissue encountered in Meckel’s diverticulum includes gastric and pancreatic tissue.
Meckel’s diverticulum is caused by a failure of normal regression of the vitelline duct that develops during weeks 5 to 7 of gestation.
The most common presentation is painless, massive, lower GI bleeds in children younger than 5 years. A Meckel's can be the lead point for ileoileal or ileocolic intussusception. The bleeding
Meckel's diverticulum may be confirmed by a 99 mTc-pertechnetate isotope scan to detect gastric mucosa and pancreatic tissue.
surgical treatment is the definitive therapy for Meckel’s diverticulum. A V-shaped
diverticulectomy with transverse closure of the ileum can be done.",,A,
Q15,what is true about gall bladder carcinoma?,"a)palpable abdominal lump is the earliest sign
b)Earliest sign is jaundice
c)clinical presentation of gall stones can be distinguished from gall bladder cancer
d)Median survival is 6 months","Gallbladder carcinoma is a rare malignancy that is seen in the elderly. It is associated with a poor prognosis and median survival is less than 6 months.
Gallbladder carcinoma is indistinguishable from cholecystitis or cholelithiasis (option C). It is
usually diagnosed when patients undergo cholecystectomy for gallstones. Its clinical features
include right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Jaundice, palpable mass, and anorexia are late features (options A and B). CA 19-9 is elevated in the carcinoma gallbladder and is used for monitoring.
The preoperative diagnosis is often made on ultrasonography and followed up by a CT scan or MRI/ Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography.
A percutaneous biopsy under radiological guidance is done for pathological examination. PET scanning helps in detecting metastatic disease.



In select cases, a laparoscopic examination is useful in staging the disease. Laparoscopy can also detect peritoneal or liver metastases. The most important prognostic factor is the depth of
invasion (T-stage).",,D,
Q16,Neurogenic shock is associated with _______.,"a)Hypertension + tachycardia
b)Hypotension + tachycardia
c)Hypotension + bradycardia
d)Hypertension + bradycardia","Neurogenic shock is associated with Hypotension + Bradycardia.
Neurogenic shock refers to reduced tissue perfusion due to loss of vasomotor tone to peripheral arterial beds. It is a type of distributive shock.
Neurogenic shock is usually secondary to spinal cord injuries due to vertebral body fractures of
the cervical or high thoracic region that disrupts the sympathetic regulation of peripheral vascular tone. Loss of vasoconstrictor impulses results in increased vascular capacitance decreased venous  return and decreased cardiac output.


The classic description of neurogenic shock consists of:
• Hypotension associated with bradycardia (absence of reflexive tachycardia due to disrupted sympathetic discharge)
• warm extremities (due to loss of peripheral vasoconstriction)
• Motor and sensory deficits indicative of a spinal cord injury
• Radiographic evidence of a vertebral column fracture",,C,4966-3097.PNG
Q17,An old lady sustained a fall and developed a headache and neurological symptoms a few days later. what is your diagnosis?,"a)Multi-infarct dementia
b)Frontal lobe meningioma
c)korsakoff disease
d)Subdural hematoma","The given clinical scenario of an elderly suffering from headache and neurological symptoms following trauma is suggestive of subdural hematoma (SDH).



SDH (acute/chronic) is the accumulation of blood between the arachnoid membrane and the dural layers of the meninges. The source of the bleeding is usually from the rupture of bridging veins
running from the cerebral cortex to the dural sinuses. Elderly, alcoholics &amp; patients on     anticoagulation are at a higher risk of developing SDH, especially after head trauma including trivial incidents.
Non-contrast CT is the investigation of choice.
Radiographic features of subdural hemorrhage are:
• Typically unilateral (85%).
• Crescent-like distribution (concavo-convex) around the periphery of the brain.
• Not limited by sutures (vs extradural hemorrhage which is limited by sutures)
• Hyperdense lesion on CT: Acute SDH
• Hypodense lesion on CT: Chronic SDH
The given image shows the hyperdense collection seen in acute SDH.


open craniotomy for the evacuation of acute SDH is indicated for the following:
• Thickness &gt;1 cm
• Midline shift &gt;5 mm
• or GCS drop by two or more points from the time of injury to hospitalization. other options:
option A: Multi-infarct dementia (MID) is a type of vascular dementia occuring due to multiple small infarcts leading to brain tissue injury. It commonly causes memory loss in the elderly.
option B: Frontal lobe meningiomas are benign brain tumors that develop from the meninges. They cause personality changes that may be mistaken for depression.
option C: korsakoff syndrome is a memory disorder that results from vitamin B1 deficiency and is commonly seen in  alcoholics. These patients present with impairment in storing new memories,   disorientation, and confabulation. Consciousness is preserved.",,D,4967-3098.PNG
Q18,which of the following is not a part of damage control surgery?,"a)control of hemorrhage
b)Resuscitation
c)Decontamination
d)vascular anastomosis","vascular anastomosis is undertaken as a part of definitive surgery, not damage control
surgery (DCS).
DCS is minimal intervention done in order to stabilize the patient and followed by definite surgery later. It aims to coordinate staged operative interventions with periods of aggressive
resuscitation to salvage trauma patients sustaining major injuries.
The initial focus is hemorrhage control, resuscitation, followed by control and limitation of     contamination. It includes an abbreviated laparotomy, temporary packing, and closure of the abdomen in an e■ort to blunt the physiologic response to prolonged shock and massive
hemorrhage.
After the initial steps of DCS, definitive surgery involving vascular anastomosis may be done. This is individualized to the patient and preferred to be completed in the first 24–72 hours.
Note: vascular anastomosis is the option least likely to be part of the initial stages of DCS. Hence, it is the best option out of the four for this testing point.",,D,
Q19,"All the following are criteria for SIRS, except ______.","a)Systolic BP &lt;9o mmHg
b)Temperature &gt;38 degree celsius or &lt;36 degree celsius
c)Respiratory rate &gt;2o bpm
d)Heart rate &gt;9o/ min","Systolic BP &lt;9o mmHg is not a criterion for SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome). SIRS is diagnosed when two of the following are present:
• Hyperthermia (&gt;38 degrees celsius) or hypothermia (&lt;36 degrees celsius)
• Tachypnoea (&gt;2o/min) or arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCo2) &lt; 32 mmHg
• Tachycardia (&gt;9o/min)

Q20,which is the correct sequence for the correction of hypospadias?,"a)1-&gt;3-&gt;2-&gt;4
b)3-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;4
c)3-&gt;1-&gt;4-&gt;2
d)1-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;2","The correct sequence for the correction of hypospadias is option C: 3-&gt;1-&gt;4-&gt;2
The main principles of surgery in hypospadias, in sequence, include:
• orthoplasty - Chordee correction
• urethroplasty - To reposition the urethral opening and tubularize urethra
• Glanuloplasty - Reconstruction of glans
• Meatoplasty - Reconstruction of distal urethral meatus
• Skin cover and scrotoplasty



Hypospadias is the most common congenital abnormality of the urethra. It is characterized by the combination of a ventrally (underside of penis or perineum) placed urethral meatus, a hooded
foreskin, and ventral chordee (bending of the penis).
The image given below shows the classification of hypospadias:


Perineal hypospadias is the most severe type of deformity.
operations for hypospadias are performed for sexual, urinary stream, or cosmetic reasons. It is done between 6 and 18 months of age.
circumcision should not be done in hypospadias as the foreskin will be used for surgical reconstruction.
Tubularized incised plate (TIP) urethroplasty is the most commonly done procedure. It is done for mid-distal hypospadias.",,C,4969-3099.PNG
Q21,"A female patient presents with a lump in her breast. All the following can be used to rule out malignancy, except _______.","a)Radiological investigations
b)PET scan
c)Clinical examination
d)Histology and cytology","In a patient presenting with breast lump or other suspicions of breast carcinoma a triple
assessment method is used to rule out malignancy. PET scan is used to assess the spread and sites of distant metastasis, it is not used to rule out malignancy. It is also not a part of the triple
assessment.
The triple assessment in the examination of breast lump includes:
• clinical assessment - clinical history and physical examination of the lump.
• Radiological examination - USG/ mammography/ both.
• cytological or histological examination - FNAc (Fine needle aspiration cytology)/ core biopsy of the lump.
Features of malignancy seen on clinical examination can be enlarged axillary lymph nodes,
circumferential retraction of the nipple, peau'd orange appearance of the skin and ulcerations over



the breast. Benign features include non-progressive, smooth, circumscribed, soft, mobile lumps without skin changes.
Microcalcifications seen on breast radiography are also highly suggestive of breast carcinoma.
FNAC and biopsy can detect malignant and atypical cells, suggestive of malignancy.
The triple assessment method has a positive predictive value of about 99.99%. In other words, if all three modalities give negative results, breast cancer can be excluded.",,B,
Q22,"An elderly woman underwent surgical resection of her bowel. After a few months, she
presents with easy fatiguability and tiredness. Blood smear evaluation shows macrocytic anemia. Resection of all the following can cause this, except ______.","a)Jejunum
b)Duodenum
c)Ileum
d)stomach","The given clinical vignette indicates a diagnosis of macrocytic anemia due to either vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) and/or vitamin B9 (folate) deficiency. The resection of the duodenum is least  likely to cause this condition.
The duodenum is involved in iron absorption and hence its resection causes iron deficiency anemia which shows a microcytic hypochromic picture on peripheral blood smear.
The stomach and ileum are involved in the absorption of vitamin B12, and the jejunum is mainly   used in folic acid absorption. Hence, a resection of these segments will result in a deficiency of the vitamins which in turn causes megaloblastic anemia with a peripheral smear

vitamin B12 (cobalamin), is a water-soluble vitamin derived from animal products such as red meat, dairy, and eggs. Absorption of vitamin B12 begins when pepsin in the stomach releases   vitamin B12 from the binding proteins in the food. The released B12 binds to haptocorrin
(R-factor), which is a salivary protein. In the duodenum, pancreatic proteases release B12 from haptocorrin, which then binds to intrinsic factors to form the IF- B12 complex. Intrinsic factor  (IF) is a glycoprotein secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach. In the terminal ileum, this     complex is absorbed by the enterocytes.
pernicious anemia is a specific form of megaloblastic anemia caused by autoimmune gastritis. It is due to impaired production of the intrinsic factor from the parietal cells.It is a common cause of    vitamin B12 deficiency. The other causes of vitamin B12 deficiency are gastrectomy, gastric bypass surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatic insufficiency and so on.





vitamin B9 (folate) is a water-soluble vitamin, and its active form is tetrahydrofolate (THFA).
They are mainly derived from liver, yeast, spinach, other greens, and nuts. Its deficiency results in megaloblastic anemia, homocysteinemia, and neural tube defects (spina bifida, Anencephaly) in      the fetus.
Absorption of vitamin B9 is mainly from the upper small intestine, specifically the proximal jejunum.",,B,4971-3100.PNG

b)propranolol
c)propylthiouracil
d)Betamethasone","potassium iodide can be given in the 7-1o days preoperative period to reduce intraoperative bleeding during total thyroidectomy.
preoperative preparation of a hyperthyroid patient (such as in Graves disease) includes:
• potassium iodide/ Lugol's iodine reduces the vascularity of the thyroid gland and produces transient remission in a hyperthyroid patient.
• Anti-thyroid medications such as carbimazole/propylthiouracil (option C) are started 6-8 weeks before the surgery. They help achieve a euthyroid state by decreasing the synthesis of thyroid
hormones. The last dose of anti-thyroid medication is given in the evening before the day of surgery.
• Beta blockers such as propranolol/nadolol (option B) reduce the risk of thyroid storm by
blocking the adrenergic receptors. They should be continued for 7 days post-operatively as well. The appropriate dosages are propranolol 4o mg TDS or the longer-acting nadolol 16o mg once   daily. They also inhibit the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.

Q28,which of the following is true regarding all types of shock?,"a)Anaerobic respiration produces carbon dioxide
b)Low pH mainly activates lysosomal enzymes
c)peripheral vasoconstriction
d)Renal perfusion is maintained","The true statement among the given options is that low pH mainly activates lysosomal enzymes.
Lysosomes are membraned organelles that enclose all the hydrolyzing enzymes capable of
breaking down biological polymers. The lysosomal enzymes are only active in acidic pH (low pH  value) and this pH is maintained within the organelle. Hypoxic tissue injury during shock causes membrane damage, and extravasation of the enzymes from lysosomes. Thus, leading to tissue
death.
other options:
option A: Anaerobic respiration produces lactic acid. Accumulation of lactic acid causes metabolic acidosis.
option C: peripheral vasoconstriction is seen in all types of shock, except septic shock.
option D: Renal perfusion is maintained during the compensated shock stages. There is renal decompensation as shock progresses causing oliguria, and eventually anuria.
shock is a state of circulatory failure resulting in tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia. prolonged shock eventually leads to irreversible tissue damage.
In cases of shock, there is inadequate oxygenation. Thus cells switch from aerobic to anaerobic    respiration where lactic acid, not carbon dioxide, is produced. The accumulation of lactic acid in the blood leads to systemic acidosis.
shock progresses through a series of well-defined stages:
• Initial nonprogressive stage: Compensatory neurohumoral mechanisms come into play to preserve tissue perfusion.
• progressive stage: Tissue hypoperfusion leads to circulatory and metabolic disturbances.
Acidosis occurs due to intracellular anaerobic glycolysis. This causes peripheral pooling, thereby leading to reduced cardiac output and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).



• Irreversible stage: Tissue injury cannot be reversed even with hemodynamic correction. There is  worsening myocardial contractility, renal function impairment, and bacteremia (due to the release of intestinal flora into the circulation).
The various types of shock are shown in the images below:",,B,4976-3106.PNG;4977-3107.PNG;4977-3108.PNG;4977-3109.PNG
Q29,"A patient presents with multiple stab injuries to the chest. on examination, there is reduced chest movement on the right side and tracheal deviation to the left side. Additionally, the
neck veins are distended. what is the next best step in the management of this patient?","a)Resuscitative thoracotomy
b)ICD placement
c)Needle thoracocentesis
d)Finger thoracotomy","Multiple stab injuries to the chest, reduced chest movement on the right side, tracheal deviation  to the left side, and distension of neck veins suggest a diagnosis of tension pneumothorax on the right side. The next best step in the management would be needle thoracocentesis (emergent
management).
ICD placement (option B) is the definitive management of the tension pneumothorax, inserted after performing the initial emergency procedure.
Tension pneumothorax develops when a ""one-way valve"" air leak occurs causing air to get sucked in and get collected between the lung and chest wall causing the ipsilateral lung to collapse.
It is characterized by chest pain, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, tracheal deviation away from the side of injury, unilateral absence of breath sound, cyanosis, and neck vein distension.
Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis and treatment is started without waiting for radiological confirmation.
The next step/ immediate management is chest decompression by rapid insertion of a large-bore cannula on the affected side (needle thoracocentesis) in the appropriate space.
If it is not successful, finger thoracostomy can be tried.
ICD placement is mandatory after needle or finger decompression ofthe chest and is
the definitive management. This should be followed by confirmation of position by chest X-ray. Recent update (Acc. to ATLS 1oth edition):
• In adults, the needle thoracotomy location was changed from the 2nd ICS midclavicular line to the 5th intercostal space (ICS) mid-axillary line.

The  next line of management in this condition is administration of IV fluids (option A) and exploratory laparotomy(option C).
Hollow viscus perforation is a life-threatening condition. In pUD, the perforation most commonly occurs as a complication of anterior duodenal ulcers and gastric ulcers.This results in leakage of    gastric contents into the abdomen resulting in acute chemical peritonitis.
Clinical features of perforation include abdominal pain and distension, nausea, vomiting,
tachycardia, tenderness, guarding &amp; rigidity, rebound tenderness and decreased or absent bowel sounds. Fever may be present. sometimes, features of septic shock can be seen at later    stages.

b)cosmetically better
c)Earlier return to normal physiological function
d)Longer duration of stay in hospital","Longer duration of stay in the hospital is not an advantage of laparoscopic surgeries.
Laparoscopic surgeries are performed by introducing a rigid laparoscope through a port into the peritoneal cavity. Carbon dioxide is insufflated into the abdominal cavity to create a
pneumoperitoneum. The other laparoscopic instruments used for dissection are introduced via other surgically created ports.
Evidence shows that laparoscopic surgery has short-term benefits over open surgery.
Laparoscopic surgery has a better outcome with regard to blood loss, postoperative pain, length of stay, better cosmetic appearance, fewer adhesions, better anatomical perception, and earlier
recovery.

steps in the management of ANC:
• Aggressive fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid solution, pain control, and early nutrition, similar to acute pancreatitis
• CECT is done to diagnose ANC. The Balthazar score is used to grade severity based on CT findings.
• Infection screening:
• one of the main complications ofANC is infection. If infected necrosis is suspected, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is done, and the aspirate is subjected to Gram staining and culture sensitivity.
• once the infection is confirmed, IV antibiotics are started. Carbapenem is the first-choice drug. The other drugs that can be used include quinolones, metronidazole, third-generation
cephalosporins, and piperacillin.

Q47,"A 25-year-old woman presents with a breast lump with no skin changes or induration. on
histology, there was a fibroadenoma appearance. which of the following categories does it fall



under?","a)BIRADS 1 and 2
b)BIRADS 2 or 4
c)BIRADS 2, 3, 4
d)BIRADS 2","Fibroadenoma is a benign tumor in a 25-year-old woman with no skin changes and no indurations and is categorized as BIRADS 2.
Fibroadenoma is a form of aberrations of normal development and involution of the breast (ANDI), and it is the most common cause of a breast lump in women aged 15–25 years.



It arises from hyperplasia of a single lobule and presents as a well-circumscribed, smooth or
lobular, firm, non-tender, freely mobile mass (mouse in the breast). The histopathology shows the proliferation of intralobular stroma, and the epithelium may be surrounded by stroma
(pericanalicular pattern) or compressed and distorted (intracanalicular pattern).
USG is done to confirm the diagnosis. A biopsy is needed if USG shows atypical features or the age of presentation is above 25 years.

Q48,which of the following is not a contraindication for breast conservative surgery?,"a)Tumor size &lt; 4cm, with N1 axillary metastasis
b)Tumor more than the size of the breast
c)prior chest irradiation
d)Multifocal tumors","Tumor size &lt; 4cm, with N1 axillary metastasis is not a contraindication for breast conservative surgery.
Breast conservative therapy (BCT) involves resection of primary breast cancer with adequate normal breast tissue, adjuvant radiotherapy, and assessment of regional lymph nodes via a    separate incision in the axilla. Removal of primary breast cancer is also called lumpectomy/   tylectomy/ partial mastectomy/ wide local excision.
Absolute contraindications of BCT:
• pregnancy
• persistently positive margin (2 microscopy shows positive margins)
• Multicentric lumps
• Diffuse microcalcification
•
Extensive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
•
Inflammatory breast cancer



Relative contraindications of BCT:
• Active SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), scleroderma
• Large lump-to-breast ratio (&gt;5 cm size lump)
• known or suspected genetic predisposition to breast cancer (i.e., BRCA1, BRCA2), Li-Fraumeni syndrome (p53 mutation)
• Multifocal disease
• prior radiation therapy to the chest wall or breast",,A,
