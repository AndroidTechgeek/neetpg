Q1,ventilatory support is required if Spo2 becomes less than 9o% because,"a)Tissues become vulnerable for hypoxia below 9o%.
b)peripheral chemoreceptors becomes insensitive to hypoxia below 9o%.
c)central chemoreceptors becomes insensitive to hypoxia below 9o%.
d)patient capacity to generate adequate tidal volume decreases below 9o%.","Tissues become vulnerable to hypoxia when Spo2 falls below 9o% and thus supplementary oxygen therapy is indicated below this oxygen saturation level.
In adults, children, and infants (older than 1 month), when Spo2 falls below 9o%, the pao2    becomes less than 6o mmHg and hence to prevent tissues from hypoxia, supplemental oxygen therapy should be started.
In neonates, when Spo2 falls below 88%, the pao2 becomes less than 5o mmmHg and hence supplemental oxygen therapy should be initiated in these patients.",,A,
Q2,"In conventional oxygen therapy, which device will deliver highest Fio2?","a)venturi mask
b)Hudson mask
c)Non rebreathing mask
d)Nasal cannula","Non rebreathing masks provide highest Fio2 during conventional oxygen therapy.
The non-rebreather mask is a low flow device that can be used to deliver oxygen at higher
concentrations (Fio2 8o-95%). It uses a reservoir bag to let the oxygen get concentrated while a one-way valve doesn't allow to breathe in expired air.
This type of masks are used in patients with significant hypoxia, with relatively normal ventilation, such as victims of trauma or carbon monoxide exposure.


other options:
A) venturi mask:



• venturi mask is a high-flow, fixed-performance oxygen delivery system and the highest oxygen concentration (Fio2) delivered is 6o% at a flow rate of 15 L/min.
• It is based on the Bernoulli Principle, which states that in order to maintain a constant flow, a fluid must increase its velocity as it flows through a constriction.
• It is available in different colors, with the green valve venturi mask providing 6o% Fio2.
• This is useful with patients who require greater Fio2 such as CoPD patients, where it is important to provide controlled oxygenation.


B) Hudson mask:
• Also known as simple face mask
• Low-flow, variable performance device
• They provide an oxygen flow rate of up to 5-1o L/min and provide a variable Fio2.
• The body of the mask functions as reservoir for both oxygen and expired carbon dioxide.
• used in patients who require oxygen therapy for shorter periods of time.





D) Nasal cannula:
• They are low-flow, variable performance devices, with flow rate of 1-4 L/min.
• used in patients who require low supplemental oxygen.
• Nasopharynx acts as the reservoir in such cannulas.
Indications of a nasal cannula and other low-flow oxygen delivery systems include
• Minute ventilation &lt; 8–1o L/min
• Breathing frequencies &lt; 2o breaths/min
• Normal inspiratory flow (1o–3o L/min).",,C,3450-2156.PNG;3451-2157.PNG;3452-2159.PNG;3452-2158.PNG
Q3,what is the nerve blocked in the following local anesthesia technique?,"a)Nasociliary nerve
b)Anterior ethmoidal nerve
c)Sphenopalatine nerve
d)Greater palatine nerve","The given image shows a nasociliary nerve block.
The procedure is done by inserting the needle 1 cm superior and 1.5 cm posterolateral to the medial canthal ligament of the eye.
The nasociliary nerve is a branch of the ophthalmic nerve which in turn is a branch of the trigeminal nerve.
Branches:
• Long ciliary nerve- cornea, ciliary body, iris
• Ramus communicans to the ciliary ganglion
• posterior ethmoidal nerve- sensory innervation to frontal sinus and posterior ethmoidal air cells
• Anterior ethmoidal nerve- sensory innervation to middle and anterior ethmoidal cells as well as lateral part of the nasal septum
• Infra-trochlear nerve (continuation of the nasociliary nerve)- provides innervation to the conjunctiva, lacrimal sac, caruncle, the medial part of the eyelids
uses of nasociliary nerve block:
used in
• surgery of nasal fractures, • septoplasty,
• Rhinoplasty and
• Repair of skin laceration.

Q4,"How long should elective surgery be deferred for a patient who had cough and fever, after he has recovered from COVID-19, and had not required any hospitalization?","a)6 weeks
b)8-1o weeks
c)12 weeks
d)4 weeks","A patient, who has recovered from COVID-19 and hadn’t required any hospitalization should be deferred from any elective surgery for a period of 6 weeks.
The American society of Anesthesiologists has suggested the following duration of intervals for
patients recovered from COVID-19. The wait time is from the date of diagnosis of COVID-19 to the date of surgery as follows:
• 4 weeks: for an asymptomatic patient or recovery from only mild, non-respiratory symptoms.
• 6 weeks: for a symptomatic patient (e.g: cough, dyspnea) who did not require hospitalization
• 8-1o weeks: for a symptomatic patient who is hospitalized or who has comorbidities such as diabetes or who is immunocompromised.
• 12 weeks: for a patient who was admitted in intensive care unit due to COVID-19 infection.",,A,
Q5,"A 42-year-old man who was under home isolation after testing positive for COVID-19,
develops breathing difficulty and is brought to the ER. The patient is alert and responsive, but is breathing rapidly. SpO2 is measured to be 86%. He is administered oxygen via a face mask with a reservoir bag with a flow rate of 1o L/min. After a trial of one hour, his SpO2 is 88%.    what is the next step in management?","a)Increase flow rate to 15 L/min
b)High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy
c)Endotracheal intubation
d)No specific intervention necessary","This patient has persistent hypoxia after an adequate trial of standard oxygen therapy and should be started on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy.
when respiratory distress and/or hypoxemia of the patient cannot be alleviated after receiving
standard oxygen therapy, high–flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNO), or non–invasive
ventilation can be considered. Compared to standard oxygen therapy, HFNO reduces the need for intubation.
patients on HFNO should be closely monitored, and endotracheal intubation should be done if the patient acutely deteriorates or does not improve after a short trial (about 1 hr).



Patients with hypercapnia (exacerbation of CoPD), hemodynamic instability, multi-organ failure, or abnormal mental status should not receive HFNo.
Note: If a high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or simple nasal cannula is used to administer o2, an N95 mask should be applied over it.
some of the benefits of HFNC are
• It can deliver oxygen at 4oL/min, 37°C, and 99.9% relative humidity.
• The high-flow oxygen is delivered directly to the nasopharynx. This produces Fio2 equal to that delivered by traditional mask devices.
• It also reduces the work of breathing, improves gas exchange by nasopharyngeal dead-space washout, and decreases energy required to humidify and heat respiratory gases.
The HFNC equipment shown in the image below uses a heated humidifier (named PMH2oo), a nasal cannula (no. 2), and a ventilator (brand: vivo3o).",,B,3426-2143.PNG
Q6,what is the mechanism of action of local anesthetics?,"a)Block sodium channels
b)Block potassium channels
c)Block calcium channels
d)Block chloride channels","Local anesthetics primarily act by blocking the sodium channels bound to the membrane.
sodium channels have one larger α subunit and one or two smaller β subunits. These
voltage-gated sodium channels exist in 3 states :
• Resting (non conducting)
• open (conducting) and
• Inactivated (non conducting)
The local anesthetics bind to the α subunit of sodium channels, thereby preventing their activation and inhibiting the influx of sodium.
Local anesthetics have a higher affinity for the sodium channels in open and inactivated state than in the resting state.



Local anesthetic inhibition is both voltage and frequency-dependent and is higher when nerve fibers are firing rapidly than with slow, infrequent depolarizations.
Note:
Local anesthetics may also bind and inhibit calcium, potassium, transient receptor potential
vanilloid 1 (TRpV1) and many other channels and receptors. But blocking of sodium channels is the best answer, of all the given options.",,A,
Q7,You are in the operating room and notice the tracing in yellow color on this device. what does it indicate?,"a)capnography
b)Airway pressure
c)o2 pressure in inhaled air
d)o2 pressure in exhaled air","The reading marked as X in the monitor is the capnography.
waveform capnography is a continuous non-invasive measurement and graphical display of the Etco2.
It is a direct measure of lung ventilation and an indirect measure of circulation and metabolism.
The normal capnograph displays the exhaled co2 in both inspiratory and expiratory phases. The expiratory phase is divided into three distinct components:
• phase I: exhalation of dead space gas (i.e., partial pressure of co2, pco2 ~o).
• phase II: A sharp rise in pco2 to a plateauindicates the sampling of transitional gas between the airways and alveoli.
• phase III: The plateau region of the capnograph, corresponds to the pco2 in the alveolar compartment.
• Following phase III, a sharp inspiratory downstroke occurs, which is referred to as the beginning of phase o or phase IV by some.",3447-2155.PNG,A,3456-2160.PNG
Q8,what is the most common cause for hospital admission after day care surgery?,"a)Respiratory distress
b)post surgical pain
c)postoperative nausea and vomiting
d)Bleeding","Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is the most common cause of unanticipated hospital admission following daycare surgery.
The two most common complications of daycare surgery are PONV and postoperative pain. PONV refers to the presentation of symptoms in the postoperative care unit or within 24 hours of the
procedure. Pain is usually managed preoperatively and postoperatively with the administration of analgesics. while it is a common complication, postoperative pain is not the most common cause  of unanticipated hospital admission. Opioid medications which are commonly used to treat
postoperative pain present with side effects such as nausea and vomiting which may aggravate PONV.
The occurrence of PONV can be based on the following factors, patient, choice of anesthetic agent, and the procedure. The risk factors are:
• Patient: women (higher incidence in pregnancy), history of PONV or motion sickness, nonsmokers, younger age (incidence decreases as the age increases).
• Anesthetic agent: General anesthesia, inhalational agents (isoflurane, sevoflurane), nitrous oxide, longer duration of anesthesia, preoperative opioid administration.
• Procedure: Laparoscopic procedures, lithotripsy, gynecologic procedures, adenotonsillectomy, strabismus surgery.
The drugs used in the prophylaxis and treatment of PONV include ondansetron, dexamethasone, and transdermal scopolamine.",,C,
Q9,what is the frequency of tetanic stimulation used in neuromuscular monitoring?,"a)o.2 Hz
b)2 Hz
c)2o Hz
d)5o Hz","The commonly used frequency of tetanic stimulation in neuromuscular monitoring is 5o Hz.
Tetanic stimulation is a method to evaluate residual neuromuscular blockade.
Tetanic stimulation consists of a series of extremely rapid electrical stimuli typically applied over
5 seconds. The most commonly used frequency is 5o Hz stimulation given for 5 seconds.
• During a depolarizing block, the muscle response to 5o Hz tetanic stimulation for 5 seconds is sustained.
• In contrast, during a phase II block after the injection of succinylcholine, the response following tetanic stimulation is not sustained i.e., a fade occurs.
Disadvantages of tetanic stimulation are:
• This method has only 7o% sensitivity to detect residual paralysis and its specificity is only about 5o%. Hence, this test is of limited value for assessing neuromuscular recovery.
• This method is very painful, which makes it difficult to use in unanesthetized patients.
• During the late phase of neuromuscular recovery, tetanic stimulation can produce lasting
antagonism of neuromuscular block in the stimulated muscle. This may change the response of the tested site such that it may no longer be representative of other muscle groups.
Note:



other patterns of nerve stimulations, which are used to assess the patients for residual blockade are
• Train of four stimulation: Here four supramaximal stimuli (2 Hz) are delivered every o.5 seconds.
• Double-burst stimulation: Here two short bursts of 5o Hz tetanic stimuli is delivered, which are separated by 75o ms.",,D,
Q10,"A 6o-year-old male patient was undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. During the
surgery, a sudden drop in Etco2 to 8 mmHg was noted. His Spo2 became 9o%, his blood     pressure dropped to 8o/5o mmHg, and peak airway pressure was 18 cm of H2o. what is the diagnosis?","a)Both 1 and 2
b)Both 3 and 4
c)1 only
d)2 only","A sudden fall in EtCo2 with hypotension (fall in BP to 8o/5o mmHg) along with normal airway pressure (&lt; 35 to 4o cm of H2o) during surgery is suggestive of Co2 embolism.
Intraoperative pulmonary embolism usually presents as sudden cardiovascular collapse and
hypoxemia with a sudden fall in EtCo2. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the most
sensitive device for detecting intracardiac air embolus. If air is identified in the right atrium, or if it is suspected, immediate central vein cannulation and aspiration of the air may be lifesaving.
The placement of a vena cava filter should be considered postoperatively.
The best method to confirm the position of the endotracheal tube is the end-tidal Co2
concentration assessed by capnography.
other options:
Intraoperative bronchospasm is usually manifested as wheezing, increasing peak airway pressure, and a slowly rising waveform on the capnograph.


A pneumothorax may manifest as hypercapnia along with hypoxemia, hypotension, increased peak airway pressure, and decreasing tidal volumes. It may result in abrupt cardiovascular
collapse unresponsive to fluid and vasopressor administration.
Deep sulcus sign on a supine chest radiograph points towards pneumothorax. The costophrenic angle is abnormally deepened when the pleural air collects laterally, producing the deep sulcus



sign.
The below chest X-ray shows left pneumothorax. Notice the collapsed lung and absent lung markings on the left side. Also mediastinal shift towards the right side.


Endobronchial intubation shows increased peak expiratory pressure, hypoxemia, increased airway pressure, asymmetric chest expansion and the absence of breath sounds over one lung, generally    the left.
Note: peak airway pressure is the amount of airway pressure delivered by the ventilator to overcome the resistance of the endotracheal tube, airway, and alveoli.",,C,3458-2161.PNG;3459-2162.PNG
Q11,The maximum oxygen flow rate which can be kept with a conventional oxygen mask is,"a)5 L/min
b)15 L/min
c)1o L/min
d)2o L/min","The maximum oxygen flow rate which can be kept with a conventional oxygen mask is 1o L/min.   A conventional oxygen mask is a simple face mask that is used routinely in hospitals. It covers the nose and mouth of the patient. There are 2 exhalation ports through which the patient exhales
carbon dioxide. This mask is held in place with elastic around the back of the head and a metal   piece that fits over the nose. It provides 4o% to 6o% of o2 concentration and delivers o2 at the rate of 6 to 1o L/min.





conventional oxygen therapy includes all the devices that are used in routine practices. It includes nasal prongs, low-flow nasal cannula, or masks. It is the main supportive treatment administered  to patients after planned extubation.
oxygen delivery devices can be broadly divided into low flow oxygen devices (eg: nasal cannula, simple face mask, non-rebreathing mask) and high flow oxygen devices (eg: venturi mask).
Important note- If the question is about the maximum flow rate with the conventional oxygen
mask, it would be 1oL/ min. whereas if the question is asking about the maximum oxygen flow    rate with conventional oxygen therapy, then it would include all the conventionally used devices. Therefore, the answer would be 15L/min.
The below image shows a nasal cannula, which delivers oxygen at 1-6 L/min.

oxygen delivery device s	Flow rate (liter/min)	Approximate F io2
Nasal cannula	1-6	o.24-o.44
simple face mask	6-1o	o.4o-o.6o
Non-rebreathing mask	1o-15	o.9o-1.oo
venturi mask	2-15	o.24-o.6o






The below image shows a non-rebreathing mask that provides an oxygen flow rate of up to 1o-15 L/min.


The below image shows a venturi mask, which delivers oxygen at 2-15 L/min.",,C,3480-2171.PNG;3452-2158.PNG;3450-2156.PNG;3451-2157.PNG
Q12,"which of the following can be used for induction of anesthesia, maintenance and can be safely used in endotracheal intubation?","a)Halothane
b)Desflurane
c)Sevoflurane
d)Isoflurane","Among the given options, sevoflurane can be used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. It can also be safely used in endotracheal intubation
Inhalation agents such as sevoflurane and halothane are useful in the induction of anesthesia, But sevoflurane due to its nonpungency and rapid onset makes it an excellent choice for smooth and    rapid inhalation inductions in pediatric and adult patients. sevoflurane has low blood solubility
and partition coefficients resulting in more rapid emergence.
sevoflurane also produces adequate muscle relaxation for intubation of children following an inhalation induction.
other options:
option A: Halothane can also be used for gaseous induction of anesthesia. Its disadvantage is long induction time owing to the high blood:gas partition coefficient. However, the incidence of
halothane hepatitis and myocardial depression has reduced its use.
option B: Desflurane produces laryngospasm when used for inhalational anesthesia and hence it is not used for induction. Laryngospasm is because of the pungent nature of the gas.
option D: Isoflurane causes respiratory depression as well as upper respiratory irritation.",,C,
Q13,"During resuscitation, a patient received a 2o% Intralipid injection. what could have been the most probable diagnosis?","a)Local anaesthesia toxicity
b)Asphxyia due to drowning
c)Electrocution
d)Pulseless electrical activity","patients who are unresponsive due to local anesthesia toxicity require 2o% Intralipid injection during resuscitation.
Accidental intravascular injection of local anesthetic like bupivacaine results
in bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity.



Initial management includes immediate initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation as per the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) algorithm.
• Following CPR, Intralipid therapy is initiated. A rapid bolus of Intralipid 2o% IV (1.5 mL/kg) is administered without delay, followed by an infusion of o.25 mL/kg/min. The infusion should be   given continuously for at least 1o minutes after hemodynamic stability is achieved.
• Intralipid decreases cardiac bupivacaine concentration by 11% within 3 minutes of administration, and cerebral bupivacaine concentration by 18% within 15 minutes.
Bupivacaine is a long-acting local anesthetic that is the most cardiotoxic among the local
anesthetics. It depresses the rapid phase of depolarization in Purkinje fibers and ventricular
muscle due to a decreased availability of fast sodium channels in cardiac membranes. This
reduced rate of depolarization depresses myocardial contractility. Hence, bupivacaine is a potent cardio-depressant.
Note: Local anesthesia systemic toxicity (LAST) can also affect the central nervous system (CNS), which is more susceptible to local anesthetic action as compared to the cardiovascular system.
Dizziness, tinnitus, and disorientation are the initial symptoms. Shivering, muscular twitching, and tremors follow. Tonic-clonic seizures occur. Finally, respiratory depression can lead to
respiratory arrest.",,A,
Q14,A 5o-year-old male patient has grade 3 ASA. which of the following postbronchodilator PFT findings requires further evaluation of the lung function of the patient?,"a)FEV1 &lt; o.85 and FEV1/FVC &lt;o.8
b)FEV1 &lt; o.85 and FEV1/FVC &lt;o.75
c)FEV1 &lt; o.8 and FEV1/FVC &lt;o.7
d)FEV1 &lt; o.8 and FEV1/FVC &lt;o.75","FEV1 &lt;o.8 and FEV1/FVC &lt;o.7 are classified as moderate COPD under GOLD classification and they require further evaluation of the lung function.
Preoperative pulmonary function tests (PFTs) assess the severity of known pulmonary disease, diagnose causes of respiratory symptoms, and may help to identify patients who are at risk for postoperative pulmonary complications.
The severity of COPD is assessed by using the Global Initiative for Lung Disease (GOLD)    criteria. In pulmonary function testing, a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of &lt;o.7o is considered diagnostic for COPD.
The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) system categorizes airflow limitation into stages. In patients with FEV1/FVC &lt;o.7o:
• GOLD 1: mild: FEV1 ≥8o% predicted
• GOLD 2: moderate: 5o% ≤ FEV1 &lt;8o% predicted
• GOLD 3: severe: 3o% ≤ FEV1 &lt;5o% predicted
• GOLD 4: very severe: FEV1 &lt;3o% predicted.
This is important in the perioperative period as the diagnosis of COPD is an independent and significant risk factor in the development of postoperative pulmonary complications.
Pre-operative FEV1 and DLCO of &gt;8o% imply a lower risk for a permanent postoperative
pulmonary disability. Below these values, further risk-benefit assessment of the surgery needs to be examined and more information should obtained.",,C,
