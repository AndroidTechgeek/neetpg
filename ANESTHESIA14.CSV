Q1,which of the following is a 2nd generation LMA device?,"a)Intubating LMA
b)Proseal LMA
c)Flexible LMA
d)Ambu LMA","proseal LMA is a 2nd generation LMA device as it has a separate gastric tube to decompress the  stomach and prevent gastric aspiration associated with the classical LMA or 1st generation LMA. other 2nd generation LMA's include LMA Supreme, I-Gel and LMA protector.






All other options are examples of 1st generation LMA's since they do not have a separate gastric tube to aspirate for gastric secretions.
Flexible LMA allows the tube complete flexibility and resistance to compression so that the head and neck can be turned without dislodging the mask.
The intubating LMA (ILMA) and Ambu LMA(ALMA) are variants of the LMA Classic, a 1st generation LMA used to aid in intubation of the patient in difficult airways.





Note : Although Ambu LMAs are produced as 1st generation and 2nd generation LMA, proseal is exclusively a 2nd generation LMA and hence the best answer to this question.",,B,3496-2179.PNG;3497-2180.PNG;3496-2178.PNG
Q2,"A patient was planned for surgery under general anaesthesia. During induction of
anaesthesia, rocuronium 85 mg was given and the patient was tried to be intubated. It   resulted in a failed intubation. which of the following drugs can be given for immediate reversal of the drug?","a)Neostigmine
b)Glycopyrrolate
c)sugammadex
d)Edrophonium","sugammadex is used for immediate reversal of rocuronium induced neuromuscular
blockade/relaxant in the given scenario.(option C)
sugammadex is a modified γ-cyclodextrin and the first selective relaxant–binding agent based on an encapsulating principle for inactivation of nondepolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs
mainly rocuronium and vecuronium. This principle of complex formation of sugammadex and    rocuronium or vecuronium in a 1:1 ratio occurs at all levels of neuromuscular blockade resulting in a more fast-acting pharmacologic reversal when compared with anticholinesterase drugs like  neostigmine.
The stability ofthe rocuronium-sugammadex complex is a result of van der waals forces,
hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. There is some binding affinity with pancuronium, but this interaction is too low to have a significant clinical effect.
other options:
option A: Neostigmine is used to reverse depolarising neuromuscular blockade such as
succinylcholine, especially in the phase II block(fade of the train-of-four response) and sufficient time has passed for the circulating concentration of succinylcholine to be negligible. Therefore,   neostigmine is slow-acting compared to sugammadex but the agent preferred in the case of
succinylcholine.
Neostigmine administration during phase I block, increases neuromuscular Ach concentration     and inhibits pseudocholinesterase (plasma cholinesterase) activity that can prolong the action of succinylcholine, hence it is given after some time during the phase II block.
option B: To prevent cholinergic side-effects of neostigmine, glycopyrrolate is co-administered in a 1:5 ratio to neostigmine(o.2mg: 1 mg). Atropine is an alternative but glycopyrrolate is preferred



due to the incidence of tachycardia associated with atropine.
option D: Edrophonium is a short-acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor preferred in the case of mivacurium reversal since it does not show plasma cholinesterase inhibition present in
neostigmine that can prolong mivacurium action.",,C,
Q3,which of the following are components of high-quality cardio-pulmonary resuscitation(CPR) in adults?,"a)1,2 and 3
b)1,3 and 4
c)2,3 and 4
d)3 and 4 only","The depth of compression should be at least 5cm to ensure high-quality CPR in an adult cardiac arrest.
The foundation of CPR is high-quality chest compressions. Compressing the chest pumps blood from the heart to the brain and then to the rest ofthe body. Each time the compressions are
stopped, the blood flow from the heart decreases significantly. once resumed, it takes several compressions to bring the blood flow back up to the levels present before the interruption.
The components of high-quality chest compressions in adults are as follows :
• Position victim - Position the victim face up on a firm, flat surface. This allows compression of the heart to create adequate blood flow.
• Compression-to-ventilation ratio - single rescuers should use the compression-to-ventilation ratio of 3o compressions to 2 breaths when giving CPR to victims of any age.
• Compression rate - Compress at a rate of 1oo to 12o/min. This rate is the same for compression in all cardiac arrest victims.
• Compression depth - Compress the chest at least 5cm. Compressing the chest more than 6 cm in adults may decrease the effectiveness of the compression and cause injuries. using a CPR-quality  feedback device can help reach the optimal depth.
• Chest recoil - Allow the chest to recoil completely after each compression. This allows blood to flow into the heart. To help ensure complete recoil, avoid leaning on the chest between
compressions. Chest compression and chest reoil times should be about equal.
• Interruptions in chest compressions - Minimize interruptions in chest compression. the proportion of time that rescuers perform chest compressions during CPR is called chest   compression fraction (CCF). A CCF of 8o% or higher should be the goal.",,B,
Q4,what is the inhalational anaesthetic agent used for induction in children?,"a)Nitrous oxide
b)Isoflurane
c)sevoflurane
d)Desflurane","sevoflurane is the inhalational anaesthetic agent used for induction in children. (option C)
It is the preferred agent due to its non-pungent sweet-smelling nature and rapid increase in
alveolar concentration on administration. Its low blood solubility helps during emergence from the effects of anaesthesia, reducing the post-operative delay in the patient's recovery from
anaesthesia.
Desflurane and isoflurane are avoided for inhalation induction because they are pungent and
associated with coughing, breath-holding and laryngospasm. They are usually used for the
maintenance of anaesthesia. Desflurane is preferred in patients with renal and liver disease and



isoflurane is preferred in neurosurgery and cardiac surgery.
Due to its second-gas effect, nitrous oxide is mainly used as a carrier gas for other inhalational agents and not given alone.",,C,
Q5,Ambu Aura 4o is an example of?,"a)supraglottic laryngeal airway generation 1
b)supraglottic laryngeal airway generation 2
c)supraglottic laryngeal airway generation 3
d)supraglottic laryngeal airway generation 4","The Ambu Aura 4o is an example of a first-generation supraglottic airway device.
Supraglottic airway (SGA) devices are classified into different generations based on their features and advancements:
First-generation SGA devices: Basic devices designed to provide a seal around the glottis for
ventilation. They lack additional safety features, such as protection against aspiration. Examples include the original Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA Classic) and Ambu Aura 4o (can be reused up to 4o times),
Second-generation SGA devices: These are improved devices with additional features to enhance safety and functionality. They typically have:
A gastric access channel (to allow gastric decompression or reduce the risk of regurgitation and aspiration).
Improved sealing mechanisms. Examples: Ambu Aura Gain (with drain tube), LMA proSeal, and i-gel.
Third-generation and Fourth-generation devices: These are not standard classifications in clinical practice yet. However, devices beyond the second generation may feature advanced integration
with monitoring systems, adjustable seals, or further innovations.",,A,
Q6,which of the following drugs causes adrenal suppression?,"a)Thiopental
b)ketamine
c)Etomidate
d)propofol","Etomidate causes adrenal suppression which can last for 72 hours.
Etomidate inhibits 11β-hydroxylase, resulting in decreased biosynthesis of cortisol and
mineralocorticoids and increases the formation of intermediaries like 11-deoxycorticosterone.
It is a more potent inhibitor of steroid synthesis than as a sedative-hypnotic as the concentration which produces adrenocortical suppression (1o ng/mL)is much lower than that needed for
hypnosis (&gt;2oo ng/mL).
This suppression is particularly concerning in critically ill patients, where stress-induced cortisol production is vital for survival.
other options:
option A: Thiopental: primarily causes sedation and hypnosis.
option B: ketamine: Does not cause adrenal suppression. Instead, it may slightly stimulate adrenal catecholamine release due to its action on the sympathetic nervous system.
option D: propofol: Can cause CNS depression without direct impact on adrenal hormone synthesis.",,C,
Q7,which of the following is incorrect regarding thiopentone?,"a)It is lipid soluble
b)It achieves maximum concentration in the brain after an IV infusion
c)Redistribution to adipose tissue and muscle is seen
d)Rapid decline in its effect is due to renal excretion","The rapid decline in the effect of thiopentone is due to its rapid redistribution, not due to renal excretion.
Thiopentone has a rapid onset of action because of its lipophilic nature, so it rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier and enters highly perfused organs like the brain, heart, liver, and kidneys.
As thiopentone redistributes from the brain to tissues: it perfuses to muscle, fat, and skin. over time, due to its high lipid solubility, thiopentone accumulates maximally in fat. Fat acts as a
storage reservoir since it has low blood flow, and drug release from fat occurs slowly.
This redistribution reduces the concentration of thiopentone, terminating its anesthetic effect.
other options:
option A: It is lipid-soluble: Thiopentone is highly lipid soluble, which allows it to cross the blood-brain barrier quickly and achieve rapid onset of action in the CNS.
option B: It achieves maximum concentration in the brain after an IV infusion: Due to its lipophilicity, thiopentone rapidly accumulates in the brain after IV administration.
option C: Redistribution to adipose tissue and muscle is seen: Thiopentone’s effect is terminated   by redistribution from the brain to adipose tissue and muscle. This accounts for the short duration of its anesthetic effect.",,D,
Q8,"A female following an RTA injured her chest. on X-ray, a fracture of 3 to 5th ribs was noted. pain was not responsive to analgesics. which block will be given to reduce the pain?","a)cervical block
b)Thoracic epidural block
c)supraclavicular block
d)Lumbar epidural block","A thoracic epidural block will be given to reduce the rib fracture pain.
Epidural anaesthesia is used to provide adequate analgesia which is the mainstay of treatment in patients with multiple rib fractures.
The complications can be minimized by adequate pain relief with epidural anaesthesia. Rib fracture patients will have the following complications due to splinting and pain:
• Hypoventilation
• Hypoxia
other techniques to provide analgesia following rib fractures are intercostal nerve block and intrapleural block which necessitates multiple injections, which increases the risk for
complications.
The complications include vascular puncture, pneumothorax, patient discomfort due to the need for palpation of the fractured rib during local anaesthetic (LA) administration. Also, LA toxicity   can occur because of the high systemic absorption.
Rib fractures can cause severe pain that does not respond well to conventional analgesics. A thoracic epidural block is effective for pain relief in this area because it provides segmental   anesthesia to the thoracic dermatomes and surrounding structures, helping reduce pain and improve respiratory function.



Indications of thoracic epidural block:
• Postoperative pain relief: After thoracic or upper abdominal surgeries.
• Trauma management: Rib fractures to reduce pain and improve ventilation.
• Chronic pain syndromes: Postherpetic neuralgia or cancer-related pain.
other options:
option A: Cervical block: used primarily for pain management or anesthesia involving the neck and upper shoulders.
option C: supraclavicular block: used for anesthesia of the upper limb by blocking the brachial plexus.
option D: Lumbar epidural block: used for lower body anesthesia, including the pelvis and lower extremities.",,B,
Q9,which of the following will lead to a decrease in diastolic BP?,"a)systemic infusion of alpha-adrenergic blocker
b)systemic infusion of smooth muscle relaxant
c)Loss of lumbar sympathetic outflow
d)systemic infusion of beta-1 adrenergic agonist","Loss of lumbar sympathetic outflow will lead to a decrease in diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
Loss or blockade of the lumbar sympathetic chain (spinal anaesthesia) causes dilation of
capacitance (venous) vessels. This leads to a decrease in diastolic blood pressure and subsequent orthostatic lightheadedness or syncope.
vasodilation is more marked on the venous than on the arterial side of the circulation, resulting in blood pooling in the venous capacitance vessels. This reduction in circulating blood volume is well tolerated at low levels of spinal anaesthesia in healthy patients. with an increasing level of block,   this effect becomes more marked, and venous return becomes gravity-dependent. If venous return decreases too much, cardiac output and organ perfusion decline sharply.
other options:
option A: systemic infusion of alpha-adrenergic blocker will minimally decrease diastolic BP, not significantly like in loss of lumbar sympathetic outflow.
option C: systemic infusion of smooth muscle relaxants like sildenafil, which is a PDE 5 inhibitor (increases cGMP), does not cause a decrease in DBP.
option D: systemic infusion of beta-1 adrenergic agonist increases systolic BP and heart rate.",,C,
Q10,which of the following is true regarding paediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation?,"a)chest compression at the rate of 3o:2 with 2 rescuers
b)Adenosine via interosseous is preferred over other methods
c)In chest compression, depth must be at least 1/3rd of the child's chest AP diameter
d)Adrenaline given in dose o.o1 mg/kg iv/io in 1:1ooo concentration","The depth of compressions in infants should be at least 1.5 inches or 1/3 the depth of the infant’s chest.
Effective chest compressions in infants and pediatric population:
• 1oo to 12o compressions per minute (3o compressions for every 15-18 sec).
• one provider: Place two fingers, one between the nipple line and the other 1 cm below the first finger



• Two providers: Encircle the infant's torso with both hands, thumbs pointing cephalad and positioned 1cm below the nipples over the sternum.
• Depth of compressions should be at least 1.5 inches or 1/3 the depth of the infant’s chest.
• Press hard and fast
• Allow for full chest recoil after every compression


other options:
option A: Chest compression at the rate of 3o:2 with 2 rescuers: For children, the
compression-to-ventilation ratio is 15:2 when there are two rescuers. A 3o:2 ratio is used only if there is a single rescuer, similar to adult CPR.
option B: Adenosine via interosseous is preferred over other methods: Adenosine is not used in pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It is used in PSVT treatment in intravenous routes.
option D: Adrenaline given in dose o.o1 mg/kg iv/io in 1:1ooo concentration: Epinephrine is the drug of choice for treating bradycardia in infants and children. The recommended dose is o.o1    mg/ kg of a 1:1o,ooo solution.",,C,3502-2181.PNG
Q11,which of the following must be avoided in post-cardiac arrest resuscitation care?,"a)Maintain MAP over 65
b)Maintain spo2 above 94%
c)Revascularisation procedure if the patient develops sT elevation post-resuscitation
d)Bring the body temperature down to below 32 degrees, therapeutic hypothermia if unresponsive","The body temperature in post cardiac arrest care is to be maintained between 32-36 degrees for at least 24 hours. This is known as targeted temperature managament.
Targeted temperature management (TTM) is the only intervention demonstrated to improve neurological recovery after cardiac arrest and involves maintaining core body temperature     between 32-36°C for at least 24 hours.
This is done in post-cardiac resuscitation patients who have achieved a return of spontaneous circulation (RoSC) but are still comatose.



The entire body is to be cooled using a combination of methods like fluid-filled cooling blankets, ice packs, forced air blankets, cold IV fluids, and/or invasive devices or catheters.
It is the only intervention that can improve neurological recovery after cardiac arrest. It is most beneficial in ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia patients.
cardiac arrest (especially with shockable rhythms) and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy are the primary established indications for therapeutic hypothermia. Stroke (in some cases),
where thrombectomy is not an option, is another indication.


other options:
option A: Maintain MAP over 65: A MAP of ≥ 65 mmHg is the minimum threshold recommended during post-cardiac arrest care to prevent ischemic injury and support organ function.
option B: Maintain Spo2 above 94%: The recommended target Spo■ range in post-cardiac arrest care is 92-98%.
option D: Revascularisation procedure if the patient develops ST elevation post resuscitation:
Post-cardiac arrest patients with STEMI benefit from revascularization, as it reduces mortality and improves cardiac function.",,D,3503-2182.PNG
Q12,Jackson Rees circuit is used in,"a)paediatric anaesthesia
b)cardiac anaesthesia
c)Neuro anaesthesia
d)obstetric anaesthesia","The Jackson Rees circuit is used in paediatric anaesthesia.
Jackson Rees modification ofAyre's T piece is classified as a Mapleson's F system (Semi-closed circuits).
It is used in children &lt;6 years or &lt;2o kgs.





other options:
option B, c, and D: cardiac anaesthesia, Neuro anaesthesia, and obstetric anaesthesia require     closed circuit. They have a provision to absorb co2, using soda lime. closed circuits are used for long periods of procedures.
