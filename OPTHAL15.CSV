Q1,which of the following muscle is responsible for ptosis in horner's syndrome?,"a)Levator palpebrae superioris muscle
b)oribicularis oculi
c)Horner's muscle
d)Muller's muscle","ptosis in Horner's syndrome is due to the paralysis of Muller's muscle. Muller's muscle(superior tarsal muscle) maintains the elevation of the upper eyelid. It is innervated by the sympathetic     nervous system.
Fasanella-servat operation is indicated in cases having mild ptosis(&lt; 2 mm) and good levator function. In this surgery, the upper tarsal border along with its attached Muller’s muscle and
conjunctiva are resected.",3164-1936.PNG,D,
Q2,An 11-year-old presented with the following growth in the eye as shown below. what is the diagnosis?,"a)papilloma
b)Myxoma
c)pyogenic granuloma
d)Limbal dermoid","The image shows the presence of a limbal dermoid.

Limbal Dermoid is a choristoma (a mass of histologically normal tissue in an abnormal location). It consists of collagenous tissue containing dermal elements and covered by stratified squamous   epithelium. Limbal dermoid present in early childhood as a subconjunctival mass in the
infratemporal limbus. Treatment is indicated for chronic irritation, amblyopia, vision impairment and corneal dellen formation. small dermoids can be excised, larger lesions may need lamellar
keratosclerectomy.",3165-1937.PNG,D,
Q3,patient undergoes lens implantation folllowing which there's worsening of vision after 1 year. slit lamp examination finding is shown in the image below. Identify the complication.,"a)posterior subcapsular cataract
b)Bullous keratopathy
c)subluxation of lens
d)corneal opacity","The given clinical vignette supported with the image of vacoulated clusters seen behind IOL is   suggestive of Elschnig’s pearls which is a type of posterior subcapsular cataract (after cataract).
posterior subcapsular cataracts occur mainly due to ageing, other causes include the use of topical steroids, trauma, excessive consumption of alcohol, and exposure to ionizing radiation. visual
impairment is more during the day or exposure to bright light as the pupil constricts which blocks light rays.
After cataract also known as secondary cataract or posterior capsular opacification is a late postoperative complication that follows extracapsular extraction of the lens.
Different types of after cataract include:
• Elschnig’s pearls: where the subcapsular epithelial cells proliferate and develop into vacuolated soap bubble like clusters along the posterior capsule.
• soemmering’s ring: A peripheral dense ring is formed behind the iris and is enclosed between layers of the capsule.
• Dense membranous after cataract: formed in the pupillary area impairing the vision.
• Thin membranous after cataract : is thickened posterior capsule.


Treatment of after cataract is by

• Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy of the posterior capsule which works on the principle of photodisruption
• surgical posterior capsulotomy.",Picture32.png,A,Picture33.png
Q4,Identify the perimetry finding.,"a)Arcuate scotoma
b)Blind spot enlargement
c)Altitudinal defect
d)Roenne nasal step","The perimetry image in the question above shows blind spot enlargement.
Blind spot enlargement is a rare finding in the visual field examination. The most common cause of blind spot enlargement is Idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Blind spot enlargement occurs  due to displacement of the peripapillary retina and refractive changes due to significant optic
nerve head swelling. other common causes of blind spot enlargement are syphilis, west Nile virus, or Rubella vaccination

Q6,A 2o-year-old presented with gradual loss of vision at night and a fundoscopy image is shown. what is the diagnosis?,"a)Retinitis pigmentosa
b)Retinitis punctata albicuns
c)Retinal hemorrhage
d)Fundus flavimaculatus","The fundus shows a pale waxy disc, attenuated arteries, and bony spicules along with gradual loss of vision which implies that it is case of retinitis pigmentosa (RP).
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a dystrophy of rods and cones, with rods being primarily affected. It is a genetic disease. The non-hereditary/sporadic type is most common. Among the hereditary
type, it can occur in an autosomal dominant (AD), autosomal recessive (AR), or X-linked recessive (XLR) pattern. AD disease generally has the best prognosis.
The presenting feature is night blindness.
Investigations:
• Perimetry- the initial stage will have ring scotoma, which further develops into tunnel vision.
• Electroretinography- reveals a decreased amplitude of both ""a"" and ""b"" waves. Atypical types of RP are as follows:
• sectoral RP
• Pericentric/Inverse RP
• RP sine pigmento
• RP punctata albescens

There is no effective treatment for Rp.",2960-1796.PNG,A,
Q7,A 2-month-old girl child was brought to the hospital by her parents with the following presentation. what is the appropriate management?,"a)Immediate surgery
b)wait until 4 months of age
c)wait until 2 years of age
d)Trial of medical therapy","For the 2-month-old girl presenting with leukocoria in the left eye, likely indicative of a congenital infantile cataract, immediate surgery is the most appropriate management.
congenital infantile cataract refers to lens opacities present at birth, which can obstruct vision
and potentially affect the child’s overall development. If left untreated, congenital cataracts,
especially unilateral cataracts, can lead to amblyopia, a condition where one eye fails to develop   normal vision due to insufficient visual input. Immediate surgical intervention is crucial not only to remove the cataract and restore visual clarity but also to minimize the risk of amblyopia,
ensuring the best possible outcomes for the child's visual and developmental health. prompt
diagnosis and treatment can significantly enhance the chances of preserving and improving the child’s vision.
Leukocoria, or the white pupillary reflex or cat's eye reflex, is a critical sign that often indicates     serious underlying eye disorders requiring prompt evaluation and management. common causes of leukocoria include:
• Retinoblastoma
• congenital cataract
• coloboma of the choroid
• persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous
• Toxocara infestation
• coat's exudative retinopathy.
Note: Retinoblastoma, a malignant tumour of the retina, often affects children under 6 years of age and can present with symptoms such as leukocoria, strabismus (crossed eyes), or vision
problems. Treatment options vary widely depending on factors like the tumour's size, location, and whether it is unilateral or bilateral.",Picture26.png,A,
Q8,The following MRI image shows a malignancy. what is the visual field defect observed in this case?,"a)complete blindness
b)Homonymous hemianopia
c)Binasal hemianopia
d)Bitemporal hemianopia","The given MRI shows a tumour protruding out of sella turcica. This is likely to be a pituitary tumour(pituitary macroadenoma) compressing the optic chiasma, resulting in bitemporal
hemianopia.
pituitary macroadenoma can compress the optic chiasm, causing bitemporal hemianopia, which     leads to the loss of vision in the temporal halves of the visual fields in both eyes. This occurs when damage to the middle part of the optic chiasm affects the crossing fibres from the nasal retina of    each eye while the uncrossed fibres from the temporal retinas remain intact. As a result,
individuals retain central vision but lose peripheral vision on the sides. The most common cause ofbitemporal hemianopia is pituitary adenoma. other common causes include suprasellar
aneurysms, chronic arachnoiditis, and suprasellar tumours like craniopharyngioma and

suprasellar meningioma.
Individuals with this condition can see in both left and right central visual fields, with both eyes open. However, all information from the most peripheral parts of visual fields (which are seen    only by the nasal retinas) is lost.
A pituitary adenoma is the most common tumour of the sellar region. Depending on their size they are broadly classified into:
• pituitary microadenoma: &lt; 1 cm in size
• pituitary macroadenoma: &gt; 1 cm in size and usually extending superiorly.
clinical features include bi-temporal hemianopia, headache, and vomiting. skull X-ray finding is ballooning of the sellae. MRI is the investigation of choice. Indentation at the diaphragma sellae gives rise to a snowman/figure of eight appearance, which is seen in the pituitary adenoma as
shown below.


other options:
option A: complete blindness refers to a total lack of vision, which can result from various causes, including severe damage to the eyes themselves (like retinal detachment, severe glaucoma, or
optic nerve damage) or the visual pathways leading to the brain. Individuals who are completely blind have no visual perception at all.
option B: Homonymous hemianopia (HH) involves loss of vision on the same side of the visual
field in both eyes. HH is characteristically seen in lesions involving the visual pathway posterior to the optic chiasma.
option c: Binasal hemianopia is seen in lesions affecting bilateral lateral chiasma where the     temporal fibres of both the retina continue forward without crossing. This affects vision in the nasal quadrants of both eyes.",3178-1946.PNG,D,3178-1946.PNG
Q9,"A 26-year-old teacher presents with a red nodule over her sclera, which resolves with
medications but is recurrent. Identify the condition and what else will you look for in this patient?","a)pingecula; Dry eye
b)Episcleritis; Rheumatoid arthritis
c)pterygium; Astigmatism
d)scleritis; Rheumatoid arthritis","A red nodule on the sclera, as shown in the image, with a history of recurrence, suggests a
diagnosis of nodular episcleritis. It is often associated with systemic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.
Episcleritis is benign, recurrent, inflammation of the episclera, involving the overlying Tenon's     capsule but not the underlying sclera. It is more common in women than in men. It is an allergic reaction to an endogenous toxin. Clinically, two types of presentations may occur:
• Simple episcleritis is characterized by sectorial or diffuse inflammation of the episclera.
• Nodular episcleritis is characterized by a pink or purple flat nodule surrounded by injection,
usually situated 2-3 mm away from the limbus. The nodule is firm, and tender and can be moved separately from the sclera, and the overlying conjunctiva also moves freely.
Management of episcleritis typically includes topical NSAIDs, corticosteroid eye drops, cold compresses, and artificial tears. For recurrent cases, systemic NSAIDs may be required.
2.5% phenylephrine can be used to differentiate episcleritis and scleritis. Since the vessels of the episclera are superficial, they blanch, whereas, in scleritis, the vessels do not blanch.
other options:
option A: pinguecula is a degenerative condition of the conjunctiva, characterized by the
formation of a yellowish-white patch on the bulbar conjunctiva near the limbus. It usually
presents as a triangular patch on the nasal side, with the triangle's apex commonly pointed away from the cornea.


option C: pterygium is a wing-shaped, triangular fibrovascular ingrowth of degenerative
conjunctival tissue that can encroach onto the cornea. It is a response to prolonged exposure to    ultraviolet rays, dry heat, etc. This condition can be treated symptomatically with tear substitutes for dry eye symptoms and patients are advised to avoid ultraviolet rays.



Option D: scleritis refers to an inflammation of the sclera proper. It usually occurs in elderly
patients (4o-7o years) involving females more than males. It is frequently associated with an
underlying systemic inflammatory condition. The patient presents with moderate to severe pain, redness, lacrimation, photophobia, and diminution of vision.",3169-1940.PNG,B,3179-1947.PNG;3158-1932.PNG
Q10,Identify the visual field defect in the given image:,"a)Altitudinal hemianopia
b)complete binasal hemianopia
c)Bitemporal hemianopia
d)Homonymous hemianopia","The visual field defect in the given image is the right homonymous hemianopia.
Right homonymous hemianopia, marked by loss of vision in the right half of the visual field of  both eyes, indicates a lesion in the left optic tract. This occurs because the optic tract transmits visual information from the left nasal retina and right temporal retina, and disruption leads to  right-sided visual field loss.
This condition highlights a post-chiasmal visual pathway issue, primarily affecting the optic tract,  which processes contralateral visual fields. common causes of lesions include pituitary adenomas, craniopharyngiomas, optic thalamus tumours, and aneurysms ofthe superior cerebellar or
posterior cerebral arteries, as well as demyelinating diseases and infarctions.
complete homonymous hemianopia affects the complete visual hemifields of both eyes due to  large lesions posterior to the optic chiasma. In contrast, smaller lesions can cause incomplete   homonymous hemianopia, categorized as congruous or incongruous based on the similarity of defects in each half field. Lesions in the immediate post-chiasmal region often produce
incongruent defects, while more posterior lesions in the occipital cortex result in congruous homonymous hemianopia.
Altitudinal hemianopia is defined as hemianopia affecting the upper or lower half of the visual field. It is most commonly seen in anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION). Also seen in
suprasellar tumors and occipital lobe lesions.",3170-1941.PNG,D,
Q11,"A patient complained of acute painful diminution of vision in the left eye for the past 2 days. on ophthalmic examination, circumcorneal congestion and irregularly shaped pupil were
noted as shown below, with the left eye visual acuity at 6/6o and the right eye at 6/12. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)Angle closure glaucoma
b)Acute anterior uveitis
c)Acute conjunctivitis
d)Episcleritis","Given the patient's symptoms—acute pain, decreased vision in the left eye, circumcorneal
congestion, irregularly shaped pupil and keratic precipitates, as shown in the image—the most likely diagnosis is acute anterior uveitis. This condition, also known as iritis, involves
inflammation of the iris and anterior chamber.
key features of acute anterior uveitis include unilateral eye pain, circumcorneal redness,
photophobia, and reduced visual acuity. The pupil may appear irregular or constricted, and keratic precipitates (kP) on the corneal endothelium are pathognomonic for this condition.
Inflammation leads to pseudo-rubeosis iridis and aqueous flare, a hazy appearance in the anterior chamber due to inflammatory exudate.
Anterior uveitis involves inflammation of the uvea, which can cause sluggish pupillary reactions
and a ""muddy"" appearance of the iris. Aqueous flare is often the earliest sign seen during slit-lamp examination, alongside koeppe and Busacca nodules and potential posterior synechiae formation.
Management focuses on reducing inflammation and managing symptoms, typically using topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics like homatropine or atropine to relieve pain and prevent
synechiae. Monitoring intraocular pressure is also essential, as cycloplegics are contraindicated in angle-closure glaucoma due to the risk of exacerbating the condition.
other options:
option A: Angle-closure glaucoma involves a sudden increase in intraocular pressure due to
blockage of the anterior chamber angle. It is characterized by severe eye pain, blurred vision, and  a mid-dilated pupil, with diffuse redness rather than the circumcorneal congestion seen in uveitis.
option C: Acute conjunctivitis typically presents with diffuse redness, discharge, and mild irritation, without significant pupil changes or severe vision loss.
option D: Episcleritis features sectoral or diffuse redness with mild tenderness but does not cause severe pain, irregular pupil, or substantial visual changes seen in anterior uveitis.",3171-1943.PNG,B,
Q12,"A patient who was watching a movie suddenly developed acute pain in the eye and
diminution in vision. He was brought to the emergency department and on examination, a shallow anterior chamber was noted. what would be the appropriate management for this condition?","a)IV Mannitol + atropine e/d
b)IV Mannitol + pilocarpine e/d
c)IV Mannitol+ methyl cellulose e/d
d)IV Mannitol+ moxifloxacin e/d","The given clinical scenario, supported by the image of the mid-dilated pupil, with a shallow
anterior chamber (AC), is suggestive of acute angle-closure glaucoma and the appropriate
management for this patient includes intravenous mannitol and topical medications like
pilocarpine, which is given to reduce the IoP, and constrict the pupil and help relieve the acute angle closure attack.
The primary goal in managing Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma (PACG) is to prevent optic nerve damage by reducing IoP. In acute attacks, treatment involves aggressively lowering IoP using
intravenous mannitol and oral acetazolamide to quickly control symptoms. Topical medications   such as pilocarpine, beta-blockers, cholinergic agents, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are also used to address the acute episode.
once the immediate crisis is managed, YAG laser iridotomy (YAG PI) is performed to create an
alternate drainage pathway for the aqueous humor, both in the affected eye and the fellow eye.
For ongoing management, patients with PACG may require glaucoma medications to maintain
target IoP. In cases where maximal medical therapy fails, surgical options such as trabeculectomy

or glaucoma drainage devices may be necessary, particularly if there is progressive visual field loss or non-compliance with treatment. Cyclodestructive procedures may be considered for patients
with a painful, blind eye or those with recurrent surgical failures.
Acute primary angle-closure glaucoma refers to the occlusion ofthe trabecular meshwork by the peripheral iris (iridotrabecular contact [ITC]), obstructing aqueous outflow.
Angle closure can be primary when it occurs in an anatomically predisposed eye or secondary to another ocular or systemic factor.
Classification:
Symptoms: Pain, redness, photophobia, impaired vision, watering Signs:
• Corneal edema- coloured halos
• Conjunctiva- congestion, chemosis

Q13,Identify the defect shown in the image:,"a)Herbert pits
b)Horner tranta spots
c)Gelatinous papillae
d)pannus","The image shows tiny lesions at the limbus, indicating Hebert's pits. This finding is seen in
trachoma, which is caused by chlamydia trachomatis, more specifically the trachoma inclusion conjunctivitis (TRIc) serovars A, B, Ba, c.
Trachoma is a form of chronic infective conjunctivitis and is one of the leading causes of blindness. It has an  active  inflammatory stage and a  cicatricial  chronic stage.
The active inflammatory stage is more prevalent in children and presents with nonspecific
symptoms of ocular irritation, foreign body sensation, and discharge (often mild symptoms). Examination findings at this stage show:
conjunctival follicles contain Leber cells (multinucleated lymphocytes)
corneal Herbert's follicles (similar to conjunctival follicles)
cicatricial chronic stage is seen in middle age. And when the chronic infection with sequelae sets  in, the patient complains of pain, lacrimation, photophobia, and later blurring, and finally loss of vision. conjunctiva shows concretions (whitish deposits of inspissated mucus in depressions
called glands of Henle). corneal signs include:
Herbert pits (pitted scars in the limbal which are remnants of healed Herbert follicles)
corneal opacity is seen in later stages.
There can be associated trichiasis ( when at least one eyelash rubs the eyeball) and entropion. At present WHO grading with 'FISTO' is in use.
Trachoma is treated according to the WHO classification using the SAFE strategy (Surgery,
Antibiotics, Facial hygiene, and Environmental improvement). Azithromycin is the antibiotic of choice, and surgery involves the correction of trichiasis and entropion. In case of significant
corneal scarring, penetrating keratoplasty is done.
Other options:
Option B: Horner  Trantas dots (image below) are distinct white, chalky, gelatinous nodules made up of eosinophils and epithelial debris that appear at the limbus, and they are characteristic of
limbal vernal keratoconjunctivitis (vkc).


option C: In giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), gelatinous papillae initially appear as small,
elevated nodules on the conjunctiva. These papillae eventually grow larger, forming macropapillae and giant papillae, and may be accompanied by Trantas dots at the limbus.
The image below shows giant papillae in the conjunctiva:


option D: Progressive pannus in trachoma involves the infiltration of the cornea with new blood vessels developing in the upper part, lying between the epithelium and Bowman's membrane. As the condition advances, these superficial vessels contribute to the destruction of Bowman's
membrane, with corneal infiltration occurring before significant vascularization.",3172-1944.PNG,A,3183-1948.PNG;3055-1863.PNG;3184-1949.PNG
Q14,"A patient wearing contact lenses develops pain in the orbital region. He has had a very casual attitude towards cleaning his contact lenses. He presented with corneal ulcer and keratitis.
scrapings showed an organism with a spine-like pseudopodia. which organism is the likely cause of this patient's symptoms?","a)Balamuthia
b)Acanthamoeba
c)Naegleria fowleri
d)staphylococcus aureus","The given clinical history of orbital pain in a contact lens wearer and the demonstration of corneal ulcer and keratitis with scrapings showing an organism with spine-like pseudopodia suggest
Acanthamoeba keratitis and the organism implicated in causing this patient's condition is
Acanthamoeba.
Acanthamoeba exists as an active trophozoite form and a resistant cystic form, both of which are   infective. The large, 2o–5o μm trophozoite form is distinguished by spine-like pseudopodia called acanthopodia. Human beings acquire infection by inhalation of cysts or trophozoites, ingestion of cysts or through traumatized skin or eyes. Following inhalation, the trophozoites reach the lungs   and invade the central nervous system through the bloodstream, producing granulomatous
amebic encephalitis (GAE). It presents chiefly as two chronic conditions: (1) keratitis and (2) encephalitis.
Acanthamoeba keratitis is an infection of the eyes that typically develops from the entry of the amebic cyst through abrasions on the cornea. Most of the cases are associated with the use of  contact lenses and individuals who swim or bathe in contaminated water.
patients usually present with photophobia, excessive tearing, redness, and foreign body sensation, which can be bilateral in contact lens users. pain is disproportionate to the degree of keratitis due  to perineural invasion. It presents as a ring lesion or ring stromal infiltrate as shown below.


Diagnosis of amoebic keratitis is made by the demonstration of the cyst in corneal scrapings by wet mount, histology, and culture. The cysts are smaller (12-25 micrometres) and polygonal or   star-shaped.
Topical administration ofbiguanides or chlorhexidine with or without diamidine agents can be
used for the management of acanthamoeba keratitis. In severe cases penetrating keratoplasty can be done.

spine like pseudopodia of acanthamoeba:


other options:
option A: Balamuthia is a leptomixid free-living amoeba, reported to cause GAE. It exists in the ameboid trophozoite stage and is not associated with acanthopodia as seen in Acanthamoeba
species.
option C: The electron microscopy image of the infective form of Naegleria fowleri shows rounded pseudopodia called lobopodia. The infection usually follows swimming in freshwater rivers or
ponds. The amoebae invade the nasal mucosa and pass through the olfactory nerve branches in the cribriform plate into the meninges. It is mainly associated with primary amoebic
meningoencephalitis. The disease advances rapidly, causing fever, headache, vomiting, stiff neck, ataxia, seizure and coma.



option D: staphylococcus aureus is a common bacterium(not associated with spine-like
pseudopodia), that can cause phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis, characterized by eye redness,    pain, and the development of a white-pinkish nodule on the conjunctiva. This condition results from a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the bacterial proteins.",,B,3185-1950.PNG;3186-1952.PNG;3186-1951.PNG;3187-1953.PNG
