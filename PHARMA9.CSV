Question 1,which of the following is false about the selection of essential drugs?,"a) Adequate safety profile needs to be established
b) cost to benefit has to be considered
c) Fixed drug combination is preferred over single drugs
d) Disease prevalence is considered","Fixed drug combinations are not preferred over single drugs while selecting essential drugs.
criteria for selection of essential medicines as per WHO:
• There should be adequate data on the safety and efficacy of the drug.
• The drug should be available in a form where its quality including bioavailability and stability on storage is assured.
• The choice of the drug depends on the pattern of prevalent diseases, financial resources, availability of trained personnel and facilities, genetic, demographic, and environmental factors.
• The cost-benefit ratio is an important factor.
• pharmacokinetic properties of the drug and the local manufacture and storage facilities are also considered.
• Essential drugs should preferably be single compounds.
• Fixed combinations are used only when the dosage of each component meets the requirement of the population in which it is used. It should also have the advantage in safety, therapeutic effect, adherence, and prevention of drug resistance when compared to single compounds.
• The selection of essential drugs is a continuous process and changes are to be made with developments in public health and the availability of better drugs.
• The selection should be based on rationally developed treatment guidelines.
Note:
In 1977 WHO brought the first ""Model List of Essential Drugs"". India made its ""National Essential Drug List"" in 1996 and revised the list in 2011 and renamed it as ""National List of Essential Medicines"". The latest edition of WHO Model List of Essential Drugs is the 21st edition published in 2019.",,C,
Question 2,"A 34-year-old man with hypertension is diagnosed with stage 4 chronic kidney disease, with eGFR of <3o. His doctor wants to prescribe a thiazide diuretic. which of the following can be given?","a) chlorothiazide
b) chlorthalidone
c) Metolazone
d) Hydrochlorothiazide","The thiazide diuretic that can be used as an antihypertensive in this patient with chronic kidney disease is metolazone.
In patients with chronic renal failure, thiazide diuretics are ineffective. But metolazone, despite being a thiazide diuretic, is effective as antihypertensives in patients with chronic renal failure. Metolazone is useful even in severe renal failure (GFR of ~15 mL/min). It has an additive action when combined with loop diuretics like furosemide. It also has an additional proximal tubular action (thiazides mainly act on DCT). It is commonly used for edema and is occasionally used as an antihypertensive.
Diuretics in hypertension:
Thiazides are the diuretics of choice for uncomplicated hypertension.
Mechanisms of antihypertensive action:
• Decreases plasma and ECF volume by diuresis thereby decreasing cardiac output
• Even when the compensatory mechanisms restore the Na+ levels and plasma volume, a low BP is maintained by a reduction in total peripheral resistance.
• This reduction in total peripheral resistance is due to the persistence of a small sodium and volume deficit even after compensation. The decreased intracellular sodium is responsible for increased compliance of the vessel wall and a reduced response to constrictor stimulus.
Advantages of thiazide as an antihypertensive:
• It can be given as once a day dose and has a flat dose-response curve.
• Decreased incidence of postural hypotension and relative freedom from CNS side effects
• No tolerance
• No fluid retention
• Decreased risk of osteoporotic fractures due to its hypocalciuric action
• Low cost
• Effectiveness in isolated systolic hypertension
Thiazides are ineffective both as antihypertensive and diuretic in patients with chronic renal failure.
High ceiling diuretics: Furosemide is the prototype drug in this class and it is a weaker antihypertensive agent than thiazides. They are given in hypertension only in the presence of the following complications:
• Chronic renal failure - As thiazides are ineffective
• Coexisting refractory congestive heart failure
• Resistance to combination regimen with thiazides
• Marked fluid retention with the use of potent vasodilators.
potassium-sparing diuretics - They are only used in combination with thiazides to prevent the loss of potassium.
side effects of diuretics include hypokalemia, carbohydrate intolerance, dyslipidemia, and hyperuricemia.",,C,
Question 3,A patient who was diagnosed with epilepsy was put on retigabine TDs. Now phenytoin is being added. which of the following changes should be made to retigabine?,"a) Increase the dose
b) Decrease the dose
c) stop the drug
d) stop retigabine and start on carbamazepine","The dose of retigabine should be increased when phenytoin is added because phenytoin can decrease the plasma concentration of retigabine when given together.
Retigabine is also known as ezogabine. Metabolism of the drug occurs by glucuronidation and acetylation. Its half-life is about 7-11 hours and hence requires thrice-daily dosing. when it is administered with phenytoin or carbamazepine there may be a reduction in the plasma concentration of the drug. so the dose of retigabine should be increased when given along with these drugs.
It is a potassium(K+) channel opener that enhancer transmembrane potassium currents mediated by the KNCQ family of ion channels. It was approved as an adjunctive agent for focal onset seizures of patients above 18 years. But because of its adverse effects like retinal abnormalities and blue pigmentation, the production of the drug was discontinued by the manufacturer.
other drug interactions of phenytoin:
It is an inducer of the enzymes Cyp2C8/9, Cyp3A4/5, and other Cyps. It is also an inhibitor of Cyp2C9/19.
• phenobarbitone can inhibit the metabolism of phenytoin. But the overall interaction is unpredictable as both the drug enhance each other's degradation by enzyme induction.
• phenytoin and carbamazepine induce each other's metabolism.
• valproate increases the level of unbound phenytoin by displacing the protein-bound form and decreasing its metabolism.
• phenytoin increases the metabolism of steroids, oral contraceptives, doxycycline, theophylline, etc by enzyme induction.
• It produces competitive inhibition of warfarin metabolism. (Increased risk of bleeding when given together)
• Drugs like chloramphenicol, warfarin, isoniazid, and cimetidine can inhibit the metabolism of phenytoin and cause its toxicity.
• sucralfate decreases the absorption of phenytoin by binding to it in the gastrointestinal tract.",,A,
Question 4,"A patient with history of ischemic stroke was started on clopidogrel. However, she had another attack of stroke after 6 months. which of the following is likely to be responsible for the failure of clopidogrel in this patient?","a) Downregulation of Cyp2C19
b) Downregulation of Cyp2D6
c) upregulation of Cyp1A1
d) Downregulation of Cyp2E1","Downregulation of cyp2c19 is responsible for the failure of clopidogrel in this patient.
clopidogrel is a prodrug and its metabolic activation occurs in the liver. It is bioactivated by the cyp2c19 enzyme. If there is downregulation of this enzyme it will cause a decrease in the efficacy of clopidogrel and can lead to thrombotic events like stroke. Drugs that inhibit cyp2c19 can also decrease the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel. proton-pump inhibitors may cause inhibition of cyp2c19 and when they are given in combination there would be a decrease in the efficacy of clopidogrel.
Therapeutic uses: clopidogrel is used to reduce the rate of stroke and myocardial infarction. It also decreases the rate of deaths in patients with recent myocardial infarction or stroke. other uses are acute coronary syndrome and peripheral arterial disease.
Adverse effects: Increased risk of bleeding especially when given with an anticoagulant or aspirin. Rarely thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura can occur.
cyp2c19: common drugs that are metabolized include omeprazole, phenytoin, diazepam, and propanolol. Inducers ofthe cyp2c subfamily are rifampicin and carbamazepine. omeprazole is an inhibitor.
other options:
cyp2D6: Drugs metabolized include SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, antiarrhythmic drugs, beta-blockers, and opiates. It is inhibited by quinidine and it will prevent the formation of morphine from codeine. Hence quinidine decreases the analgesic effect of codeine.
cyp1A1/2: It metabolizes few drugs like theophylline, paracetamol, caffeine and carbamazepine. It plays an important role in the activation of procarcinogens. Inducers are rifampicin, carbamazepine, polycyclic hydrocarbons, charbroiled meat, and cigarette smoke.
cyp2E1: It is involved in the oxidation of alcohol, halothane, and minor metabolism of other drugs. It is important to note that it is involved in the formation of hepatotoxic N-acetyl benzoquinone imine from paracetamol. chronic alcoholism is responsible for the induction of this enzyme.",,A,
Question 5,which of the following can be given for long term management of obesity?,"a) Liraglutide
b) Metformin
c) sibutramine
d) Fenfluramine","Liraglutide is used in the long-term management of obesity.
Mechanism of action:
• Increase glucose-mediated insulin release
• Lowers the glucagon levels
• Delays gastric emptying
• Decreases feeding by stimulating GLp-1 receptors in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.
It is a GLp-1 analog used as a parenteral hypoglycemic agent and anti-obesity drug. It is administered subcutaneously. It is used as an adjuvant in patients who are not achieving glycemic control with oral agents. It can be also added with basal insulin.
It is found to decrease the risk of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
Adverse effects: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. It should not be given in patients with a personal or family history of MEN syndrome or medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.
Other options:
Metformin: It belongs to the biguanides class of oral hypoglycemic agents. It is used as a first-line agent in the management of type 2 diabetes and it acts by reducing hepatic glucose production. It is also used to treat infertility in pCOD patients. IT is usually not associated with weight gain and in some cases, it may cause mild weight reduction.
sibutramine: It has both serotonergic and noradrenergic action. It is also an anorectic agent with a similar mechanism of action to fenfluramine. But due to severe adverse effects, Us-FDA has banned its use.
Fenfluramine: It is a serotonergic anorectic agent. It reduces food-seeking behavior due to increased serotonergic transmission in the hypothalamus. The use of is not recommended now by the Us-FDA due to its severe side effects.",,A,
Question 6,"An HIV-positive woman on ART was prescribed ergotamine for a migraine attack 4 days back. she presented with complaints that she is unable to feel her legs from the mid-thigh to her toes, for the past two days. The angiography image is given below. what is the likely diagnosis?","a) Atherosclerosis
b) Ergotism
c) polyradicular neuropathy
d) Herniated disc","The clinical features and the CT angiography image showing diffuse symmetrical luminal narrowing of the lower limb vessels are suggestive of ergotism.
In this case, a patient on antiretroviral therapy is given ergotamine. HIV protease inhibitors used in ART like ritonavir, lopinavir, etc are potent inhibitors of the Cyp3A4 enzyme. This enzyme is responsible for the metabolism of ergot compounds. Hence inhibition of this enzyme leads to decreased metabolism of ergotamine. This causes the accumulation of toxic levels of ergotamine in the patient and leads to ergotism.
Ergotamine is a partial agonist and antagonist at alpha-adrenergic, 5HT1; and 5HT2 receptors. It produces sustained vasoconstriction, vasomotor center depression, and visceral smooth muscle contraction.
Adverse effects: Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain may be seen. Vasoconstriction caused by the drug is responsible for most of the adverse effects. These are usually seen with long-term therapy with higher doses.
• It may precipitate or aggravate angina pectoris or myocardial infarction due to coronary insufficiency.
• some patients develop cold, numb, and painful extremities.
• Leg claudication may be seen
• Gangrene of the extremities
Contraindications for ergotamine:
• peripheral vascular disease
• Coronary artery disease
• Uncontrolled hypertension
• sepsis
• pregnancy
• Liver and kidney diseases",1111-755.PNG,B,IMAGE Q
Question 7,Topiramate is used for,"a) Treatment of migrane
b) Treatment of Lennox Gastaut syndrome
c) prophylaxis of ADHD
d) Treatment of dementia","Topiramate is used in the treatment of Lennox-Gastuat syndrome.
uses of topiramate:
• In newly diagnosed focal and primary generalized epilepsy in adults and children
• As monotherapy for refractory focal epilepsy and generalized tonic-clonic seizures
• Treatment of tonic-clonic seizures in patients with Lennox-Gastuat syndrome
• It is also used in the prophylaxis of migraine(not for treatment)
• It can be given as monotherapy for children of 1o years or more. But if used as adjunctive therapy it can be used in children as young as 2 years.
Mechanism of action: It reduces voltage-gated sodium currents in the cerebellar granule cells. It also activates a hyperpolarizing potassium current, enhances GABAA receptor currents, and limits the activation of the AMpA-kainate subtype of glutamate receptors. It also produces weak inhibition of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme.
pharmacokinetics: only 1o-2o% is bound to plasma proteins and the drug is largely excreted unchanged in the urine. Half-life is about 1 day. Topiramate is found to decrease the plasma concentrations of oral contraceptives, hence a higher dose of ocps should be given along with topiramate.
Adverse effects:
• somnolence, weight loss, fatigue, and nervousness are commonly seen
• It can precipitate renal calculi. It may be due to the weak carbonic anhydrase inhibition.
• cognitive impairment",,B,
Question 8,which of the following is incorrectly matched?,"a) Andexanet alfa: Edoxaban
b) Andexanet alfa: Rivaroxaban
c) Idarucizumab : Dabigatran
d) ciraparantag: Fondaparinux","ciraparantag is a reversal agent for all direct anticoagulants and is not useful with fondaparinux which is an indirect factor xa inhibitor.
ciraparantag, andexanet alfa, and idarucizumab are all reversal agents of direct anticoagulants.
ciraparantag: It is considered as a potential reversal agent against all direct anticoagulants including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, apixaban, LMWH, and heparin. This drug is in the early stages of development.
Andexanet alfa: It is a recombinant analog of factor xa and is proposed for reversal of oral factor xa inhibitors like rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban. It rapidly reverses the action of these drugs and restores thrombin generation.
Idarucizumab: It is a licensed monoclonal antibody that specifically acts as a reversal agent for dabigatran. It has a 350 times higher affinity for dabigatran than thrombin. Hence it forms a complex with dabigatran and is excreted by the kidneys.
If a patient on direct oral anticoagulants like dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban presents with life-threatening bleeds and the reversal agents are not available then other options are the administration of prothrombin complex concentrate, activated prothrombin complex concentrate, or recombinant factor VII-A. Hemodialysis is useful in severe bleeding due to dabigatran.
Other reversal agents for anticoagulants:
• Protamine sulphate - Heparin
• Vitamin K - warfarin
Note:
Andexanet alfa has received Us-FDA approval in May 2018 as a reversal agent for rivaroxaban and apixaban.",,D,
Question 9,Inhaled Nitric oxide is approved for treatment of,"a) Labile hypertension
b) pulmonary hypertension
c) Treatment of resistant migraine
d) Resistant parkinsonls disease","Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) is used in the management of pulmonary hypertension.
The only FDA-approved therapeutic indication of inhaled nitric oxide is in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. It has the ability to selectively dilate pulmonary vasculature. Hence it can be used in conditions with increased pulmonary vascular resistance.
It is proposed for the:
• Long-term management of pulmonary artery hypertension(PAH) and other forms of pulmonary hypertension
• Rescue therapy for severely hypoxemic patients with or without pulmonary hypertension Diagnostic indications:
• In heart failure patients and infants with congenital heart disease during cardiac catheterization to evaluate pulmonary vasoreactivity.
• In determining the diffusion capacity across the alveolar-capillary unit. It is considered superior to carbon dioxide in this because it has a greater affinity for hemoglobin and higher water solubility at body temperature.
Mechanism of action:
It activates soluble guanylyl cyclase and produces cGMP, which then activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase. This leads to the activation of multiple regulatory mechanisms that decrease intracellular calcium and cause vasodilation in precapillary resistance arterioles.
Adverse effects:
• Methemoglobinemia at higher concentrations.
• It can worsen left ventricular performance in patients with an already impaired left ventricular function.",,B,
Question 10,Nivolumab is used as a checkpoint inhibitor in,"a) Retinoblastoma
b) Medulloblastoma
c) pleuropulmonary blastoma
d) Hodgkin's lymphoma","Nivolumab is used as a checkpoint inhibitor in Hodgkin's lymphoma.
FDA approved uses of nivolumab:
• Advanced melanoma
• Advanced non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) that are previously treated
• Renal cell carcinoma
• Advanced head and neck cancers
• Refractory/relapsed classical Hodgkin's lymphoma
Nivolumab is a checkpoint inhibitor that blocks the interaction between pD-1 and its ligands. It is a fully human monoclonal IgG4 antibody. It has a good response rate in patients with pretreated solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Similar effectiveness is also seen with pembrolizumab which is also an anti-pD-1 monoclonal antibody.
Adverse effects:
• In melanoma patients rash is a commonly seen side effect
• fatigue, dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain, cough, decreased appetite, and constipation can be seen in advanced squamous NSCLC patients
• pneumonitis, colitis, nephritis, hepatitis, and renal dysfunction are also seen
Important note:
The FDA on May 2021 has approved the use of nivolumab in patients having completely resected esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancers with residual pathologic disease who have received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.",,D,
Question 11,paradoxical bronchoconstriction seen with ipratropium bromide is due to all except,"a) Hypertonic saline
b) EDTA
c) Benzalkonium chloride
d) prejunctional M2 receptor blockade","paradoxical bronchoconstriction with ipratropium bromide is seen with a hypotonic nebulizer solution and not hypertonic saline.
paradoxical bronchoconstriction with ipratropium bromide is seen especially when given by a nebulizer and may be due to the following factors:
• Hypotonic nebulizer solution
• Antibacterial additives like benzalkonium chloride and EDTA
• It may be also due to prejunctional M2 receptor blockade on the cholinergic nerves present in the airway. These prejunctional M2 receptors normally inhibit acetylcholine release into the synapse. So their blockade can cause increased Ach release and bronchoconstriction.
paradoxical bronchoconstriction is not reported with tiotropium bromide or any other long-acting muscarinic antagonists. Tiotropium is selective for M3 and M1 receptors and therefore less likely to produce prejunctional M2 receptor blockade.
other adverse effects of inhaled muscarinic antagonists:
• A bitter taste is seen with ipratropium
• Nebulization with ipratropium bromide may precipitate glaucoma in elderly patients. This is due to the direct effect of the drug on the eyes and can be easily prevented by using a mouthpiece instead of a facemask.
• Long-acting agents can cause dryness of the mouth.
• In elderly patients, urinary retention may be seen occasionally.",,A,
Question 12,Antimicrobial combinations are used in all except,"a) Gonorrhea
b) Tuberculosis
c) Intra abdominal infections
d) Malaria","Gonorrhea is not managed by antimicrobial combinations. According to the latest CDC guidelines, single-agent therapy with ceftriaxone is the preferred treatment for gonococcal infections.
single-dose of 5oomg intramuscular(IM) ceftriaxone is given for gonorrhea. It is important to note that the previous guidelines that recommended dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin are no longer preferred.
Monotherapy with ceftriaxone is given when concurrent chlamydia infection is ruled out by molecular testing. If this is not done then presumptive treatment for chlamydia should be given along with the treatment of gonorrhea. According to CDC guidelines, 1oomg doxycycline twice daily for 7 days is given as presumptive treatment of chlamydia in nonpregnant individuals.
other options:
Tuberculosis: Multidrug therapy is given in tuberculosis for proper cure and to prevent the selection of drug-resistant mutants. ATT regimen is given in detail in the pearl attached.
Intraabdominal infections: It is usually polymicrobial and can result in an intraabdominal abscess or secondary peritonitis. These are managed with either single-agent or combination therapy.
Broad-spectrum agents with gram-negative cover such as meropenem or piperacillin-tazobactam can be used alone. Combination therapy with metronidazole and other agents like ciprofloxacin, cefepime, etc are used as empirical agents in intraabdominal infections.
Malaria: It is also treated with antimicrobial combinations. In plasmodium vivax and ovale malaria, schizontocides like chloroquine are combined with agents that attack the hypnozoites like primaquine for radical cure. primaquine is also given in combination with Artemisinin combined therapy(ACT) for plasmodium falciparum infections as a gametocidal agent. Treatment regimens are given in the pearl attached.",,A,
Question 13,which of the following steps does vancomycin act on?,"a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4","vancomycin acts on step 4 in the given image.
Mechanism of action of vancomycin: It is a cell wall synthesis inhibitor. It binds to the D-Ala-D-Ala terminus of the newly formed peptidoglycan pentapeptide and inhibits the transglycosylase enzyme. This would prevent further elongation of the peptidoglycan and its cross-linking.
vancomycin is a bactericidal agent for gram-positive organisms. It is also active against many gram-positive anaerobes like clostridium difficile. Resistance against vancomycin in enterococci is due to the alternation in its binding site where D-Ala is replaced by D-Lactate.
clinical uses:
• Parenteral vancomycin is given for bloodstream infections and endocarditis caused by MRSA.
• vancomycin plus gentamicin is given as an alternative regimen for enterococcal endocarditis with penicillin allergy.
• In combination with other agents for suspected meningitis or meningitis due to penicillin-resistant pneumococcus.
• oral vancomycin is given for clostridium difficile colitis.
Adverse effects:
• Injection site phlebitis
• Nephrotoxicity
• ""Redman"" syndrome due to histamine release following infusion
other options:
Fosfomycin inhibits step 1 in the image. It acts at a very early stage in cell wall synthesis and inhibits the cytoplasmic enzyme enol pyruvate transferase. This would block the addition of phosphoenolpyruvate to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. This prevents the formation of UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid which is the precursor N-acetylmuramic acid. N-acetylmuramic acid is a component of the bacterial cell wall and hence cell wall synthesis is inhibited.
cycloserine inhibits step 2 in the image. It is a structural analog of D-alanine and inhibits the enzymes alanine racemase that converts L-alanine to D-alanine and d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase. This would thereby inhibit the incorporation of D-alanine into the peptidoglycan pentapeptide. It is mainly used in the management of tuberculosis where there is resistance to the first-line agents.
Bacitracin inhibits step 3 in the image. It is a cell wall synthesis inhibitor that interferes with dephosphorylation in the cycling of the lipid carrier which transfers peptidoglycan subunits to the growing cell wall. It is only given for topical application because of its severe nephrotoxicity when given systemically.
Note:
Beta-lactam antibiotics prevent cross-linking by inhibiting the transpeptidases. (Last step in the images)",1113-756.PNG,D,IMAGE Q
Question 14,"what would happen to the half-life and plasma concentration of a drug which follows first-order kinetics, if the dose is doubled?","a) Half-life doubles and plasma concentration remains the same
b) Half-life remains the same and plasma concentration doubles
c) Half-life and plasma concentration remains the same
d) Half life and plasma concentration doubles","In this case, the half-life remains the same, and the plasma concentration doubles.
Half-life is constant in drugs following first-order kinetics irrespective of the dose as a constant fraction of the drug is eliminated per unit time.
The plasma concentration of the drug increases when the dose given is increased. In this case, as the drug dose is doubled plasma concentration is also doubled.",,B,
Question 15,which of the following is not an off-label use of risperidone?,"a) OCD
b) Dementia
c) PTSD
d) Bipolar disorder","Risperidone is FDA approved for the treatment of bipolar affective disorders.
uses of risperidone:
• Long-term management of psychosis and schizophrenia.
• Maintenance therapy in mania bipolar disorders.
• Management of irritability associated with autism.
off-label uses of risperidone:
• Management of psychotic symptoms in delirium and dementia.
• obsessive-compulsive disorders.
• post-traumatic stress disorders.
Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that shows both D2 and 5 HT2 receptor blockade. It also has an affinity for alpha 1, alpha 2, and H1 receptors. It produces a more potent D2 blockade than clozapine. Hyperprolactinemia is an important adverse effect. It is also associated with an increased risk of stroke in elderly patients. At low doses, extrapyramidal side effects are less.",,D,
Question 16,The elimination rate constant of a drug is o.o5/hr. what is its half-life?,"a) 2o.8 hours
b) 6.9 hours
c) 13.8 hours
d) 9.8 hours","The half-life of the given drug is 13.8 hours.
The half-life of a drug or t1/2 is the time taken for the plasma concentration to be reduced by 5o%. The elimination rate constant or k value of a drug reflects the fraction of drug removed from the body compartment per unit of time.
The half-life of a drug and its elimination rate constant are inversely proportional to each other. They are represented by the equation:
k t1/2 〓 o.693
Therefore, t1/2 〓 o.693/ k
The given value for elimination rate constant ■ is o.o5, therefore the half-life of the given drug would be:
o.693/ o.o5 〓 13.8
Therefore, the half-life of the drug would be 13.8 hours.",,C,
Question 17,A patient is on phenytoin for a seizure disorder. He was prescribed sucralfate 4 times a day for peptic ulcers. what should be the minimum duration of time between consumption of these drugs?,"a) 3o minutes
b) 6o minutes
c) 9o minutes
d) 12o minutes","The minimum duration of time between the consumption of phenytoin and sucralfate should be 12o minutes.
sucralfate, in an acidic environment (pH < 4) acts by producing a viscous, sticky polymer that adheres to ulcer craters and epithelial cells for up to 6 hours after a single dose. This viscous layer produced in the stomach leads to inhibition of absorption of other drugs, like phenytoin, digoxin, cimetidine, ketoconazole, and fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Therefore, sucralfate should be taken after a gap of at least 2 hours / 12o minutes after the administration of phenytoin.
constipation is the most common side effect of sucralfate. It should be avoided in patients with renal failure who are at risk of aluminium overload. Aluminum-containing antacids should not be combined with sucralfate in these patients. As the viscous gel produced by sucralfate is sticky, it may eventually lead to bezoar formation.
It is generally used for prophylaxis of peptic ulcers, but rarely so because of its side effects and its risks outweigh its benefits.",,D,
Question 18,"category A, B, c, D, X in drug classification are indicative of which of the following?","a) safety in pregnancy
b) Dose adjustment in renal failure
c) cost ratio from cheap to expensive
d) As per safety or therapeutic index","category A, B, c, D, X in drug classification are indicative of their safety in pregnancy.
The united states food and drug administration (FDA) system for teratogenic potential attempts to quantify teratogenic risk from category A (safe) to category X (definite human teratogenic risk). category A: The possibility of fetal harm is remote and studies in women have failed to demonstrate any evidence of risk to the fetus. Examples: doxylamine, folic acid, levothyroxine.
category B: Either animal-reproduction studies have not demonstrated a fetal risk, but there are no controlled studies in pregnant women, or animal-reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect that was not confirmed in controlled studies in pregnant women. Example: Amoxicillin, loratadine, ondansetron.
category c: Either studies in animals have revealed adverse effects on the fetus, that is, teratogenic or embryocidal but there are no controlled studies in women, or studies in women and animals are not available. These drugs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Example: fluconazole, metoprolol, sertraline.
category D: Though there is evidence of human fetal risk, the benefits from use in pregnant women may be acceptable despite the risk, for example, if the drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or for a disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective. Example: lisinopril, lithium, phenytoin.
category X: There is evidence of fetal risk based on human or animal experience and the risk of the use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweighs any possible benefit. The drug is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Example: methotrexate, simvastatin, warfarin.",,A,
Question 19,Identify the false statement regarding suicidal inhibition.,"a) The inhibitor can bind with any site resulting in suicidal inhibition
b) The binding of the enzyme to the substrate analogue is irreversible
c) They are enzyme specific and used in rational drug design
d) The inhibitor forms a product with the enzyme and the product inhibits it","The false statement regarding suicidal inhibition is the inhibitor can bind with any site resulting in suicidal inhibition.
In suicidal inhibition, the inhibitor can only bind with the active site of an enzyme and is unreactive outside the confines of the enzyme's active site.
The enzyme inhibition helps to modify the rate of reactions it catalyzes and this inhibition can either be reversible or irreversible. Reversible inhibitors bind to enzymes through non-covalent bonds. Irreversible inhibitors usually bind to an enzyme through covalent bonds and do so strongly so that it can no longer dissociate.
suicide inhibitors are a category of irreversible inhibitors also called mechanism-based inhibitors. They are specialized substrate analogs that contain a chemical group that reacts with the catalytic machinery of the target enzyme. In these types of inhibitors, the substrate analog irreversibly ties up with the binding site of an enzyme, deceiving the enzyme by concealing its functional group resulting in the formation of a highly reactive molecule, which brings about self-inactivation of the enzyme.
suicide inhibitors bind to the enzyme by means of covalent bonds; they are enzyme-specific and unreactive outside the confines of the enzyme’s active site.
An example of this would be the binding of clavulanic acid to the active site of beta-lactamases in bacteria. clavulanic acid mimics the structure of a beta-lactam antibiotic and forms a covalent adduct with the β-lactamase active site. This leads to a rearrangement that creates a much more reactive derivative, which is subsequently attacked in its active site to irreversibly acylate the enzyme and inactivate it. Thus, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid are combined to overcome bacterial resistance to amoxicillin alone.
The development of clavulanic acid to target beta-lactamase-producing bacteria is also an example of the rational design of drugs. Rational design of drugs refers to the ability to predict the appropriate molecular structure of a drug on the basis of information about its biological receptor.",,A,
Question 20,The dose at which dopamine acts on beta 1 receptors is ____.,"a) 2-1o mcg/kg/min
b) <2 mcg/kg/min
c) 1o-2o mcg/kg/min
d) >2o mcg/kg/min","The dose at which dopamine acts on β-1 receptors is 2-1o mcg/kg/min.
The systemic effects of dopamine vary with its concentration in the body.
when administered at an infusion rate of 2-5 mcg/kg/min, it directly stimulates cardiac β receptors. This enhances myocardial contractility and is useful in the management of cardiogenic shock.
At doses of 5-15 mcg/kg/min and above, it stimulates α adrenergic receptors. This causes peripheral arterial and venous vasoconstriction.
At lower doses of <2 mcg/kg/min, it directly stimulates both D1 and D2 receptors. The D1 receptors in renal and mesenteric blood vessels are the most sensitive: i.v. infusion of low dose of DA dilates these vessels subsequently, causing increased renal blood flow and increased urine output.
The clinical indications of dopamine include cardiogenic and vasodilatory shock, congestive cardiac failure and symptomatic bradycardia unresponsive to atropine or pacing.
The major side effects are:
• Severe hypertension (especially when taken with nonselective β-blockers)
• Ventricular arrhythmias

Question 21,which of the following is the incorrect statement regarding clomiphene citrate?,"a) causes monofollicular development
b) Inhibits negative feedback on GnRH
c) causes endometrial thinning
d) can be used with gonadotropin","The incorrect statement regarding clomiphene citrate is that it causes monofollicular development; rather, it causes multifollicular development.
clomiphene is an unequal mixture of two isomers, enclomiphene and zuclomiphene.
zuclomiphene is a non-steroidal compound closely resembling an estrogen, blocks the negative inhibitory feedback of estrogens on the hypothalamus, causing a surge of gonadotropins (FSH, LH), which leads to ovulation. The continued flow of FSH encourages multiple follicular development which is relatively common.
Being an anti-estrogen, it causes thickening of cervical mucus and thinning of the endometrium.
clomiphene citrate (cc) is used for the treatment of absent or irregular ovulation due to hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction associated with normal levels of endogenous estradiol; the patient must be treated repeatedly until pregnancy is achieved since the normal cyclic ovulatory function does not usually resume. clomiphene citrate has no effect on patients with ovarian or pituitary failure. Ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate and a gonadotropin like FSH increases the likelihood of multiple concurrent ovulations.
Side effects of cc include hot flushes and some nausea. However, it is usually very well tolerated.",,A,
Question 22,what is the mechanism of action of remdesivir?,"a) RNA-dependent DNA polymerase inhibition
b) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibition
c) Fusion inhibition
d) Entry inhibition","The mechanism of action of remdesivir is inhibition of the enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is an adenosine nucleotide prodrug. It distributes into cells where it is metabolized to form remdesivir triphosphate (RDV-TP). It binds to the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and inhibits viral replication by prematurely terminating RNA transcription.
Remdesivir (under Emergency use Authorization) is used in the treatment of cOVID-19. It may be considered in patients with moderate to severe disease, requiring supplemental oxygen, within 1o days of onset of the illness.
Dose: 2oo mg IV on day 1 followed by 1oo mg IV daily for 4 days (total 5 days).
The following are contraindications to the use of remdesivir:
• Renal or hepatic dysfunction (eGFR <3o ml/min/m2; AST/ALT >5 times upper limit of normal) (Not an absolute contraindication)
• Pregnant or lactating females
• patients <12 years of age
• patients who are not on oxygen support or in-home settings
Remdesivir can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, elevated transaminase levels, increased prothrombin time, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hence, liver function tests and prothrombin time should be obtained before and during treatment with remdesivir.
other options:
option A- RNA-dependent DNA polymerase / reverse transcriptase inhibitors prevent the conversion of viral RNA into proviral DNA. They help to prevent infection of susceptible cells but do not eradicate the virus from cells that are integrated with proviral DNA. Examples: zidovudine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, didanosine, zalcitabine, and emtricitabine. These are drugs used to manage HIV infection.
options C and D- Entry/fusion inhibitors include enfuvirtide and maraviroc. Enfuvirtide inhibits the fusion of viral and cell membranes mediated by gp41 and CD4 interactions. Maraviroc is a chemokine receptor antagonist and binds to host cell CCR5 receptor to block binding of viral gp12o. They are also used to manage HIV infection.",,B,
Question 23,Administration of which of the following drugs would increase the bioavailability of saquinavir?,"a) Ritonavir
b) vitamin c
c) cimetidine
d) Ganciclovir","Administration of ritonavir would increase the bioavailability of saquinavir.
saquinavir is an HIV protease inhibitor that inhibits replication of both HIV-1 and HIV-2. It is metabolized predominantly by the hepatic enzyme Cyp3A4. Inhibition of Cyp3A4 results in an increase or a boost in the concentration of saquinavir. Ritonavir is one such drug that inhibits Cyp3A4. Therefore combining it with a protease inhibitor like saquinavir results in:
• Enhanced bioavailability
• Inhibition of systemic clearance
• Inhibition of first-pass metabolism, and
• Longer half-life of the co-administered HIV protease inhibitor.
This allows for a reduction of drug dose and dosing frequency of saquinavir.
All protease inhibitors except for nelfinavir are predominantly metabolized by Cyp3A4. Therefore, the administration of Cyp3A4 inhibitors like ritonavir or cobicistat can increase the bioavailability of these protease inhibitors. This phenomenon is known as boosting protease inhibitors by Cyp inhibitors. The dosage of ritonavir, when given as a booster drug, is 1oo to 2oomg once or twice daily.
other options :
option B: Vitamin C / Ascorbic acid is a water-soluble vitamin that can actually reduce the steady-state concentration of protease inhibitors. It increases the absorption of dietary iron.
option C: Cimetidine is a histamine 2 receptor antagonist which is used to promote gastric and duodenal ulcer healing. It is used in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease. It also inhibits Cyps, but only ritonavir and cobicistat are used for boosting protease inhibitors.
option D: Ganciclovir is a guanine nucleoside analogue which has inhibitory activity against all herpes viruses, especially cytomegalovirus (CMV).",,A,
Question 24,"The table below gives the AUc of drug B alone and that of drug B when combined with another drug A. If the ■ value is <o.o1, then which of the following statements is true?","a) Drug A decreases intestinal absorption of Drug B
b) Drug A reduces first pass metabolism of Drug B
c) Drug A increases the metabolism of Drug B
d) Drug A increases renal elimination of Drug B","Drug A reduces the first-pass metabolism of Drug B.
The area under the plot of plasma concentration of a drug versus time after dosage is called the area under the curve or AUC. It can be used as a measure of the bioavailability of a drug and to calculate its clearance rate from the body.
Bioavailability refers to the extent to which an administered dose of the drug reaches its site of action; if the metabolic and excretory capacity of the intestine or liver for the drug is large, bioavailability is reduced substantially and this is called the first-pass metabolism whereas bioavailability is increased if intestinal absorption of the drug is increased.
The greater the AUC, the greater is the bioavailability of the drug.
In the question, is observed that when drug A was given along with drug B, the total AUC has increased (82o seconds ± 124 seconds) when compared to the AUC when drug B is administered alone (57o seconds ± 127 seconds).
The null hypothesis for the above question would be that drug A doesn't increase the AUC for drug B and for this to be true, ■ value should be >o.o5.
As given ■ value is <o.o1, it is significant and the null hypothesis is rejected, which means that drug A has indeed increased the AUC for drug B.
This indicates increased bioavailability of drug B when administered with drug A, which shows that drug A has either increased the intestinal absorption of drug B or has reduced its first-pass metabolism.
other options:
option A: If drug A decreased the intestinal absorption of drug B, this would mean that the AUC for drug B, when administered with drug A, would be reduced. This is due to decreased bioavailability of drug B when given with drug A.
option C: If drug A increases the metabolism of drug B, this would lead to a shorter t1/2 and duration of action of drug B, thereby decreasing the AUC for when drug B and drug A are given together.
option D: If drug A increased the elimination of drug B, the AUC for drug B when given with drug A would be reduced due to reduced duration of action of drug B.",,B,IMAGE Q
Question 25,what is the mechanism of action of cyclosporine?,"a) Inhibition of calcineurin
b) AMP kinase stimulation
c) IMP dehydrogenase inhibition
d) Dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase inhibition","The mechanism of action of cyclosporine is inhibition of calcineurin activity.
Calcineurin is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase required for the induction of T cell lymphokine production and proliferation. Cyclosporine is an immunomodulatory drug that inhibits calcineurin activity by forming a complex with cyclophilin, a cytoplasmic-receptor protein present in target cells, to form a cyclosporine-cyclophilin complex. This drug-receptor complex specifically and competitively binds to and inhibits calcineurin, a calcium and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase. This in turn, inhibits the translocation of a family of transcription factors (NF-AT), leading to reduced transcriptional activation of cytokine genes for interleukin (IL)-2, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-3, IL-4, cD4OL, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interferon-gamma. ultimately, the proliferation of T lymphocytes is reduced, resulting in immunomodulation.
Its uses are :
• In solid organ transplantation, to treat organ rejection in kidney, liver, and heart allogeneic transplants.
• In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, when the disease has not adequately responded to methotrexate.
• It is approved to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig disease) and its variants.
• In nephrotic syndrome, to treat focal segmental glomerulosclerosis not responding to corticosteroids.
Adverse effects of cyclosporine include a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and metabolic disturbances like hypomagnesemia, hyperkalemia, dyslipidemia, gynecomastia, hypertrichosis; neurotoxicity in the form of convulsions. There is an increased risk of developing skin and lymphoproliferative malignancies in cyclosporine-treated psoriasis patients.
other options:
option B: AMP kinase is stimulated by metformin, a first-line orally administered drug in the management of type-2 diabetes mellitus.
option c: IMP dehydrogenase is inhibited reversibly by the drug mycophenolate mofetil, which is indicated in the prophylaxis of transplant rejection.
option D: Dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase is inhibited by leflunomide, a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor indicated for the management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults.",,A,
Question 26,Anionic and weakly acidic drugs bind to which of the following?,"a) Albumin
b) Globulin
c) Lipoprotein
d) Alpha-1 glycoprotein","Anionic and weakly acidic drugs bind to albumin.
After being distributed in the circulating blood, drugs bind to serum proteins to varying degrees. Among serum proteins, albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein play important roles in protein binding for many drugs, which affects their distribution in the body.
Albumin is a major carrier of and binds to acidic drugs like phenytoin, NSAIDs. whereas, α-1 acid glycoprotein binds basic drugs like lignocaine,disopyramide, quinidine and propranolol.
Importance of plasma protein binding:
conditions resulting in acute phase reaction response leading to elevated levels of alpha-1 acid glycoprotein like crohn’s disease, myocardial infarction, arthritis, cancer, etc. enhance binding of basic drugs. conditions causing hypoalbuminemia result in decreased binding sites for acidic drugs.
when a drug is bound to the plasma proteins, it is kept in the blood, while the unbound (free) drug can produce a therapeutic effect, be metabolized, or excreted. In the majority of the drugs, this does not have a significant effect, but in drugs with a narrow therapeutic index like warfarin, it is clinically relevant as excessive free warfarin can produce toxicity.
Many drugs displace other drugs from their protein binding sites. This may cause an increase in the pharmacological effect of the displaced drug.
A drug bound to a plasma protein cannot cross membranes and this bound fraction of a drug is also not available for metabolism or glomerular filtration which can make the drug long-acting.
other options:
option B- Globulins are of three types - α ,β , and γ-globulins. Globulins bind glucocorticoids and progesterone in the blood.
option C- Lipoproteins like VLDL, LDL can bind anti-cancer drugs like 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin.",,A,
Question 27,A 14-month-old boy was diagnosed with Hemophilus influenza meningitis. The initial treatment plan was to start on ampicillin but later was shifted to ceftriaxone. what could be the probable reason?,"a) Hemophilus alters penicillin binding protein sites, hence resistant to ampicillin
b) Easier to administer IV ceftriaxone than IV ampicillin
c) cotrimoxazole is the drug of choice, but patient is allergic to sulfa drugs
d) Hemophilus produces beta lactamase, hence resistant to ampicillin","The probable reason why the drug to be administered was changed from ampicillin to ceftriaxone is because Hemophilus produces beta-lactamase and hence, is resistant to ampicillin.
A considerable percentage of isolates of Hemophilus influenzae produce beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to ampicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic. However, these strains are still sensitive to second and third-generation cephalosporins.
In H. influenzae, the resistance to ampicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics is generally due to the production of a β-lactamase. In the case of β-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains, resistance is due to the presence of altered penicillin-binding proteins.
Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that is effective against Hemophilus Influenzae and considerably resistant to beta-lactamase. It has a very long half-life which permits once-daily dosing of the drug. Because of the efficacy of third-generation cephalosporins in the therapy of meningitis caused by Hemophilus Influenzae type b, ceftriaxone administered at the rate of 5o mg/kg/dose given 12th hourly should be a part of the initial empirical therapy.
Vancomycin combined with a third-generation cephalosporin like ceftriaxone is the recommended empirical antibiotic regimen in a suspected case of meningitis, beyond the neonatal period.",,D,
Question 28,A patient who is a known case of cirrhosis of the liver presents with abdominal distension and swelling of the lower limbs. The preferred diuretic for this patient would be,"a) Triamterene
b) Eplerenone
c) chlorthalidone
d) Furosemide","The preferred diuretic for this patient with cirrhosis presenting with abdominal distension and lower limb swelling is eplerenone.
Eplerenone is a mineralocorticoid receptor/aldosterone antagonist. High doses of mineralocorticoid receptor/aldosterone antagonists decrease total body sodium in cirrhotic patients with ascites by natriuresis.
patients with liver cirrhosis have a decreased effective arterial blood volume because of splanchnic vasodilatation. This stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and results in hyperaldosteronism. This causes increased sodium and water retention and leads to the development of ascites. This also contributes to resistance to loop diuretics.
Normally, aldosterone (AL) enters the cells of the late distal tubule and collecting ducts by diffusion and binds to a specific mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in the cytoplasm. This AL-MR complex mediates Na+ reabsorption, which drives the secretion of K+ and H+into the tubules.
Eplerenone competitively blocks this MR, preventing it from binding with aldosterone. The net effect is sodium diuresis and potassium retention. It is a potassium-sparing diuretic. other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists include spironolactone, canrenone, potassium canrenoate.
some clinical uses of MR antagonists are -
• Hypertension due to primary hyperaldosteronism
• Edema associated with liver cirrhosis, congestive cardiac failure, chronic kidney disease
• They may reduce mortality in patients with myocardial infarction
Hyperkalemia is the major side effect of MR antagonists, the risk being greater in patients with renal disease or those already taking AcE inhibitors. other important side effects are gynecomastia and decreased libido due to the anti-androgenic effect of spironolactone but eplerenone does not cause gynecomastia and decreased libido.
other options :
option A- Triamterene directly inhibits renal epithelial sodium channels (ENac) in the late distal tubule and collecting duct. It is a potassium-sparing diuretic and is generally used along with other diuretics in the treatment of hypertension and edema. Triamterene is metabolized in the liver, hence triamterene toxicity may be enhanced in patients with hepatic disease. It is used in the management of Liddle syndrome.
option c- chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic. It inhibits Na+-cl- symporter in the early distal tubule and increases the excretion of sodium and chloride. Thiazide diuretics may be used for the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, nephrolithiasis due to idiopathic hypercalciuria, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
option D- Furosemide is a loop diuretic. It acts by inhibiting the Na+-K+-2cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle resulting in increased excretion of sodium and chloride. It also has mild carbonic anhydrase inhibitory activity and also increases urinary excretion of bicarbonate and phosphate. cirrhotic patients are often resistant to loop diuretics due to decreased secretion of the drug into tubular fluid and high aldosterone levels. Furosemide may be given along with eplerenone, but the best answer here is eplerenone since aldosterone antagonists are the main therapy for cirrhotic edema.",,B,
Question 29,which of the following is the most effective drug in smoking cessation?,"a) varenicline
b) Buspirone SR
c) Nicotine gum
d) Rimonabant","varenicline is the most effective drug in smoking cessation.
Nicotine is the principal constituent of tobacco responsible for its addictive behaviour. one of the newest agents introduced to aid in smoking cessation is varenicline.
varenicline works by blocking the effects of nicotine on the brain. It blocks α-4, β-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes and varenicline inhibits dopaminergic activation produced by smoking through their partial agonism, and decreases the craving and withdrawal syndrome that occurs with cessation attempts. It prevents nicotine stimulation of the mesolimbic dopamine system associated with nicotine addiction, thus helping to occlude the ""rewarding"" effect of smoking.
varenicline is prescribed only to patients 18 years or older. varenicline is taken orally and the dose taken is o.5 mg once daily on days 1 to 3, increased to o.5 mg twice daily on days 4 through 7 and 1 mg twice daily after day 8 for 11 weeks. Therapy should start one week before the target quit date. It can be continued for another 12 weeks (1 mg BD) to maintain abstinence.
The adverse effects include nausea, which can be mitigated by starting at lower doses and gradually increasing the dose. other symptoms include disturbed sleep, sleepwalking, agitation, drowsiness, and constipation and may also increase the risk of pancreatitis. varenicline has also been implicated in specific skin syndromes such as stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, and photosensitivity. varenicline can cause renal failure and kidney stones, thus renal function must be monitored.
The FDA has issued a warning about mood and behavioral changes associated with its use, and there is some evidence of increased cardiovascular risk.
other options:
option B: Buspirone sustained release is a partial agonist at 5HT receptors but affinity for D2 receptors may also be present. Its effects are slow onset, over a couple of weeks and is used in the management of generalised anxiety states.
option C: Nicotine gum has nicotine which is an agonist at Nn type nicotinic cholinergic receptors and is also advised for smoking cessation along with psychotherapy. However, varenicline was more effective when compared with single■product nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and was similarly effective compared with combination NRT.
option D: Rimonabant is an inverse agonist at cannabinoid receptor CB1 which decreases neurotransmitter release at GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses; its usage for smoking cessation and treat obesity was stopped after serious side effects notably severe depression and increased risk of suicide. However, it continues to be used off-label for smoking cessation.",,A,
Question 30,A patient who was on warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation is prescribed a cephalosporin antibiotic for the treatment of a lower respiratory tract infection. He reports back to the hospital after having developed hemarthrosis. which of the following cephalosporins is likely to have caused this?,"a) cefixime
b) cefoperazone
c) ceftobiprole
d) ceftazidime","The cephalosporin antibiotic most likely to have caused hemarthrosis in this patient on warfarin therapy is cefoperazone.
Cephalosporins containing a methylthiotetrazole (NMTT) group can prolong the prothrombin time. This results in clinically significant bleeding in patients already on anticoagulant therapy or having vitamin K deficiency.
This is because NMTT cephalosporins inhibit the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase in the liver, which is the key enzyme for vitamin K-dependent carboxylation, a posttranslational modification that is essential for the biological functions of coagulation factors.
NMTT group containing cephalosporins include latamoxef, cefmenoxime, cefoperazone, cefotetan, cefamandole.
vitamin K epoxide reductase is also the target of anticoagulants like warfarin. oral administration of vitamin K can prevent this problem.",,B,
Question 31,which of the following is a novel anti-depressant?,"a) Lurasidone
b) vilazodone
c) Asenapine
d) Blonanserin","vilazodone is the novel antidepressant.
The antidepressant effect of vilazodone is due to its enhancement of serotonergic activity in the CNS through selective inhibition of serotonin reuptake. It binds with high affinity to the serotonin reuptake site but not to the norepinephrine or dopamine reuptake site. As a result, vilazodone potently and selectively inhibits the reuptake of serotonin.
vilazodone is also a partial agonist at serotonergic 5-HT1A receptors; the result of this activity on serotonergic transmission also plays a role in its antidepressant effect.
Thus it offers a novel combination of selective serotonin reuptake inhibition (SSRI) and serotonergic (5-HT1A) receptor partial agonist activity. Because of these characteristics, vilazodone has been termed a serotonin partial agonist–reuptake inhibitor (SPARI).
vilazodone is never combined with a monoamine oxidase (MAo) inhibitor or given within 14 days of discontinuing or initiating MAo inhibitor therapy due to the serious risk of serotonin toxicity.
other options:
option A: Lurasidone is a second-generation antipsychotic that is a 5-HT2A and D2 receptor antagonist. it is used in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar depression (as monotherapy or as an adjunct).
option C: Asenapine is a second-generation antipsychotic which is also a 5-HT2A and D2 receptor antagonist, used in the management of schizophrenia and acute mania.
option D: Blonanserin is a second-generation antipsychotic, which acts as an antagonist at D2, D3, and 5-HT2A receptors. Blonanserin has a low affinity for 5-HT2C, adrenergic α1, histamine H1, and muscarinic M1 receptors, but displays a relatively high affinity for 5-HT6 receptors. It is used in the management of schizophrenia.",,B,
Question 32,"A 57-year-old man was brought to the hospital with complaints of dizziness and breathlessness. During his physical examination, you notice the following discolouration over his face. He is presently being treated with amiodarone, metoprolol, verapamil, lisinopril, and amlodipine. which of the following drugs is most likely responsible?","a) Amiodarone
b) Amlodipine
c) Metoprolol
d) verapamil","The image shows grey-blue discolouration over this patient's face and the drug responsible for this is amiodarone.
Long-term treatment with amiodarone is responsible for skin pigmentation. Elderly men are at an increased risk of developing this.
ultraviolet light reacts with amiodarone and its metabolites to cause local vasodilatation. This increases the diffusion of amiodarone and its metabolites, resulting in their deposition in the tissues, causing pigmentation. Therefore, it is usually seen in sun-exposed areas.
cessation of amiodarone, avoiding exposure to sunlight using sunscreen cream is recommended.
Amiodarone is an iodine-containing compound that is structurally related to thyroid hormone. It is a class III antiarrhythmic drug, which increases the duration of an action potential by blocking potassium channels. It thereby increases the time taken for repolarization. It also prolongs the refractory period and suppresses abnormal automaticity. It also has weak calcium channel blocking, sodium channel blocking, and adrenergic blocking actions.
It is used to maintain normal sinus rhythm during atrial fibrillation and prevent recurrent ventricular tachycardia.
Adverse effects of amiodarone:
• prolonged usage of amiodarone causes interstitial lung disease.
• Heart blocks, bradycardia and QT prolongation
• Hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism
• corneal micro-deposits and vortex keratopathy, optic neuropathy

Question 33,which of the following is a centrally acting opioid antitussive?,"a) Ambroxol
b) Diphenoxylate
c) Levopropoxyphene
d) Levorphanol","Levopropoxyphene is a centrally acting opioid antitussive.
Levopropoxyphene is an opioid derivative that is a strong and partial μ receptor agonist that helps to reduce the cough reflex and therefore, is used in the management of acute debilitating cough. The usual antitussive dose is 5o–1oo mg every 4 hours. It has no analgesic activity. However, it is known to cause some sedation.
other options:
option A: Ambroxol is derived from bromhexine. It is a mucoactive agent that helps alter the viscoelastic properties of mucus and increase mucociliary clearance, thereby providing relief in productive cough. It is commonly available as intramuscular or intravenous, lozenges, syrups, or tablets.
option B: Diphenoxylate is an opioid agonist that is structurally similar to meperidine. It is used in the treatment of acute, chronic, and traveler's diarrhea. upon administration, it undergoes de-esterification to difenoxin, which is its active metabolite. Its side effects include constipation, toxic megacolon, paralytic ileus and can give rise to cNS depression in children.
option D: Levorphanol is a synthetic opioid that is also a 5HT/Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and an NMDA receptor antagonist which is chiefly used in the management of moderate to severe pain and has a relatively rapid onset of action. Its side effects include delirium and hallucinations.",,C,
Question 34,The anti-epileptic drugs which can also be used for the treatment of neuropathic pain are,"a) 1, 2 and 3
b) 1, 2 and 4
c) 1, 3 and 4
d) 2 and 4 only","The anti-epileptic drugs which can also be used for neuropathic pain are 1, 2, and 4 which are pregabalin, carbamazepine and gabapentin respectively.
pregabalin is an anti-epileptic drug that acts by binding to α2δ , a protein that is a subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels and causes a decrease in glutamate release at excitatory synapses. It is used in the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, spinal cord injury or postherpetic neuralgia.
Gabapentin is an anti-epileptic drug that, like pregabalin, acts by binding to α2δ protein. It is used in the management of neuropathic pain due to postherpetic neuralgia in adults.
The binding of gabapentin and pregabalin, also called ""gabapentinoids"" due to their structural similarity to GABA, to calcium channel subunit a2δ protein, is considered to mediate the anti-convulsant effects of gabapentin and pregabalin. They are used in focal onset seizures with or without progression to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures when used in addition to other anti-epileptic drugs.
carbamazepine is an iminostilbine derivative. It blocks voltage-activated sodium channels, slowing their rate of recovery and limiting the repetitive firing of action potentials. It is used in the treatment of:
• Generalized, focal-to-bilateral and idiopathic tonic-clonic seizures
• Focal seizures
• Neuropathic pain associated with trigeminal and glossopharyngeal neuralgias.
Lamotrigine is an anti-folate agent whose mechanism of action is similar to that of carbamazepine i.e. it delays the recovery from inactivation of recombinant sodium channels. It also inhibits the release of glutamate by acting directly on the sodium channels. Therefore, when used concurrently with carbamazepine, is associated with toxicity in some patients due to increase in 1o,11- epoxide of carbamazepine. It is useful in the management of:
• Focal and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults
• Lennox-Gastaut syndrome - a childhood disorder characterized by multiple type seizures, mental retardation, and refractoriness to anti-seizure medication.",,B,
Question 35,A breast cancer patient post-chemotherapy developed a low-grade fever with anemia and leukocytopenia (<4ooo/cm3; DNC: 3o). which of the following antibiotics will not be used in the empirical management of this patient?,"a) Cefepime
b) piperacillin-Tazobactam
c) Linezolid
d) Meropenem","Linezolid cannot be used in this patient as bone marrow suppression is a side effect of this drug and hence it can worsen the post-chemotherapy bone marrow suppression in this patient.
Linezolid can cause myelosuppression which can present as anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. It is commonly associated with thrombocytopenia and is seen 7-1o days following administration. This is usually reversed on discontinuation of the drug.
other adverse effects of linezolid:
• It inhibits mitochondrial protein synthesis and may lead to peripheral neuropathy, optic neuritis, and lactic acidosis in patients receiving the drug for longer durations.
• It can cause serotonin syndrome when coadministered with adrenergic or serotonergic drugs like SSRIs due to its nonspecific MAO inhibition.
It is a protein synthesis inhibitor of the class oxazolidinones. It mainly acts against gram-positive organisms. It is approved for the treatment of the following conditions:
• Skin and skin structure infections by staphylococcus(Both MRSA and MSSA) and streptococcus.
• community-acquired pneumonia due to streptococcus pneumoniae.
• Nosocomial pneumonia due to staphylococcus aureus.
