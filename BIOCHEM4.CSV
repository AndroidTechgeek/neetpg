Question 1,Dicoumarol inhibits the action of vitamin k by?,"a) suicide inhibition
b) competitive inhibition
c) Non competitive inhibition
d) uncompetitive inhibition","Dicoumarol inhibits the action of vitamin K by competitive inhibition.
Dicoumarol and warfarin competitively inhibit the gamma-carboxylation system due to structural similarity with vitamin K. Therefore, they can act as anticoagulants used for therapeutic purposes.
vitamin k epoxide is reduced to the quinone form by epoxide reductase, which is sensitive to inhibition by warfarin and dicoumarol.",,B,nan;746-608.PNG
Question 2,"A TPN bag consists of 1oog glucose, 3og amino acids, and 4og lipids. what is the amount of calories delivered?","a) 84o kcal
b) 88o kcal
c) 64o kcal
d) 68o kcal","The amount of calories delivered by the given TpN (Total parenteral Nutrition) bag is 88o kcal. The caloric value of different food components are:
• carbohydrate (glucose) - 4kcal/g
• proteins (amino acids) - 4.2kcal/g = ~4kcal/g
• Fat (lipids) - 9kcal/g
calculation of the number of calories:
• 1oo gm of glucose = 1oo x 4kcal=4oo kcal
• 3o gm of amino acids = 3o x 4 kcal= 12o kcal
• 4o gm of lipids = 4o x 9 kcal= 36o kcal
Total amount of calories delivered= 4oo+12o+36o=88o kcal
Note: The caloric value of alcohol is 7kcal/g.",,B,
Question 3,what is true about the Hayflick limit?,"a) Human cells can divide a finite number of times only
b) Free radical oxidation level is unrestricted
c) Telomerase activity is unrestricted
d) RNA polymerase can function for. a finite number of times only","The Hayflick limit says that human cells can divide for a finite number of times.
The Hayflick limit is the number of divisions a cell population can go through in culture before division stops and enters a state known as senescence. with the exception of stem cells, all the other human cells have only a limited capacity for cell division. This biological clock is of great help in the study of the normal ageing process.
The number of cell divisions of the cultured cell is roughly related to:
• The age of the cell donors
• The longevity of the species
For example, fibroblasts from the human embryos, when sustained in tissue culture, divide about 5o times before they die. Those taken from person after birth divide only 2o to 3o times.",,A,
Question 4,Ammonia in the brain is detoxified to form _________,"a) urea
b) Glutamine
c) Ammonium ions
d) Alanine","Ammonia in the brain is detoxified to form glutamine.
Glutamine synthetase combines ammonia with glutamate to form glutamine. It requires the hydrolysis of ATP.
Deficiency of glutamine synthetase in neonates results in severe brain damage, multiorgan failure, and death.
Note: Glutamine is the transport form of ammonia from the brain and intestine to the liver; while alanine is the transport form from the muscle.",,B,
Question 5,The sequence of vitamin D synthesis is?,"a) Liver- skin- kidney
b) skin- Liver- kidney
c) skin- kidney- Liver
d) Liver- kidney- skin","The sequence of vitamin D synthesis is skin-liver-kidney.
The sequence of vitamin D synthesis:
step 1: In the skin: 7-Dehydrocholesterol (an intermediate in cholesterol synthesis that accumulates in the skin) undergoes a nonenzymic reaction on exposure to ultraviolet light, yielding cholecalciferol, which is absorbed into the bloodstream.
step 2: In the liver: cholecalciferol is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (calcidiol). This is released into the circulation bound to a vitamin D–binding globulin, which is the main storage form of the vitamin.
step 3: In the kidney: 25-hydroxycholecalciferol is converted to either 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol), the biologically active form by the enzyme 1α-hydroxylase.",,B,nan;748-609.PNG
Question 6,Glucose is stored in the form of glycogen because __________,"a) It is compact
b) It has multiple reducing ends
c) It can be stored at multiple organs
d) It can provide glucose for about 1 week when needed","Among the given options, the most appropriate answer would be option A i.e Glucose is stored in the form of glycogen because it is compact.
Glycogen is the major storage carbohydrate in animals, corresponding to starch in plants. It is a branched polymer of α-d-glucose.
other options:
The major sites of storage are liver and muscle, that is, it can't be stored at multiple sites.
It does not have multiple reducing ends. It instead has multiple non-reducing ends.
Liver glycogen functions as a reserve to maintain the blood glucose concentration in the fasting state. After about 18 hours of fasting, most of the liver glycogen is depleted and hence it can not provide glucose for up to 1 week.",,A,
Question 7,"DNA methylation is not related to? a) Mismatch repair
b) Chromatin Remodelling
c) DNA replication
d) Gene silencing","DNA methylation is not related to DNA replication as DNA methylation is stable during replication and cell cycle arrest.
chromatin remodeling by methylation/histone acetylation is an important aspect of transcription regulation.
Methylation of genes also plays an important part in gene silencing. Ex:- promoter
hypermethylation in tumor suppressor genes contributes to the development of cancers.
The process of mismatch repair relies upon a DNA-methylation excision signal, especially in E. coli.",,C,,
Question 8,The enzyme that is not used in cholesterol synthesis?,"a) Thiolase
b) HMG CoA reductase
c) HMG CoA synthase
d) HMG CoA lyase","Among the given options, the enzyme HMG CoA lyase is not used in cholesterol synthesis. It is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the breakdown of proteins and fats.
Cholesterol is a 27-carbon compound consisting of four rings and a side chain. It is synthesized from acetyl-CoA.
The major sites of synthesis of cholesterol are the liver, adrenal cortex, testes, ovaries, and intestine. All nucleated cells can synthesize cholesterol, including arterial walls. The enzymes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol are partly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and partly in the cytoplasm.
Initially, two molecules of acetyl-CoA condense to form acetoacetyl-CoA catalyzed by cytosolic thiolase. This acetoacetyl- CoA enters the cholesterol synthesis pathway along with a molecule of acetyl-CoA.
The image below shows the enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis:",,D,nan;749-610.PNG
Question 9,The enzyme that is common for both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis is?,"a) pyruvate kinase
b) phosphofructokinase
c) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
d) phosphoglycerate kinase","The enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase is common for both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. phosphoglycerate kinase catalyzes the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate, which is a reversible step involved in both the processes.
Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are processes that are reverse of each other. All the reversible steps of these two processes are catalyzed by the same enzymes, therefore are common to both.
The irreversible steps of glycolysis are catalyzed by the following enzymes:
• Hexokinase
• phosphofructokinase
• pyruvate kinase
The irreversible steps of gluconeogenesis are catalyzed by the following enzymes:
• pyruvate carboxylase
• phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
• Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase
• Glucose-6-phosphatase",,D,nan;750-611.PNG
Question 10,The given chemical structure is of:,"a) keratan sulfate
b) Chondroitin sulfate
c) Heparin
d) Dermatan sulfate","The given chemical structure is of chondroitin sulfate.
Chondroitin sulfate is composed of repeating units of N-acetyl galactosamine with sulfate and glucuronic acid. Some important features of chondroitin sulfate are as follows:
• The most abundant GAG in the body.
• Location: Cartilage, CNS, bone
• They are located at sites of calcification in endochondral bone and are a major component of cartilage.
• They are found in high amounts in the ECM of the central nervous system.",741-605.PNG,B,
Question 11,The correct order of steps in Polymerase Chain Reaction (pCR) is:,"a) Hybridisation, Annealing, Elongation, Denaturation
b) Elongation, Denaturation, Hybridisation, Annealing
c) Denaturation, Annealing, Extension
d) Annealing, Extension, Denaturation","The correct sequence of events for pCR among the given options is denaturation, annealing, and extension.
The process of PCR is as follows:
The DNA sample is first heat-denatured at >9o°C (9o-96 degrees Celsius for 3 minutes) to separate the two strands ofthe template DNA containing the target sequence; the primers (which attach to the 3' end of the flanking sequence) are added in excess, are allowed to anneal to the DNA (typically at 5o-75°C) in order to generate the required template-primer hybridization complex. under suitable conditions and presence of deoxynucleotides, elongation of the DNA stand occurs.
The number of copies produced in the presence of an unlimited supply of deoxynucleotides and enzymes is given by - 2 to the power n (where n is the number of PCR cycles)
• 2o cycles provide an amplification of 22o 〓 1o6 or 1 million copies
• 3o cycles provides an amplification of 23o 〓1o9 or 1 billion copies
Below is an image showing the various ingredients for carrying out PCR.",,C,nan;751-612.PNG
Question 12,Which of the following is not a true statement regarding telomerase?,"a) Has reverse transcriptase activity
b) present only in eukaryotes
c) Maintain the chromosome length
d) Involved in DNA repair","The false statement is that telomerase is involved in DNA repair.
Telomeres are the end of chromosomal DNA. since prokaryotic DNA is circular, it does not have free ends and hence no telomeres. Thus, telomeres are present only in eukaryotes Telomeres have TG- rich repeats and usually do not code for any proteins. with every DNA replication during cell division, telomere shortening occurs. once telomeres are almost negligible or non-existent in length, the DNA is unable to replicate and the cell dies. Hence, there is a limit to the number of times a cell can divide.
In stem cells and cancer cells, an enzyme telomerase having reverse transcriptase activity (RNA dependent DNA polymerase) adds telomeres to the chromosome ends, thereby preserving chromosomal length. It allows the stem cells and cancer cells to multiply a lot more number of times than a normal adult cell.",,D,
Question 13,"The illustration below shows alternative splicing of a gene which has intron segments 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. It yields two products A and B, by the action of different promoters. You are provided with the promoters w, x, y, and z, each of which binds to a different segment as shown below and acts in the marked direction. Which of the following promoters will you use to get product A?","a) W,X,Y
b) W,Z
c) W,X
d) W, Y","Among the given options, using primers W and Y will yield the desired product A.
promoters or DNA regulatory elements usually precedes the desired exon to be transcribed. It helps redirect transcription of only the desired exons of a gene to yield a product. Alternative splicing utilizes different promoters to code slightly different products from the same gene.
In this question, the desired product A has segments 1,3,4,5 whilst the other product B has 1,2,4,5. The difference between both is the presence of seg 3 in product A and the presence of seg 2 in product B. As the product in question is A, only seg 3 is required while excluding seg 2 and ensuring seg 1,4 and 5 intact.
• seg 1- Needs to be transcribed and so W is essential
• seg 2- Does not need to be transcribed.
• seg 3- Needs to be transcribed and so Y is essential
• seg 4- Needs to be transcribed but Z is not essential as Y continues the transcription in the direction shown by the arrow.
The answer is hence promoter W and Y.",742-606.PNG,D,
Question 14,Gibbs free energy curve of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is given by,"a) B
b) A
c) C
d) D","Among the given graphs, the Gibbs free energy change of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is shown by graph A (option B).
Graph B (option A) cannot represent the Gibbs free energy of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, as the energy state of an intermediate cannot be lower than the product. A lower energy state of the intermediate implies that the enzyme-intermediate complex is stable and such a complex will usually not further form a product.
During any chemical reaction, the product is formed by the breaking of substrate bonds and the conformational change of the substrate into a highly unstable transition state. This transition state is denoted by the peak of the graph. The Gibbs free energy curve of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction (with no intermediate state) is shown in the image given below:
The below graph shows the normal intermediate formation with an energy state still higher than that of the product:
All the reactions have a transition state, but not all reactions have an intermediate state. Every intermediate state is again always followed by another transition state.
Activation energy is the energy difference between the free energy of the substrates and that of the transition state. Because of the high activation energy, the rates of uncatalyzed chemical reactions are often slow.
In an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, the activation energy is reduced by forming a relatively stable intermediate-enzyme complex. Enzymes provide attachment sites for the substrate and speed up the rate of reaction. They don't change the energy state of either the substrate or the product. The Gibbs free energy change remains the same.
Graph C: Free energy change cannot be a straight line. Every reaction passes through a high-energy intermediate transition state.
Graph D: The activation energy of any reaction is never lower than the free energy of the product.",743-607.PNG,B,nan;753-614.PNG;753-613.PNG;754-615.PNG
Question 15,The maximum thermic effect is seen with a meal which has,"a) protein
b) Fat
c) Carbohydrates
d) Mixed meal having all 3 in equal amount","Among the given options, maximum thermic effect is seen with proteins
Specific dynamic allowance (previously called as thermic effect of food): This refers to the increased heat production or increased metabolic rate following the intake of food (diet-induced thermogenesis).
The values of SDA are:
• 3o% for proteins: This means that out of every 1oo grams of proteins consumed, the energy available for doing useful work is 3o% less than the calculated value.
• 15% for lipids, and
• 5% for carbohydrates.",,A,
Question 16,DNA methylation is not involved in?,"a) 1 and 2
b) 2 and 3
c) 1 and 4
d) 2 and 4","DNA methylation is not involved in the base pair excision repair mechanism (statement 4) and RNA splicing (statement 2).
DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification used as a gene expression regulation mechanism. It causes gene silencing by inactivating DNA and hindering the formation of euchromatin (transcriptionally active chromatin). Thus, it also aids in chromatin remodelling.
It however is not involved in the base pair repair mechanism or RNA splicing.",,D,nan;755-616.PNG
Question 17,which of the following enzymes has the highest catalytic efficiency?,"a) km of an enzyme 〓 1o micromole and kcat 〓 2o per sec
b) km of an enzyme 〓 2ooo nanomole and kcat 〓 5o per sec
c) km of an enzyme 〓 2 micromole and kcat 〓 2oo per sec
d) km of an enzyme 〓 4 micromole and kcat 〓 2oo per sec","The highest catalytic efficiency is seen when km〓 2 micromole and kcat 〓 2oo per sec.
catalytic efficiency is calculated as kcat/km, where km is inversely proportional to the binding affinity of the enzyme and kcat is the catalytic constant (vmax divided by the total number of active sites of the enzyme present). Higher values of kcat and lower values of km gives better catalytic efficiency. catalytic efficiency can be used to compare the performance of 2 different enzymes in catalyzing a reaction.
step 1: km of each option after converting respective units to moles will be 1o, 2, 2 and 4 (each multiplied by 1o-6) moles.
step 2: The catalytic efficiency is calculated as kcat/km. on substituting the values in various options after converting to moles, the values come out to be 2, 25, 1oo and 5o (each multiplied by 1o6) M-1 s-1.
some enzymes can be so efficient that they convert the substrate to product instantaneously. They are limited only by the rate at which substrate diffuses towards the enzyme in a solution. These are called diffusion-limited enzymes and their catalytic efficiency is as high as 1o8 M-1 s-1.",,C,
Question 18,which of the following are vitamin-B12 dependent enzymes?,"a) 1, 2 , 3 and 4
b) 1 and 4 only
c) 1 and 3 only
d) 1, 2, and 3","Among the given enzymes, methyl malonyl coA isomerase and methionine synthase are vitamin B12 dependent enzymes.
There are two vitamin B12-dependent enzymes:
• Methionine synthase (homocysteine methyltransferase): Catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine to methionine
• Methylmalonyl CoA mutase: methylmalonyl CoA, formed as an intermediate in the catabolism of valine, isoleucine, and propionyl CoA is converted to succinyl CoA
The below figure shows B12 serving as a cofactor of methionine synthase. Its deficiency may cause a folate trap.",,B,nan;756-617.PNG
Question 19,which of the following enzymes are involved in gluconeogenesis? A. pyruvate carboxylase B. phosphoenol pyruvate kinase C. Hexokinase D. pyruvate kinase E. Glucose 6 phosphatase,"a) A,B,and E only
b) B and C only
c) A and E only
d) A, B and C only","Among the given options, A and E are correct. pyruvate carboxylase and Glucose-6-phosphatase are enzymes used in gluconeogenesis.
Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are 2 metabolic pathways in opposite directions (glucose being the substrate and product respectively). But a few reactions are not reversible in glycolysis. So a different pathway is used or a different enzyme is used by the body to make the reactions feasible.",nan,C,nan;757-618.PNG
Question 20,ketosis is common in type 1 DM due to:,"a) 2,3 and 4
b) 1,2,3 and 4
c) 4 only
d) 1 and 2 only","2, 3 and 4 statements correctly explain the reason behind increased ketogenesis as seen in type1 DM.
Type 1 DM is characterized by a deficiency in insulin production. since insulin is deficient, GLUT4 (insulin-dependent uptake) mediated glucose uptake is not possible in the heart or skeletal muscles. so adipose tissue mobilizes fat to be used as an energy source. These FFA (free fatty acids) are oxidized to acetoacetyl CoA which serves as a precursor for ketone body synthesis.
As the level of serum FFA is raised, proportionately more of the acetyl-CoA produced from their breakdown is converted to ketone bodies and less is oxidized via the citric acid cycle to Co2. A fall in the concentration of oxaloacetate, particularly within the mitochondria, can impair the ability of the citric acid cycle to metabolize acetyl-CoA and divert fatty acid oxidation toward ketogenesis. such a fall may occur because of an increase in the (NADH)/(NAD+) ratio caused when increased β-oxidation alters the equilibrium between oxaloacetate and malate so that the concentration of oxaloacetate is decreased.
Beta-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase is one of the enzymes used in ketone body synthesis.
Increased rate of ketone body synthesis in insulin-deficient state implies an increased activity of beta-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase enzyme.",,A,
