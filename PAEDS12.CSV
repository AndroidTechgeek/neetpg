Q1,"A newborn presented with chest retractions, dyspnea, and lethargy. The pediatrician
diagnosed the baby with respiratory distress syndrome. This occurs due to the deficiency of:","a)Dipalmitoyl inositol
b)Lecithin
c)Sphingomyelin
d)Dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine","Respiratory distress syndrome in a neonate is likely due to the deficiency of lecithin.
Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), also known as hyaline membrane disease, is due to the
decreased production and secretion of the lung surfactant. Surfactant is a lipoprotein primarily
made of phospholipids such as lecithin (otherwise known as dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine). The other minor components are phosphatidylglycerol, apoproteins, and cholesterol. It is synthesized   in type II pneumocytes/granular pneumocytes in the endoplasmic reticulum (shown below).





RDS is commonly seen in preterm babies less than 34 weeks of gestation. Surfactant deficiency  leads to an increase in the surface tension over the alveoli, causing the alveoli to collapse easily   during expiration. Therefore, the baby has to put more effort to expand the lungs. Tachypnea,    cyanosis, nasal flaring, prominent expiratory grunting, and intercostal and subcostal retractions are some of the common findings seen in this condition.
Chest x-ray shows features such as reticulogranular pattern, ground-glass opacity, and
air bronchogram. white-out lungs can be seen on chest x-ray in severe diseases.
Management in mild to moderate RDS is with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), where the positive pressure keeps the alveoli open in a spontaneously breathing baby. Severe cases will    require mechanical ventilation. Steroids increase the production of the surfactant, and therefore,  steroids are administered antenatally to mothers with preterm labor.
other options -
option A: Dipalmitoyl inositol, or phosphatidylinositol, acts as a precursor for the secondary messenger system. It also helps in cell signaling and membrane trafficking.
option C: Sphingomyelin is a dominant sphingolipid in the plasma membrane. The
lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio in amniotic fluid helps in determining fetal lung maturity.
option D: Dipalmitoyl ethanolamine is present in the cell membrane.",,B,5701-3626-1.png
Q2,"A 1o-year-old child weighing 3o kg presents with a history of loose stools for 2 days. on
examination, there is severe dehydration. Laboratory investigations are as follows. what is the initial management as per ISPAD guidelines?","a)Manage ABC, NS 2o mL/kg and start insulin after 1 hour
b)Manage ABC, NS 2o mL/kg along with insulin o.1 IU/kg/hr
c)Manage ABC, NS 1o mL/kg along with insulin o.1 IU/kg/hr
d)Manage ABC, NS 1o mL/kg and start insulin after 1 hour","The given clinical scenario with severe dehydration, hyperglycemia, glucosuria, and metabolic acidosis is suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis. Based on the ISPAD guidelines, the initial
management includes management of the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) and fluid
replacement with an IV bolus of 2o mL/kg NS (Normal saline). This is followed by an IV insulin infusion of o.o5 - o.1 U/kg/hr, at least 1 hour after starting fluid replacement therapy.
The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) guidelines provide
evidence-based recommendations for the management of DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis) in children



and adolescents.
Diabetic ketoacidosis is the most serious complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus. clinical manifestations of diabetic ketoacidosis include:
• Dehydration, tachypnea with deep, sighing respiration (Kussmaul breathing)
• Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain that may mimic an acute abdominal condition
• confusion, drowsiness, and coma in severe cases.
The diagnosis of DKA is based on the triad of hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis. All three biochemical criteria are required to diagnose DKA
• Hyperglycemia (blood glucose &gt;2oo mg/dl)
• Venous pH &lt; 7.3 or serum bicarbonate &lt;18 mmol/L
• Ketonemia or ketonuria
Initial management includes management of the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABc)   according to pediatric Advanced Life Support (pALS) guidelines. Following that emergency assessment is done, which includes:
• Immediate measurement of blood glucose, blood or urine ketones, serum electrolytes and blood gases
• Assessment of level of consciousness.
• Two peripheral intravenous (IV) lines should be inserted.
The goal of therapy is to correct dehydration, correct acidosis, reverse ketosis, and gradually blood glucose concentration to near normal. Monitor for acute complications, and identify and treat any precipitating event.
Fluid replacement should always begin before starting insulin therapy. one or more boluses of
o.9% saline at 2o mL/kg are given to restore peripheral circulation. Insulin therapy with o.o5–o.1  U/kg/hr must begin at least 1 hour after starting fluid replacement therapy. Insulin of o.o5 U/kg/hr can be considered if pH is &gt; 7.15.
potassium replacement is given only when potassium is &lt;5.5 mmol/L. In rare cases
of hypokalemia with potassium &lt;3.o mmol/L, defer insulin treatment.
Bicarbonate administration is not recommended except for treatment of severe acidosis (pH &lt;
6.9) or in cases of life-threatening hyperkalemia.",,A,
Q3,which of the following is the best sign to indicate adequate growth in an infant with a birth weight of 2.8 kg?,"a)Increase in length of 25 centimeters in the first year
b)weight gain of 3oo grams per month till 1 year
c)Anterior fontanelle closure by 6 months of age
d)weight under 75th percentile and height under 25th percentile","The best sign to indicate adequate growth in an infant is an increase in length of 25 centimeters in the first year. The growth velocity is the rate of increase in height in one year and varies with age.  The average growth velocity is 25 cm/year in the first year (birth-12 months) and an infant will be   75 cm tall at 1 year. The height velocity is 1o cm/year from 12-24 months and at 2 years, the height is 9o cm. The height velocity is 8 cm/year from 24-36 months. At 4 years, the child is 1oo cm tall.  After this, the child gains about 6 cm every year until 12 years.



If growth velocity is lower than expected for age, the child is likely to be suffering from a pathological cause of short stature.
other options:
option B: During the first 3 months of age, the weight gain is about 2o-4o grams per day. From 4 months of age till 1 year of age, the weight gain is about 4oo grams per month. The weight of an    infant doubles his birth weight at 5 months of age and triples at 1 year of age and quadruples at 2  years of age.
option C: The anterior fontanelle closes by 18 months of age.
option D: According to WHo growth charts, weight under the 75th percentile and height under the 25th percentile do not indicate adequate growth.",,A,
Q4,A child is brought to the hospital with respiratory distress and biphasic stridor. The radiograph is shown below. what is the diagnosis?,"a)Acute epiglottitis
b)Acute laryngotracheobronchitis
c)Foreign body aspiration
d)Laryngomalacia","The diagnosis in this child with respiratory distress and biphasic stridor is
acute laryngotracheobronchitis, which is caused by the parainfluenza virus. The x-ray finding is the 'steeple sign' due to subglottic narrowing.
The age of presentation of laryngotracheobronchitis ranges from 6 months to 6 years. The clinical features include barking cough, inspiratory stridor, hoarseness, and low-grade fever.
Management:
• Racemic epinephrine nebulization leads to the rapid improvement of upper airway obstruction.   Epinephrine constricts pre-capillary arterioles in the upper airway mucosa and decreases capillary hydrostatic pressure, leading to fluid resorption and improvement in airway edema.
• Dexamethasone is administered by the least invasive route (oral &gt; IV &gt; IM ) for all the grades of croup.
• oxygen should be administered to children who are hypoxemic (spo2 &lt;92 %) Antibiotics are not indicated in acute laryngotracheobronchitis.
other options:
option A: Acute epiglottitis is a medical emergency presenting in children with a rapidly
progressive course of fever, sore throat, dyspnea, and respiratory obstruction, followed by a toxic appearance and drooling. The neck is hyperextended and stridor is a late finding. Radiography     shows a classic thumb sign.
option C: Foreign body aspiration initially presents with a paroxysm of cough, choking, and gagging, accompanied by new-onset wheezing and asymmetric breath sounds.
option D: Laryngomalacia is a congenital laryngeal anomaly presenting in children with low-pitched inspiratory stridor exacerbated by exertion.",5701-3626.PNG,B,
Q5,"A 3-month-old baby comes with complaints of deafness, cataract, and patent ductus arteriosus. which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","a)congenital herpes simplex virus infection
b)congenital toxoplasmosis
c)congenital cytomegalovirus infection
d)congenital rubella syndrome","The most likely diagnosis is congenital rubella syndrome based on the clinical findings.



Triad of Gregg is seen in babies with congenital rubella syndrome. The features include:
• patent ductus arteriosus (pDA)
• Cataract
• sensorineural Hearing loss (sNHL)
Rubella or German measles is a serious infection in pregnancy that causes abortions or severe
fetal defects if infection occurs in the first trimester. Transmission of the virus occurs through
nasopharyngeal secretions (droplet transmission). The mother usually has a fever and generalized  body rash. The rash is maculopapular in nature that begins from the face and spreads to the trunk and extremities later. The incidence and severity reduce as the pregnancy advances and is rare
after 2o weeks of gestation.
There is no specific treatment for rubella virus infection in mothers. post-exposure passive
immunization can be beneficial if given within 5 days of exposure to droplets. The incidence of this disease has reduced due to the availability of MMR vaccines. MMR vaccines can be
administered only to non-pregnant females as it is a live, attenuated virus. pregnancy should be avoided for at least 1 month after vaccination.
other options:
option A: Herpes simplex infection can be acquired in utero, intrapartum, or during the neonatal period. The intrauterine infection causes skin vesicles, eye findings (chorioretinitis,
keratoconjunctivitis), and microcephaly/hydranencephaly. Intrapartum infection presents with either:
• skin, eye, and mouth disease
• Encephalitis
• Disseminated disease with sepsis-like presentation
option B: Congenital toxoplasmosis occurs due to primary infection in immunologically normal pregnant women. First-trimester infection results in severe disease and third-trimester disease   result in milder disease. It presents with a triad of chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and
intracerebral calcifications.
option C: pregnant females infected with cytomegalovirus (CMV) present with infectious
mononucleosis-like symptoms, that is fever, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and polyarthritis.
Transmission to the fetus increases as pregnancy advances and is maximum in the third trimester. Congenital infection includes growth restriction, microcephaly, intracranial (periventricular)
calcifications, chorioretinitis, mental and motor deficits, hepatosplenomegaly, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura. Most infected neonates are asymptomatic at birth and later present   with these symptoms. sensorineural hearing loss is a common sequela of congenital CMV
infection.

Q6,chloride level in sweat is used in the diagnosis of which disease?,"a)phenylketonuria
b)cystic fibrosis
c)Gaucher's disease
d)osteogenesis imperfecta","The chloride level of sweat, known as the sweat test, is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF). A sweat chloride level of &gt;6o mmol/L is diagnostic of CF.
CF is an autosomal recessive disorder with a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7q.
The below image depicts the organs affected by CF:


Diagnostic tests include:
1. Immunoreactive trypsinogen for newborn screening of cystic fibrosis.
2. sweat chloride test: Increased chloride concentration &gt;6o mmol/L is diagnostic.
3. Genetic testing for CFTR gene mutations is the gold standard and should be done for all cases.
4. Nasal transepithelial potential difference can be estimated in equivocal cases. Diagnostic criteria:
presence of
• Clinical symptoms affecting at least one organ system (respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary) or



• positive newborn screening or
• A sibling with cystic fibrosis.
Evidence of dysfunction of the CFTR gene by
• Two positive sweat chloride test results obtained on separate days or
• Identification of two CFTR mutations by genetic testing or
• An abnormal measurement of nasal potential difference.
other options:
option A: phenylketonuria occurs due to the deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase, leading to elevated phenylalanine levels. Diagnosis is confirmed by measuring plasma phenylalanine
concentration.
option C: Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of β-glucosidase. Diagnosis is confirmed by fibroblast/leukocyte β-glucosidase activity and gene mutations.
option D: osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic connective tissue disorder due to defective type-1 collagen. DNA sequencing is the first diagnostic test.",,B,5701-3626-2.png
Q7,"A 3-month-old baby presents with jaundice and clay-colored stools. Lab investigation reveals that the baby has conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The liver biopsy shows periductal
proliferation. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)crigler-Najjar syndrome
b)Rotor syndrome
c)Dubin-Johnson syndrome
d)Biliary atresia","The most likely diagnosis in this infant with jaundice, clay-colored stools, and periductal proliferation is biliary atresia.
Biliary atresia presents with progressive jaundice, persistent acholic stools, and palpable liver with abnormal consistency. Laboratory investigations show conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
Ultrasonography reveals a triangular-cord sign (cone-shaped fibrotic mass cranial to the bifurcation of the portal vein).
HIDA test is used for screening and liver biopsy is diagnostic for biliary atresia. Biopsy shows     proliferation of the bile ductule, the presence of bile plugs, and portal or perilobular edema and fibrosis, with the basic hepatic lobular architecture intact.
other options:
option A: Crigler-Najjar type 2 is an autosomal recessive disease with non-hemolytic
unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia caused by homozygous missense mutations
in UGT1A1, resulting in reduced (partial) enzymatic activity.
option B: Rotor syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder presenting with asymptomatic mild and fluctuating conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with normal liver histology.
option C: Dubin-Johnson syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder due to the absent function of multiple drug-resistant protein-2.  It presents with abdominal pain, mild icterus, and
conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Biopsy shows black liver due to an accumulation of epinephrine metabolite.",,D,
Q8,"A child presents with fever and a rash spreading from the face, behind cheeks, and buccal mucosa to other body parts. on examination, koplik's spot is present. what is the likely    diagnosis?","a)Measles
b)Rubella
c)varicella
d)Mumps","The likely diagnosis is measles based on the clinical symptoms and the presence of koplik spots.
koplik spots are discrete red lesions with central bluish-white spots seen on the buccal mucosa at the level of premolars.
The measles virus has an incubation period of 8-12 days, after which the prodrome phase begins    with mild fever, conjunctivitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and pathognomic koplik spots.    This follows the appearance of maculopapular rash after 4th day of fever, which begins at the face and spreads to the torso and extremities. Lymphadenopathy may be present. Treatment is
supportive. The most common complication of measles is acute otitis media.
The image below shows koplik spots.


other options:
option B: Rubella presents with low-grade fever, centrifugal macular rash, and prominent
lymphadenopathy (suboccipital, postauricular, and anterior cervical lymph nodes). Forchheimer spots (tiny rose-colored lesions on the soft palate) may be present.
The image below shows Forchheimer spots.





option C: Varicella presents with fever, malaise, and anorexia, followed by a pruritic    maculopapular rash, which forms vesicles with a characteristic ""cropping"" distribution (simultaneous presence of lesions in various stages of evolution).
option D: Mumps presents with fever, headache, parotitis, and ipsilateral auricular pain. A morbilliform rash may occur.",,A,5710-3627.PNG;5711-3628.PNG

b)congenital herpes simplex virus infection
c)congenital toxoplasmosis
d)congenital cytomegalovirus infection","The most likely diagnosis in this infant is congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
The clinical manifestations are hepatosplenomegaly, petechial rashes, jaundice, chorioretinitis,
and microcephaly. Head neuroimaging shows intracranial periventricular calcifications. one of
the long-term sequelae is sensorineural hearing loss. Diagnosis is made by isolating the virus from the urine or blood by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
There is no definitive treatment for congenital CMV infection. Treatment with ganciclovir
is indicated only in patients with progressive neurologic disease and deafness. The images below show periventricular calcifications and a blueberry muffin baby.






other options:
option A - congenital rubella syndrome is due to the rubella virus. The classical triad of
congenital rubella syndrome is deafness, cataract, and congenital heart disease. patent ductus   arteriosus is a common cardiac defect. Eye findings also include salt and pepper retinopathy as shown below.





option B - Herpes simplex infection in neonates presents with skin vesicles, eye
findings (chorioretinitis, keratoconjunctivitis), and microcephaly/hydranencephaly. It can also present as localized skin, eye, and mouth disease, encephalitis, or disseminated disease with a sepsis-like presentation.
option C - Congenital toxoplasmosis is due to Toxoplasma gondii. A classic triad of
chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and intracerebral calcifications is seen. Blueberry muffin baby
appearance is also seen in this. Calcifications occur randomly throughout the brain in congenital toxoplasmosis while periventricular calcification is characteristic of congenital CMV infection.",,D,5572-3551.PNG;5573-3553.PNG;5713-3630.PNG
