Q8,Choose the correct statement regarding CMV.,"a)Ganciclovir resistance is due to mutation in UL97 phosphotransferase gene
b)CMV can be cultured in vitro in any mammalian cell
c)Commonest manifestation of CMV associated disease is watery diarrhea
d)UL54 mutated CMV strains do not show cross resistance to foscarnet","Resistance to ganciclovir most commonly occurs due to mutations in the UL97
phosphotransferase gene.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a beta-herpes virus. It is the most common congenital infection. In
adults, its disease is mostly subclinical (option C). An apparent CMV infection resembles
infectious mononucleosis (fever, sore throat, enlarged lymph nodes and splenomegaly). It is the   most common infection in the donor organ seen 1-4 months after solid organ transplantation. In immunosuppressed hosts, it causes pneumonia and colitis.
Diagnosis is by PCR assays. Human CMV replicates in vitro only in human fibroblasts (option B) and can thus be cultured in them, although the virus is often isolated from epithelial cells of the  host. The cultured fibroblasts show owl-eye inclusion bodies after 2-3 weeks.
UL54 (DNA polymerase) gene mutations can confer CMV resistance to ganciclovir, cidofovir and foscarnet (option D).",,A,

Q11,Identify the organism below that causes effacement and attachment of intestinal cells.,"a)ETEC
b)EIEC
c)EPEC
d)EAEC","Attachment and effacement lesions on intestinal cells are caused by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC).
E. coli is the second most common cause of diarrhea in the pediatric age group. Rotavirus is the most common cause. EPEC causes watery diarrhea which is self-limiting.
EPEC adheres to the mucosal cells of the small bowel and causes loss of microvilli (effacement). This leads to the formation of filamentous actin pedestals or cuplike structures and occasionally may cause entry of the EPEC into the mucosal cells.
Pathogenicity requires the presence of two important factors:
•  Bundle-forming pilus encoded by plasmid containing EPEC adherence factor (EAF).
•  Chromosomal locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island.

Q12,which of the following organisms is represented by the given form of replication?,"a)Hepatitis virus
b)Influenza virus
c)HIV
d)Herpes virus","The given image shows generation of mRNA from negative sense RNA within the nucleus. This occurs during the replication of influenza virus.
orthomyxoviruses (influenza virus) contain segmented (8 segments) negative sense ssRNA that is replicated in the nucleus. stages of viral replication include the following:
• Attachment, penetration, uncoating: The virus attaches to cell-surface sialic acid via
hemagglutinin. It is then internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. There is fusion of the
viral envelope and cell membrane, resulting in uncoating or release of nucleocapsid into the host cell cytoplasm.
• Transcription and translation:  mRNAs are produced from nucleocapsids via a virus-encoded polymerase. This process occurs in the nucleus. The mRNAs thus produced are translated into viral proteins in the cytoplasm.
• viral RNA replication: The viral genome is replicated by the same virus-encoded polymerase involved in transcription. The negative sense RNA is converted to its positive sense form. The positive sense copies serve as templates for replication of the viral genome.
• Maturation: The virus matures by budding from the surface of the cell.",1365-827.PNG,B,
Q13,which method of diagnosis is shown in the image?,"a)Darkfield microscopy
b)phase contrast microscopy
c)Fluorescent microscopy
d)Electron microscopy","The given image is of darkfield microscopy as it has a dark background with a refractile organism.

Q14,Identify the helminth from the life cycle given below.,"a)Ancylostoma duodenale
b)strongyloides stercoralis
c)Ascaris lumbricoides
d)Enterobius vermicularis","The image shows the life cycle of strongyloides stercoralis.
strongyloides stercoralis is the smallest nematode known to cause human infection. It has both a free-living and a parasitic life cycle. Its natural host is man. The infective form to man is the
filariform larva. Infection occurs through penetration of the skin by larvae in the soil. Then, the
larvae migrate to the small intestine. They molt twice and become adult female worms in the
small intestine. The eggs laid in the mucosa of the intestine hatch immediately releasing the
rhabditiform larva (L1 stage). Thus, it is ovoviviparous. These rhabditiform larvae in the bowel can develop directly into filariform larvae that penetrate the colonic wall or perianal skin and enter
the circulation to repeat the migration. This establishes ongoing internal reinfection.
The rhabditiform larva can also be passed in the stool. It may directly metamorphose to the
infective filariform larva in the soil, or develop into adult worms. The free-living adult worms then pass eggs, which hatch and mature to form infective filariform larvae.
In Ancylostoma duodenale infestation, eggs containing segmented ova (not rhabditiform larvae)   are passed in the stool. The rhabditiform larva hatches 2 days after the eggs are passed in the soil.
Note: Based on the method of reproduction, nematodes are classified as follows:
• oviparous - They lay eggs:
• unsegmented eggs: Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichuria
• segmented eggs:  Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus
• Eggs containing larva: Enterobius vermicularis
• viviparous - They produce larvae. e.g., Trichinella spiralis, wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi
• ovoviviparous – They lay eggs containing fully formed larvae that hatch immediately. e.g., strongyloides stercoralis",1367-830.PNG,B,

Q17,The following image depicts:,"a)production of monoclonal antibodies
b)cell lines for viral culture
c)vaccine synthesis
d)process of genetic engineering","The image depicts the production of monoclonal antibodies by hybridoma technology.
The following are the steps involved in hybridoma technology:
• Mice are immunized with an antigen. After several weeks of immunization, blood samples are obtained from mice for measurement of serum antibodies.
• when the antibody titer is high enough, mice are commonly boosted by injecting antigen,   without adjuvant, intraperitoneally or intravenously. Then the mice are euthanized and their spleens removed for in vitro hybridoma cell production.
• Fusing antibody-producing spleen cells, which have a limited life span, with myeloma cells (derived from an immortal tumor of lymphocytes) results in a hybridoma that is capable of   unlimited growth.
• The cells are cultured in a medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium) which allows only the fused cells to survive in culture.
• Monoclonal antibodies are then harvested.",1368-831.PNG,A,1380-840.PNG

Q20,"A patient's plasma has high levels of interferon beta. He most likely has an infection due to
_____","a)virus
b)Bacteria
c)Fungi
d)Mycoplasma","Interferon-beta is secreted during infection due to viruses.
Interferons are classified as cytokines. Interferons are non-toxic, non-antigenic and
species-specific molecules. They are inactivated by proteases. They are stable at pH over 2-1o, except INF-? (labile at pH 2) and are non-dialysable and non-sedimentable.
There are three types of interferons - a , ß and ?. IFN-a or leukocyte interferon is produced by
leucocytes. It has antiviral activity, is immunoregulaotry and antiproliferative. IFN-ß or fibroblast interferon is produced by fibroblasts and epithelial cells. It has antiviral activity and is thus
increased in viral infections. It enhances MHC class 1 and NK cell activity. IFN-? or immune
interferon is produced by T-lymphocytes, NK cells . It activates macrophages, increases neutrophil function, enhances both MHC class 1 and class II expression and has anti-proliferative
(anti-tumour) functions.",,A,
Q21,which of the following is the most potent stimulator of naive T-cells?,"a)Mature dendritic cells
b)Follicular dendritic cells
c)B lymphocytes
d)NK cells","Mature dendritic cells are the most potent stimulator of naive T cells.
Naive CD4+ T cells are activated when they come in contact with two ligands - MHC class II and a costimulary membrane protein (eg: CD28). Both of these are present in antigen-presenting cells,    the most potent of which is the mature dendritic cell. other professional antigen-presenting cells   include macrophages and B lymphocytes (option C).
other options:

option B: Follicular dendritic cells are functionally different from dendritic cells. They are not antigen-presenting-cells and do not activate naive T cells.
option D: NK cells do not stimulate naive T cells.",,A,1382-841.PNG
Q22,which of the following is an immunologically privileged site?,"a)seminiferous tubule
b)Area postrema
c)optic nerve
d)Loop of Henle","The seminiferous tubules are an immunologically privileged site.
Immunologically privileged sites can tolerate the introduction of antigens without eliciting an  immune response. This allows a higher likelihood of graft survival, even without perfect HLA   matching. As a result, an allograft can be placed in these sites without endangering a rejection reaction.
The unique immune tolerance in these regions is primarily due to the lack of effective lymphatic drainage, which prevents antigen presentation to the immune system, and the presence of
blood-tissue barriers that restrict immune cell infiltration. Low vascularity contributes to immune privilege by minimising antigen exposure and immune cell recruitment.
Examples of immune-privileged sites are the anterior chamber of the eye, cornea, testes, and brain.
Note: Although part of the brain, the blood-brain barrier is absent at the area postrema, therefore it is not an immune-privileged site.",,A,
Q23,Bone marrow aspirate of a patient shows the following features. which of the following is true?,"a)Buffy coat is used to diagnose the parasite
b)It is an obligate extracellular parasite
c)It is transmitted from sheep
d)stibogluconate is the first line of treatment in India.","The given image shows the amastigote form of leishmaniasis located intracellularly in
macrophages. Buffy coat is used to diagnose the parasite.
visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) is a slowly progressing indigenous disease caused by a
protozoan parasite of genus Leishmania. Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disorder transmitted by the

bite of an infected female phlebotomus sandfly in developing countries. The disease is transmitted by sand flies, which inoculate the flagellated promastigotes into the skin of the host.
In human beings, the disease presents in four different forms with a broad range of clinical manifestation:
• Visceral leishmaniasis, or kala-azar,
• cutaneous leishmaniasis,
• Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, and
• Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis.
The life cycle of Leishmania involves two forms,
• The promastigote which develops and lives extracellularly in the sandfly vector and
• The amastigote which multiplies intracellularly in the reticuloendothelial cells of the host.
It lowers immunity, causes persistent fever, anemia, liver and spleen enlargement, and if left untreated, death may occur due to opportunistic infection.
Diagnosis:
• Rapid diagnostic test: rk39 Rapid diagnostic test and kala azar dipstick test strip.
• parasitological diagnosis: Demonstration of LD bodies in buffy coat smear - confirmatory.
• Aldehyde test of Napier: widely used for surveillance.
• serological tests for diagnosis: Rapid dipstick test, Direct agglutination test, ELIsA, Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test
• Leishmanin (Montenegro) test: Induration of 5mm or more is considered positive, usually      positive 4-6 weeks after onset in cutaneous leishmaniasis, valuable for distinguishing immune from nonimmune subjects and endemicity.
Drugs used in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis are sodium stibogluconate, miltefosine, and amphotericin. Liposomal amphotericin single dose 1omg/kg IV is the first line of treatment in
India.",1370-832.PNG,A,
Q24,which of the following drugs is not used for typhoid fever in adults?,"a)Azithromycin
