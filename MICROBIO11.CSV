Q1,"A photographer who recently returned from Africa presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and hemorrhagic manifestations. He died despite
treatment, and an autopsy revealed intranuclear Torres bodies in the liver. which of the following vaccines could have prevented it?","a)17D
b)Nakayama vaccine
c)weiglls vaccine
d)Jeryl Lynn strain","The above clinical vignette is suggestive of yellow fever and the use of 17D vaccine could have prevented this.
17D vaccine is a live-attenuated vaccine administered through the subcutaneous route. It is
contraindicated in infants less than 9 months of age, in pregnancy, and in individuals with egg allergy.
yellow fever is caused by flavivirus and is endemic to certain parts of Africa and America. It
occurs in two patterns: the urban cycle and the sylvatic cycle. Aedes aegypti is the vector in the urban cycle, while Aedes africanus is responsible for transmission in the sylvatic cycle.
patients present with acute onset fever, headache, and vomiting. Jaundice and hemorrhagic manifestations can also be present. ultimately, hepatic or renal failure can result in death.
Torres bodies are intranuclear eosinophilic inclusion bodies in hepatocytes. These are rarely seen in yellow fever. To prevent the establishment of the disease in India, strict vaccination and
quarantine protocols for travelers from endemic areas are enforced.
other options:
option B: Nakayama vaccine is used for immunization against Japanese encephalitis. Culex
tritaeniorhynchus is the principal vector. There is a sudden onset of fever and vomiting, which
later progresses to encephalitis. In India, it was first reported in vellore and continues to be active in the country.
option C: weigl's vaccine is the earliest used vaccine against epidemic typhus caused by Rickettsia prowazekii. The main foci of the disease are Europe, Africa, south America, and Asia. kashmir is   the endemic spot in India. pediculus humanus corporis (human body louse) is the vector.
symptoms include fever and chills. A characteristic rash on the trunk and limbs, sparing the face, palms, and soles, may also be seen.
option D: Jeryl-Lynn strain of the mumps virus is used against the disease as a live-attenuated vaccine. It is contraindicated in pregnancy and individuals allergic to eggs. Mumps present as   parotid swelling associated with fever and tenderness.",,A,
Q2,"A militant presents with rashes all over his body sparing the palms and soles. on
examination, he was febrile and lice were noted. which of the following is responsible for his condition?","a)Rickettsia typhi
b)Rickettsia prowazekii
c)Rickettsia akari
d)Rickettsia conorii","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of epidemic or louse-borne typhus caused by Rickettsia prowazekii.
pediculus corporis (human body louse) is the vector for the parasite, although the head louse may also transmit the disease. After the incubation period of 5 - 15 days, the disease typically starts
with fever and chills. By around 4 - 5th day of fever, a characteristic rash appears, which starts on the trunk and spreads over the limbs but spares the face, palms, and soles.
The infection can be transmitted by
• Contaminated louse feces rubbed through abrasions caused by scratching
• Inhalation of aerosols of dried louse feces or directly through the conjunctiva
The disease is often severe with the fever lasting for over 2 weeks and is more fatal in patients older than 4o years of age.
other options:
option A: R. typhi causes murine (flea-borne) or endemic typhus. Rats are the reservoirs of
infection and the parasite is transmitted by xenopsylla cheopis (flea). The infection is transmitted when the flea feces is rubbed into the bite wound. The clinical features are similar to that of
epidemic typhus but are milder and rarely fatal. patients can present with fever, headache, myalgia, and rash.
option C: R. akari causes rickettsial pox, which is a mild disease resembling varicella. The disease is transmitted by mites and the patients may present with fever, headache, and a vesicular rash.
option D: R. conorii causes the Mediterranean spotted fever. The parasite is transmitted by ticks and the patients present with fever, headache, rash, and eschar (tache noire).",,B,
Q3,Microfilariae with sheathed tail and two nuclei at the tail tip is suggestive of?,"a)wuchereria bancrofti
b)Brugia malayi
c)Loa loa
d)onchocerca volvulus","The most likely organism based on the description of the microfilariae is Brugia malayi.
The microfilariae of B. malayi are sheathed and have kinks and secondary curves. The tail tip has two nuclei - a terminal and a subterminal one. It has nocturnal periodicity.
The female filarial worms, which belong to the phylum Nematoda, give birth to larvae known as microfilariae. some of the microfilariae retain their egg membranes and are known as sheathed  microfilariae. They can be further differentiated on the basis of the arrangement of nuclei in the tail.



classical filariasis is due to obstruction of lymphatics by the adult worms resulting in lymph
stasis. This leads to leakage of lymph into the tissues causing hard pitting (brawny) edema. It can present as acute adenolymphangitis, hydrocele, or elephantiasis which is shown below.


occult filariasis (Meyers-kouwenaar syndrome) results from a hypersensitivity reaction to the
microfilarial antigens. Here, the microfilariae are not found in the blood. symptoms include
hepatosplenomegaly, nocturnal cough, or arthritis. Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia is a
manifestation of occult filariasis which presents as low-grade fever, weight loss, and dry nocturnal cough. There is marked eosinophilia and raised serum IgE levels. It is managed with
diethylcarbamazine.
other options:
option A - Microfilariae of wuchereria bancrofti are sheathed and the tail tip lacks nuclei. It has nocturnal periodicity.

option c - Loa loa causes subcutaneous filariasis which presents as swellings on the extremities
(calabar/fugitive swellings). It can also cause conjunctival granulomas and proptosis. The nuclei are arranged in a row up to the tail tip of the sheathed microfilariae. It exhibits diurnal
periodicity.
option D - onchocerca volvulus (blinding filaria) causes onchocerciasis. The microfilariae are unsheathed and the nuclei do not extend to the tail tip. patients present with subcutaneous     nodules (onchocercoma), dermatitis, photophobia, or even blindness. It is non-periodic.",,B,1636-1039.PNG;1636-1038.PNG
Q4,"A patient presents with cervical lymphadenopathy and is found to be retropositive. A fungal culture depicts a velvety growth with red diffusible pigment on the underside, as shown
below. which is the most likely causative organism?","a)Talaromyces marneffei
b)Blastomyces
c)Aspergillus
d)pneumocystis jirovecii","The most likely causative organism based on the history and image given is Talaromyces marneffei (penicillium marneffei).
T. marneffei is a dimorphic fungus that causes talaromycosis (penicilliosis). It is commonly seen in individuals with advanced AIDS. It is diagnosed by blood culture, which shows a mold with a powdery surface and characteristic red pigment that diffuses into the agar. Histopathological
examination reveals yeast-like organisms with central septation.
clinical features include fever, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly.
umbilicated papules that resemble molluscum contagiosum may also be seen.
Mild and moderate infections can be treated with itraconazole. Amphotericin B is recommended for severe infections.
other options:
option B - Blastomyces are thermally dimorphic fungi and cause blastomycosis. primary infection usually affects the lungs, which can later disseminate through the blood to form multiple
abscesses at sites such as skin and bone. culture at 25–3o degrees celsius promotes hyphal
growth. Microscopic examination of stained specimens shows broad-based budding yeast cells.
option c - Aspergillus colonies have a velvety powdery surface, of which the color varies according to the species. Aspergillus fumigatus is seen as dark green colonies, while Aspergillus niger
appears black colored. yellow-green growth is seen in the case of Aspergillus flavus. on
microscopy, dichotomous branching at acute angles seen after staining is characteristic. It can cause invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients.
The image below shows Aspergillus niger colonies.



option D - pneumocystis jirovecii cannot be cultured. on being stained by methenamine silver, the cyst wall appears black under the microscope. Trophozoites can also be seen after staining.
clinical features include dyspnea, fever, and cough. It can cause lethal pneumonia in
immunocompromised individuals. Diffuse bilateral perihilar interstitial infiltrates can be seen on chest radiograph.",1630-1035.PNG,A,1638-1041.PNG;1638-1040.PNG
Q5,"A patient presents with itching in the axilla. on microscopic examination of the skin
scrapings, a red pigment-producing fungus with pencil-shaped macroconidia is seen. which of the following is the most likely organism?","a)Trichophyton violaceum
b)Trichophyton rubrum
c)Trichophyton tonsurans
d)Trichophyton schoenleinii","The most likely organism based on the given history and image is Trichophyton rubrum. The colonies appear velvety and a deep red, non-diffusible pigment is seen when viewed from
the reverse side of the colony. A few long and pencil-shaped macroconidia can be seen.
Trichophyton is a dermatophytic fungi that can infect hair, skin, or nails. Dermatophytes infect only the keratinized tissue and have keratinases that can digest keratin. There are 3 genera of

dermatophytes:
• Trichophyton - The colonies may appear powdery, waxy, or velvety with pigmentation characteristics of different species.
• Epidermophyton - It infects the skin and nails, but not the hair. The colonies appear powdery and greenish-yellow.
• Microsporum - It infects the hair and skin, but not the nails. The colonies may appear cotton-like, velvety, or powdery, with white to brown pigmentation.
T. rubrum causes tinea corporis.  It results from the invasion and proliferation of the causal fungi in the stratum corneum, with lesions on the trunk and limbs. The lesions are usually well-defined and circular with a raised edge. It can also cause tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and onychomycosis.


other options:
option A: The colonies of T. violaceus are very slow-growing, waxy with a violet/purple pigment. They have distorted hyphae, with conidia seen rarely.


option C: T. tonsurans has a cream or yellowish colony with central furrows. Microconidia are abundantly seen. Thick-walled, irregular macroconidia are also seen.


option D: Colonies of T. schoenleinii are smooth, waxy and brownish. Hyphal swellings are seen along with chlamydospores and favic chandelier.",1631-1036.PNG,B,1639-1043.PNG;1639-1042.PNG;1640-1045.PNG;1640-1044.PNG
Q6,A female patient presents with complaints of thick white vaginal secretions. which of the following can be used to identify the likely species of the causative agent?,"a)Bird seed agar
b)Brain heart infusion agar
c)CHROMagar
d)sabouraud dextrose agar","The clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of candidiasis. CHRoMagar can be used for the rapid identification of Candida species. It is based on the fungal enzymatic action on various
chromogenic substrates in the medium.

After incubation on CHROMagar for 1–4 days, colonies are seen: Candida albicans colonies appear green, as shown below; Candida glabrata colonies appear dark purple; and Candida  parapsilosis colonies have a pinkish hue.


The most common species implicated in candidal infections are C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. glabrata. vaginal mucosal invasion by the organism causes vulvovaginitis, marked by pruritus
and vaginal discharge. A white pseudomembranous patchy lesion called thrush can occur on the tongue, lips, or gums.


Immunocompromised individuals are at an increased risk of systemic candidiasis, which includes candidal endocarditis and urinary tract infections.
It appears as budding gram-positive cells on wet films and smears. Mycelial forms suggest colonization. Candida albicans, the most commonly implicated pathogenic species
form chlamydospores on corn meal agar.
The image below shows candidal hyphae and chlamydospores.



Mucocutaneous manifestations are managed with topical nystatin or oral ketoconazole.
other options:
options A and B: Bird seed agar and brain heart infusion agar are non-specific media used in fungal culture.
option D: sabouraud dextrose agar is the traditional mycological medium, which contains glucose and modified peptones. It supports the growth of fungi, while restricting bacterial growth due to    the addition of antibacterials.",,C,1641-1047.PNG;1641-1046.PNG;1642-1048.PNG
Q7,"A 12-year-old boy presents with right upper quadrant pain, calf pain, conjunctival suffusion, icterus, and fever. Examination shows tender hepatomegaly. what is the most likely
diagnosis?","a)Chikungunya
b)Leptospirosis
c)Dengue hemorrhagic fever
d)Encephalopathy caused by hepatitis A","The most likely diagnosis based on the clinical vignette is leptospirosis.
Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. patients with mild
disease may present with flu-like symptoms of sudden onset, fever with chills, headache,
abdominal pain, conjunctival suffusion, and myalgia. The muscle pain usually affects the calves, abdomen, and back. Mild cases can be treated with oral doxycycline, ampicillin, or amoxicillin.
severe leptospirosis is rapidly progressive and is associated with high fatality. The classic
presentation of the severe disease called weil’s syndrome includes the triad of hemorrhage, jaundice, and acute kidney injury. Jaundice when present can be profound and physical
examination may reveal an enlarged, tender liver. Temperature-pulse dissociation /relative bradycardia can be seen. Moderate to severe cases are treated with intravenous penicillin,  ampicillin, or ceftriaxone.
The image below shows icterus and conjunctival suffusion in a patient with leptospirosis.




Leptospira are actively motile organisms and are best seen using a dark-field microscope. They are thin, tightly coiled, and flexible spirochetes with one end forming a hook. Diagnosis is by
microscopic agglutination test.
Transmission occurs through cuts or breaks in the skin and mucous membranes (conjunctival and oral mucosa). several outbreaks have been reported that resulted from exposure to floodwaters
contaminated by urine from infected animals. The organism enters the bloodstream and lodges in the parenchymatous organs (liver and kidneys) leading to hemorrhage and necrosis of the tissue    causing dysfunction of the organs.
The lifecycle of Leptospira is shown below.



Illness is classically biphasic after an incubation period of up to 1 month. The stages are:
• Acute leptospiremic phase- the organism can be cultured from blood.
• Resolving immune phase- the organism can be cultured from urine.
The stages may not be clinically distinguishable.
other options:
option A - Chikungunya is a viral disease that presents with saddle-back fever, conjunctival
suffusion, and photophobia. Migratory arthralgia, especially involving small joints may also be seen. A maculopapular or petechial rash is frequently seen on the trunk.
option C - Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a form of severe dengue with bleeding manifestations. Evidence of plasma leakage and thrombocytopenia is also generally seen.
option D - Encephalitis due to Hepatitis A is seen in fulminant hepatitis, a rare complication.

Q8,A newly joined teacher develops rice water stools. The causative agent acts on which of the following receptors?,"a)GM1 ganglioside receptor
b)GM2 ganglioside receptor
c)sphingomyelin
d)cerebroganglioside","The given clinical scenario of rice-water stools is suggestive of cholera, caused by vibrio cholerae. The toxin produced by the organism acts on GM1 ganglioside receptors.
vibrio cholerae is a comma-shaped, gram-negative bacillus with darting motility. It has a single polar flagellum. It causes cholera, an acute diarrheal disease. It is marked by painless, profuse,  watery diarrhea with flecks of mucus (rice water stools) associated with effortless vomiting.
pulmonary edema and arrhythmias are some of the complications.
Infection is acquired by ingestion of contaminated food and water. The organisms produce an
enterotoxin known as cholera toxin (CT). It has 1 A and 5 B subunits. The B subunit (binding
units) fixes to the GM1 ganglioside receptors on jejunal epithelial cells. The A subunit dissociates into the A2 fragment, which attaches the A1 fragment to the B subunit. This results in prolonged accumulation of cAMp, which causes an outpouring of large amounts of water and electrolytes

into the intestinal lumen. ultimately, it results in profuse watery diarrhea.
In addition to the cholera toxin, additional toxins such as zona occludens toxin and accessory cholera toxin are also produced. The former alters intestinal permeability by its action on
intestinal epithelial cells.
The characteristic darting mobility and its hindrance by antiserum can be used for rapid microscopic diagnosis.
Fluid resuscitation by rice-based oRS is recommended. Medical management includes
erythromycin or azithromycin.",,A,
Q9,which of the following is considered to be the best for the detection of clostridium difficile?,"a)Aerobic culture of stool
b)Glutamate dehydrogenase and toxin assay
c)Glutamate dehydrogenase assay
d)None of the above","A combination of glutamate dehydrogenase and toxin assay can be used for the detection of clostridium difficile.
clostridium difficile is a gram-positive anaerobic bacillus that causes clostridioides
(formerly clostridium) difficile infection after ingestion of spores of the organism. The more
severe form of the condition is known as pseudomembranous colitis (PMc). Enzyme
immunoassay to detect glutamate dehydrogenase is less specific compared to toxin detection for diagnosis. So a combination of the two can be used for diagnostic confirmation.
The condition is most commonly associated with prolonged antimicrobial use, which interferes with the commensal colonic microflora. The most commonly implicated antibiotics
are cephalosporins, ampicillin, and clindamycin. The spores are spread by contact with
the feces of affected individuals or asymptomatic carriers. It can persist on surfaces for months. Risk factors include poor hand hygiene, old age, and gastrointestinal surgery.
The spores germinate in the small intestine and produce two toxins—toxin A (enterotoxin)
and toxin B (cytotoxin). These interfere with the epithelial-cell barrier function and result in
diarrhea and pseudomembrane formation. The pseudomembranes appear as small whitish-yellow plaques initially which later coalesce to involve the entire colon wall. It contains necrotic
leukocytes, fibrin, and cellular debris. The anamnestic IgG response determines which patients develop the disease or remain asymptomatic.
Symptoms include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical criteria and detection of toxin or the organism in stool samples. This can be done
by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PcR) or by culture.
Discontinuation of any ongoing antimicrobials and adequate hydration are general measures that  are recommended. oral fidaxomicin or vancomycin is the first-line treatment. oral metronidazole can be used when these are not available.
other options:
option A: Aerobic culture of stool is the most sensitive test and is highly specific. It is not used practically as the turnaround time is slow.",,B,
Q10,"A diabetic truck driver presents to you with cough and breathlessness. A diagnosis of pneumonia was confirmed, and histopathological examination revealed dichotomous branching, as shown below. what is the likely causative agent?","a)Rhizopus
b)Mucor
c)candida
d)Aspergillus","The most likely causative agent based on the clinical features and image showing dichotomous branching at acute angles given is Aspergillus.
Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common pathogenic species. It can cause invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. This can be due to prolonged treatment with steroids or
retro-positive status. It starts as pneumonia, which can later spread to involve other organs.
voriconazole is the drug of choice.
other manifestations include allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis where central
bronchiectasis is usually seen. Aspergilloma and superficial infections like otomycosis or mycotic keratitis are the other presentations.
Histopathological examination of the tissue section shows characteristic dichotomous branching at an acute angle. The hyphae stain poorly with hematoxylin and eosin, so periodic acid–Schiff    (PAS) stain is used.
other methods for diagnosis include detection of galactomannan (Aspergillus cell-wall
component) and culture isolation. Aspergillus fumigatus grows dark green colonies, while     Aspergillus niger appears black. yellow-green colonies are seen in case of Aspergillus flavus.
Microscopic examination of colonies stained with lactophenol cotton blue would show septate hyphae and conidiophores.
other options:
options A and B - Rhizopus and Mucor are zygomycetes that are responsible for mucormycosis. Non-septate, broad hyphae are seen on tissue samples stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
The image below shows broad aseptate and irregularly-branched non-septate hyphae of Mucor.


option c - candida, the causative agent for candidiasis, appear as budding gram-positive cells on  wet films and smears. Mycelial forms suggest colonization. culture colonies are creamy-white and have a yeasty odor. candida albicans, the most commonly implicated pathogenic species, form
chlamydospores on corn meal agar.

Q11,A woman with recurrent diarrhea is prescribed a broad-spectrum antibiotic. which of the following is not true regarding clostridium difficile infection?,"a)oral fidaxomicin is used for treatment
b)It is toxin mediated
c)IgM assay is used to confirm the diagnosis
d)pseudomembrane consists of leukocytes, fibrin, and cellular debris","IgM assay cannot be used to confirm a diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical criteria and detection of toxin or the organism in stool samples.
C. difficile, a gram-positive anaerobic bacillus, causes Clostridioides
