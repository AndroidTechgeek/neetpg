Q1,"A 25-year-old patient presents with fever and weight loss. He gives a history of blood in the stools and vomiting 2 weeks ago. on examination, there is right hypochondriac tenderness  and hepatomegaly. Abdominal CT a lesion in the right lobe of the liver with ragged edges,   multiple septations, and heterogenous densities. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)pyogenic liver abscess
b)Hydatid cyst
c)Amoebic liver abscess
d)Hemangioma","Features of fever, hepatomegaly, and hypochondriac tenderness are suggestive of a liver abscess.   A liver abscess in a patient with a history of blood in the stools and vomiting points to a diagnosis of amoebic liver abscess.
Amoebic liver abscess is more common in males in the age group of 2o - 4o years with a history of travel to endemic areas. Ingestion of Entamoeba histolytica cysts causes diarrhea initially.
Following this, the trophozoites reach the liver through the portal venous system and cause an
amebic liver abscess. 8o% of the cases involve the right lobe. The clinical features of amoebic liver abscess are right upper quadrant pain, tenderness, fever, hepatomegaly, and diarrhea.
Enzyme immunoassays detecting the presence of antibodies against the parasite have high
sensitivity and specificity. ultrasonography and CT scans can visualize the liver abscess without a peripheral rim of enhancement.






The mainstay of treatment for amebic abscesses is metronidazole, which is curative in more than 9o% of patients. Luminal agents such as diloxanide furoate can be administered to treat the
carrier state. Aspiration of abscess is recommended in case of a high risk of rupture. pigtail     catheter drainage is done in patients not responding to intravenous metronidazole in the first 48–72 hours to improve antibiotic penetration.
option A: pyogenic liver abscess is usually seen after 5o years of age and is not associated with a history of travel or diarrhea. Jaundice, bacteremia, and positive blood cultures are common in
pyogenic liver abscesses compared to amoebic liver abscesses. Serology testing for Entamoeba is negative. A characteristic rim enhancement is noted in the case of a pyogenic abscess on a CECT abdomen and can differentiate it from an amoebic liver abscess.


option B: Hydatid cyst a zoonotic infection caused by the Echinococcus species of flatworms. primary hydatid cysts most commonly occur in the liver. Most patients are asymptomatic but when symptomatic, the patient presents with hepatomegaly, pain, and obstructive jaundice.
The rupture of a hydatic cyst can result in fever, pruritus, or anaphylaxis. Imaging findings are cystic lesion with multiple daughter cysts within, detachment of the endocyst membrane
(water-lily sign on USG shown below), and areas of calcification.





option D: Hemangiomas are more common in women and are usually asymptomatic. Larger
hemangiomas may present with vague upper abdominal symptoms. on contrast-enhanced CT    scan, hemangiomas show asymmetrical, nodular peripheral enhancement that is isodense, with large vessels and progressive centripetal enhancement.",,C,5084-3177.PNG;5085-3178.PNG;5048-3164-3.png;5084-3177-1.png
Q2,which of the following tests is done before performing an A-v fistula procedure? The image of the test is given below.,"a)Allen's test
b)Adson's test
c)Elevated arm stress test
d)Nicoladoni's test","The image is suggestive of Allen's Test. It is usually done prior to radial artery cannulation
and performing an A-v fistula procedure to test the adequacy of ulnar collateral blood flow to the hand.
Allen's test is performed by occluding the radial and ulnar arteries. The patient is asked to make a tight fist so as to exsanguinate the palm. Then the patient is asked to open the hand and the
occlusion over the ulnar artery is released. As occlusion of the ulnar artery is released, the color of



the open palm is observed. Normally, the color will return to the palm within 5 – 6 seconds. If the palm remains pale for more than 6-1o seconds, it indicates reduced ulnar collateral flow. The
modified Allen’s test considers a threshold of 5-15 seconds.


In recent years, studies have shown that, although the Allen test is often used to identify patients   at increased risk for ischemic complications from radial artery cannulation, the predictive value of this test is poor. It is also used for identifying patients acceptable for radial artery harvest or use     for coronary angiography.
other options:
option B: Adson's test is a provocative maneuver for thoracic outlet syndrome. The test is
performed by extending the patient’s neck and turning the head towards the affected side while     they breathe in deeply. This compresses the interscalene space and will result in paraesthesia and obliteration of the radial pulse.
option C: Elevated arm stress test or Roos test is a provocative test for the diagnosis of thoracic
outlet syndrome. For this test, the patient abducts the shoulders to 9o degrees and flexes the
elbow to 9o degrees. The patient is made to open and close the hand slowly for three minutes. The test is positive if the patient is unable to complete the test or experiences cramping, pain,
or numbness on the affected side.
option D: The reflex bradycardia and increase in blood pressure that immediately follows the sudden occlusion of an arteriovenous (A-v) fistula is known as the Nicoladoni-Branham sign.",5073-3171.PNG,A,5087-3179.PNG;5088-3180.PNG
Q3,Match the following positions of the appendix:,"a)1-b, 2-a, 3-d, 4-c
b)1-c, 2-a, 3-b, 4-d
c)1-b, 2-d, 3-a, 4-c
d)1-c, 2-b, 3-a, 4-d","The correctly matched positions of the appendix are:
1 - b: Retrocaecal - most common position, seen in 74%
2 - d: paracaecal - seen in 2%
3 - a: subcaecal - seen in 1.5%
4 - c: Inside the pelvis - seen in 21%
The appendix is a short and broad blind muscular tube that becomes tubular with the differential growth of the caecum. This continued growth of the caecum rotates the appendix into a
retrocaecal but intraperitoneal position. In some cases, rotation of the appendix does not occur,  resulting in a pelvic, subcaecal, or paracaecal position. During development, if the caecum does   not migrate to its normal position in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, the appendix can be found near the gallbladder. In cases of intestinal malrotation, the appendix may be found in   the left iliac fossa.
various positions ofthe appendix are shown in the image below.",5074-3172.PNG,C,5089-3181.PNG
Q4,"A patient presents with dull aching pain in both legs. He gives a history of prolonged standing and tortuous veins in the legs. which of the following tests are done for saphenofemoral
incompetence?","a)1, 2, 3 and 4
b)1, 2 and 3
c)1, 2
d)3, 4","Brodie Trendelenburg test and Morrissey's test are performed to test the incompetence of the
saphenofemoral valve. Fegan’s method is used to detect perforator incompetence while Modified perthe’s test is a test for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
Brodie Trendelenburg test - Lay the patient down and elevate the leg. Empty the vessels and tie a tourniquet below the SFJ. Ask the patient to stand up:
• Trendelenburg’s test part l - Here the tourniquet is released. A rapid filling from above shows saphenofemoral incompetence.
• Trendelenburg’s test part ll - Here the tourniquet is not released. A gradual filling from below to upwards indicates perforator incompetence.
Morrissey’s cough impulse test - The limb is elevated to empty the varicose veins. Now it is put to  bed and the patient is asked to cough forcibly. An expansile cough impulse is felt at the saphenous opening if the saphenofemoral valve is incompetent. Similarly, a bruit may be heard on
auscultation. The patient is asked to cough. A cough impulse at the saphenofemoral junction indicates SFJ incompetence.
Fegan’s method - Mark the places of excessive bulges within the varicosities. Ask the patient to lie down and empty the varicose vessels. palpate along the marked area to look for gaps and pits in    the deep fascia, which indicates perforator incompetence.
Modified perthe’s test - A tourniquet is tied around the upper part of the thigh to prevent reflux    down the vein and the patient is asked to walk around. In the presence of normal communicating and deep veins, the varicose veins will shrink. If there is any block, the veins will get more
distended. An increase in pain and prominence of dilated veins indicate DVT.",,C,
Q5,which of the following statements is true about thymoma?,"a)Most common neoplasm of thymus
b)Most common posterior mediastinal tumor .
c)usually symptomatic with dyspnoea, dysphagia and Svc syndrome
d)chest xray is the investigation of choice","The true statement is that thymoma is the most common neoplasm of the thymus.
Thymoma is the most frequently encountered neoplasm of the anterior mediastinum (option B) in adults and is rare in children. It is seen most frequently in the age group of 4o and 6o years. Most patients with thymoma are asymptomatic (option C). Large thymic tumors may present with
symptoms related to a mass effect, which may include cough, chest pain, dyspnea, or SvC
syndrome. Around 1o% to 5o% of patients with thymoma may have symptoms suggestive of myasthenia gravis or have circulating antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor. other
paraneoplastic syndromes, including red cell aplasia, hypogammaglobulinemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, Cushing’s syndrome, or SIADH, may be present.
while the mediastinal mass can be identified on screening chest X-ray, imaging with
contrast-enhanced CT and MRI (option D) have a critical role in characterizing the mediastinal
masses. The diagnosis may be suspected based on history and CT imaging but imaging alone is
not diagnostic. The diagnosis is usually made after surgical resection due to the relative difficulty   of obtaining a needle biopsy. Biopsy should be avoided in cases where imaging is highly suggestive of thymoma. Masaoka staging system is used for thymomas and is based on the gross or
microscopic invasion of the capsule and of surrounding structures, as well as on the presence of metastases.
The definitive treatment for thymoma is complete surgical removal. Thymectomy leads to
improvement or resolution of symptoms of myasthenia gravis in only about 25% of patients with thymomas.",,A,
Q6,"In a patient who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, what is the ideal urine output?","a)5oo ml/day
b)o.5 ml/minute
c)o.5-1.5 ml/kg/hour
d)1 ml/kg","The ideal urine output in that patient following laparoscopic cholecystectomy is o.5-1.5
ml/kg/hour.
Normal urine output is expected in the postoperative period of a patient who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The average normal urine output in an adult is o.5-1.5
ml/kg/hour (option B) or approximately 15oo mL/day (option A).  A minimum urine output of 4oo mL/day is essential to excrete the end products of protein metabolism.
option D: Normal urine output in ml/kg would be o.5 - 1.5 ml/kg/hour multiplied by 24 which is 12-36 ml/kg per day.",,C,
Q7,"In a patient presenting with rectal prolapse, which of the following procedures is not done via the perineal approach?","a)Ripstein operation
b)Thiersch operation
c)Altemeier procedure
d)Delorme operation","Among the given options, the Ripstein operation is the abdominal approach for rectal prolapse. It is managed by using the following approaches:
• The perineal approach is easy to perform with fewer complications but a high recurrence rate. The surgeries done using this approach for rectal prolapse are the following:
• Thiersch's wiring
• Delorme's mucosectomy



• Altemeier's procedure or perineal rectosigmoidectomy
• The abdominal approach is difficult to perform with more complications but a lower recurrence rate. The surgeries done using this approach are the following:
• Moschcowitz repair
• Ripstein and wells rectopexy; ventral rectopexy or suture rectopexy
• Resection rectopexy
If the patient is fit enough for an abdominal procedure, it is preferred over the perineal procedure, since the risk of recurrence is lower. The perineal approach is preferred in elderly patients with
comorbidities and in young men since the abdominal approach may injure the pelvic autonomic nerves which may result in sexual dysfunction.",,A,
Q8,"In a patient with an inguinal hernia, the surgeon reduces the entire hernial sac into the abdominal cavity without reducing the contents. what is this known as?","a)Maydl's hernia
b)Reduction en masse
c)Sliding hernia
d)Incarcerated hernia","The surgeon reducing the entire hernial sac into the abdominal cavity without reducing the
contents is referred to as reduction en masse of the hernia.
Reduction en-masse of inguinal hernia refers to the reduction or migration of the hernial sac
along with the incarcerated bowel into the properitoneal space. The properitoneal space lies
between the parietal peritoneum and the anterior abdominal wall. This is likely to occur following forcible attempts to reduce the hernia but may occur spontaneously. Though the hernial sac no
longer lies in the inguinal or femoral canal, it contains an obstructed bowel loop that causes small bowel obstruction. This is a rare condition as forcible reduction of hernias is not done and early     repair is carried out.
The patient may give a history of difficult reduction and the symptoms of bowel obstruction
persist even after the hernia is reduced. on a CT scan, a hernial sac in properitoneal space with a fibrous constriction at the neck may be visualized. This hernial sac will contain the bowel loop
with wall enhancement and fluid that suggest strangulation. Early surgical intervention is required.
other options:
option A: Maydl's hernias are defined as the presence of two small bowel loops within a single hernial sac, that is, there are two efferent and two afferent loops of the bowel, forming a ""w""    shape.





option B: sliding hernia occurs when an internal organ composes a portion of the wall of the
hernia sac. The most common viscus involved is the sigmoid colon and its mesentery on the left side and the caecum on the right side. It is more common on the left side. They are usually
variants of indirect inguinal hernias. The failure to recognize the visceral component of the hernia sac resulting in injury to the bowel or bladder is the major concern in sliding hernia.
option D: Hernias which cannot be reduced are referred to as incarcerated hernias while hernias with compromised blood supply to its contents are known as strangulated hernias.",,B,5092-3182.PNG
Q9,which of the following statements about claudication pain is not true?,"a)Rest pain is seen more in the night
b)pain in intermittent claudication comes at first step of walking.
c)Most common cause is atheroma
d)The clinical stem does not reflect the site of peripheral arterial obstruction","pain in intermittent claudication is brought on by walking and doesnot start with the first step of walking.
peripheral artery occlusion or stenosis is predominantly caused by atherosclerosis or atheroma
(option c) and thromboembolic disease. The resulting stenosis or occlusion produces signs and      symptoms related to the organ that is supplied by the affected artery. such occlusion in the lower   limbs presents with claudication pain, rest pain, and gangrene. Though the muscle groups affected by claudication are present at one anatomical level below the level of arterial disease, the clinical    stem does not reflect the exact site of the peripheral arterial obstruction. (option D)
Intermittent claudication pain is a feature of arterial stenosis or occlusion that occurs due to the anaerobic metabolism occurring in the muscle. claudication pain may be of different types and   can be differentiated as follows:
• vascular (intermittent) claudication pain is brought on by walking and is relieved by rest within 5 minutes. (option B)
• claudication pain present on taking the first step of walking is classical for osteoarthritis.
• Neurogenic claudication occurs with changes in the position of the back such as bending forward and straightening. It takes more time to be relieved by rest (more than 5 minutes). It may be seen  in cases of nerve compression from lumbar intervertebral disc prolapse or spinal stenosis.



Rest pain occurs when the occlusive disease progresses in severity and anaerobic respiration
occurs even at rest. Though this pain is present during the day, it is exacerbated on lying down at night (option A) due to loss of gravity dependant perfusion of the foot. This may be relieved by     hanging the foot out of the bed to restore the gravitational effects.",,B,
Q10,A 73-year-old patient presents with painless rectal bleeding. which of the below-mentioned investigations are done for this patient?,"a)3 and 4
b)2, 3 and 4
c)1 and 2
d)1, 2 and 3","colonoscopy, cEcT and cEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) can be done in an old patient
presenting with painless rectal bleeding. serum cA 19-9 is a pancreatic cancer biomarker and has no role in this case.
Rectal bleeding occurs due to pathology of the lower gastrointestinal tract below the ligament of Treitz. The differentials that can be considered in a case of rectal bleeding are:
• colon cancer
• Inflammatory bowel disease
• Diverticular diseases
• Hemorrhoids
• Angiodysplasia
colonoscopy with biopsy has a key role in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease,
distinguishing between ulcerative colitis and crohn’s colitis and monitoring the response to
treatment. colonoscopy is also the investigation of choice if colorectal cancer is suspected,
especially in old patients. Angiodysplasia is suspected in patients above the age of 5o and can be identified by a colonoscopy.
computed tomography (cT) colonography is sensitive in picking up polyps and has the advantage of being less invasive than colonoscopy. spiral cT can aid in the diagnosis of complicated
diverticular disease.
carcinoembryonic antigen (cEA) is a non-specific serum biomarker that is elevated in colorectal cancer and hence may be done in this case.",,D,
Q11,smoking increases the risk of which of the following diseases?,"a)2 &amp; 3
b)1 &amp; 4
c)2, 3, 4
d)1, 3, 4","smoking increases the risk of which of duct ectasia, Mondor's disease, and breast carcinoma.
Duct ectasia is defined as dilated major milk ducts. It is considered a disorder of involution as
part ofANDI. Abnormally dilated ducts are filled with debris. This acts as an irritant and can lead to periductal inflammation and subsequent fibrosis, leading to nipple retraction. Duct ectasia
appears to be associated with smoking and diabetes.
The thrombophlebitis of the superficial veins of the breast and anterior chest wall is called
Mondor’s disease. The pathognomonic feature is a tender thrombosed subcutaneous cord, usually attached to the skin. when the skin over the breast is stretched by raising the arm, a narrow,
shallow, subcutaneous groove alongside the cord becomes apparent. smoking was found to be a
potential factor involved in the pathogenesis of Mondor’s disease. other risk factors include breast



surgery, breast biopsy, an inflammatory process, breast cancer, and trauma.
The risk factors of breast cancer can be divided into modifiable (those that can be modified by   adopting a healthy diet and lifestyle) and non-modifiable risk factors. The events increasing the oestrogenic exposure of the breast are said to be risk factors for breast cancer, such as early
menarche, late menopause, nulliparity, late first pregnancy, and hormone replacement with high estrogen therapy. smoking is a modifiable risk factor with a relative risk (RR) = 1.14 for smoking 25 or more cigarettes/day and RR = 1.o7 for smoking for 2o years or more.
Fibroadenoma is the most common cause of a breast lump in women aged 15–25 years. It arises from the hyperplasia of a lobule and is surrounded by a well-defined capsule. smoking is not a    risk factor for fibroadenomas.",,D,
Q12,Identify the following image:,"a)Hemangioma
b)cystic hygroma
c)Branchial cyst
d)Ranula","The given scenario and the image of a cystic swelling on the floor of the mouth are suggestive of a ranula.
Ranula is a mucus extravasation cyst arising from the sublingual gland. It produces a
characteristic translucent swelling that gives the appearance of a frog’s belly. A ranula usually resolves spontaneously.
A plunging ranula is a mucus retention cyst. It has mucus collecting below the gland and perforating through the mylohyoid muscle.
Treatment should include removal of the sublingual gland as this gland has multiple ducts and ranulas can recur if the gland is left behind. Incision, drainage and marsupialisation have low   success rates.
other options:
options A: Hemangioma is the most common vascular tumor and is characterized by increased abnormal proliferation of endothelium. Hemangiomas develop in infancy and are usually not     visible at birth. They appear red or maroon if superficial, and bluish if deep.




option B: Cystic hygroma is usually seen in neonates and early childhood. They are cystic
swellings filled with lymph fluid and are characteristically brilliantly translucent. They occur in the neck and can involve the parotid, submandibular, tongue, etc. The swelling is soft and
partially compressible. Definitive treatment is the excision of the swelling.


option C: The branchial cyst develops from the vestigial remnants of the second branchial
cleft. swelling in the neck beneath the anterior border of the upper third of the sternomastoid  muscle. It is smooth, soft, fluctuant, and often transilluminate. The below image shows a large right-sided branchial cyst.",5077-3174.PNG,D,5094-3183.PNG;5095-3185.PNG;5095-3184.PNG
Q13,Feeding is done through the given method. which of the following is not a complication of this?,"a)Refeeding syndrome
b)osteoporosis
c)pneumothorax
d)Aspiration pneumonia","The given image shows a central line. pneumothorax, osteoporosis, and refeeding syndrome are likely complications in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition through a central line.



Aspiration pneumonia is more common in enteral feeding and can be prevented by placing the patient in a semi-recumbent position while feeding.
complications of enteral nutrition are as follows:
• Tube-related (most common): Malposition, displacement, blockage, breakage/leakage, local complications (e.g. erosion of skin/mucosa)
• Gastrointestinal: Diarrhoea, bloating, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, aspiration, constipation
• Metabolic/biochemical: Electrolyte disorders, vitamin, mineral, and trace element deficiencies, drug interactions
• Infective: Exogenous (handling contamination) and endogenous (patient)
other options:
option A: Refeeding syndrome is a significant metabolic complication of both parenteral and  enteral feeding. It occurs days after feeding is commenced in patients who have been severely malnourished. The major pathological process is hypophosphatemia which causes fluid and     electrolyte shifts between the intra- and extracellular compartments.
option B: osteoporosis and osteomalacia are complications of long-term parenteral nutrition and may lead to fractures or kidney stones. calcium, phosphate, vitamin D supplementation, and
bisphosphonates can help prevent as well as treat this complication.
option c: pneumothorax is the most common complication of line insertion and most commonly occurs during the insertion of subclavian lines. It is managed by insertion of a chest drain.",5077-3173.PNG,D,
Q14,Identify the surgical instrument shown in the image.,"a)Adson's forceps
b)kocher's forceps
c)Mixter forceps
d)Rampley forceps","The given surgical instrument is a Mixter's right angle forceps that can be used to pass ligatures and dissect pedicles.
other options:
option A: Adson's forceps or cerci-Adson-Brown forceps have a double grasping tip that ensures grasping with better stabilization. It is the most appropriate forceps for grasping cartilage in
rhinoplasty. Its multi-teeth tip prevents cartilage damage or bounce.





option B: kocher forceps have an opposing tooth in the tip and serrations in the distal blades. It is used to hold pedicles, tough structures, and cut ends of muscles. It is also used for holding ribs
during rib dissection and for holding the resected bowel.


option D: Rampley's sponge-holding forceps have a fenestrated, serrated, and flat end. The uses are:
• to clean the operative field and swab the cavities
• to mop the oozing area
• to hold the gallbladder and cervix during surgeries
• for blunt dissections",5078-3175.PNG,C,5097-3187.PNG;5097-3186.PNG;5098-3188.PNG
Q15,"A 25-year-old male patient was brought to the casualty after a road traffic accident with a    suspected pelvic fracture. on examination, he is found to be in hypovolemic shock. what is the earliest treatment for the control of hemorrhage in this case?","a)Immediate internal fixation
b)Multiple blood transfusions
c)use bedsheets to compress the pelvis
d)Emergency external fixation","The earliest treatment to control hemorrhage in a case of suspected pelvic fracture is to use bedsheets to compress the pelvis similar to a compression binder.
The most likely source of bleeding in hemodynamically unstable patients following blunt trauma is abdominal or pelvic bleeding. A pelvic binder or a sheet should be applied around the true
pelvis of all hemodynamically unstable patients and not removed until after a pelvic fracture has been excluded. It must be correctly positioned at the level of the greater trochanters. This is a
potentially life-saving procedure that has to be done in the emergency department. Following this, they require an immediate pelvic radiograph. Mechanical testing of the pelvis should never be
performed. A pelvic fracture should always be diagnosed radiographically.
In fractures of the pelvic ring, there is a risk of injury to the major vessels (internal iliac and
external iliac vessels) and to the venous plexus around the sacroiliac joint. Bleeding from the
venous plexus is the major cause of pelvic hemorrhage. pelvic fractures can have a high mortality rate of more than 4o% in some open pelvic fractures. Early mortality is mostly the result of
hemorrhage.
Bleeding of venous origin can be controlled by compression either by binding/ external fixator or    by extraperitoneal pelvic packing to compress the pelvic veins. persistent bleeding after packing or bleeding of arterial origin may require angioembolisation. Severe pelvic injuries require a
multidisciplinary team approach. An exploratory laparotomy may be considered if
• the source of the bleeding is in doubt
• FAST/CT results are positive, showing a significant amount of blood in the peritoneal cavity
• concurrent intra-abdominal injury cannot be excluded",,C,
Q16,which of the following are done in Breast conservation surgery?,"a)1, 2, 3
b)1, 3, 4
c)1 , 2
d)2, 3","wide local excision, axillary node dissection, and frozen section (biopsy) during surgery are done as a part of Breast Conservation surgery (BCs). All patients with BCs must receive radiotherapy   (statement 4) and are together known as Breast Conservation Therapy (BCT).
Breast conservation surgery involves removing the tumor with a 1mm margin of normal breast
tissue. Removal of primary breast cancer is also called lumpectomy/ tylectomy/ partial
mastectomy/ wide local excision (statement 1). Histological examination via intraoperative frozen section (statement 3) is done to examine for positive margins. patients with positive margins
should have a revision of margins known as ‘cavity shave’. Assessment of regional lymph nodes is done via a separate incision in the axilla (statement 2).
Absolute contraindications of BCT:
• 1st trimester of pregnancy (may be done for some 2nd and many 3rd trimester patients who can receive radiation after delivery)
• persistently positive margin (2 microscopy shows positive margins)
• Multicentric lumps
• Diffuse microcalcification
•
Extensive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIs)

Q18,A 63-year-old female presented to the OPD with abdominal pain and a tense and tender  swelling below and lateral to the pubic tubercle. what is the most likely diagnosis of this condition?,"a)strangulated femoral hernia
b)strangulated inguinal hernia
c)Intussusception
d)Adhesions","The above clinical scenario of a tense and tender swelling present lateral and below the pubic
tubercle is suggestive of a femoral hernia. The femoral hernia traverses the femoral canal, which lies medial to the femoral vein.
A femoral hernia occurs in both males and females, but it is more common in females. It will pass through the femoral ring proximally to enter the femoral canal. The femoral canal is bound by the femoral vein laterally, the inguinal ligament anteriorly, and the pelvic bone with iliopectineal
ligament (Cooper's) and lacunar ligament (Gimbernat's) medially. Lacunar ligament has a sharp unyielding edge that prevents the reduction of the femoral hernia. The incidence of
strangulation in femoral hernias is high because of the narrowness of the neck of the sac and the rigidity of the femoral ring.
All patients with unexplained bowel obstruction should be examined properly for a femoral
hernia. surgery is the only treatment for femoral hernia, and these patients should be treated on priority because of the high risk of strangulation. The surgical approaches which are used are:
• Low approach (Lockwood): suitable when there is no risk of strangulation; bowel can't be inspected and resected in this approach
• Inguinal approach (Lotheissen)
• High approach (McEvedy): suitable for emergency situations when the risk of bowel strangulation is high
• Laparoscopic approach: both TEP and TAPP approaches can be used; the laparoscopic approach is recommended in women.
other options:
option B: Inguinal hernia is above and medial to the pubic tubercle. Another structure that is useful in differentiating between inguinal and femoral hernia is inguinal ligament.
An inguinal hernia leaves the abdominal cavity just above the inguinal ligament and a femoral hernia leaves just below the inguinal ligament.
option C: In case of Intussusception, patients present with cramping abdominal pain,
palpable sausage-shaped abdominal mass, vomiting, and passage of red currant jelly stools.



option D: Adhesions can lead to intestinal obstruction, but there won't be any swelling below and lateral to the pubic tubercle,.",,A,
Q19,A patient presented with a Type 1 choledochal cyst. All of the following statements are correct except?,"a)Increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma
b)cyst opened and drainage is done
c)Todani classification is used
d)Due to anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction","In the given clinical scenario, a patient presented with a Type 1 choledochal cyst. cyst opening
and drainage will not be done in this patient. the preferred course of action involves the complete surgical excision of the cyst. complete resection of the cyst is essential because there is a risk of    malignant transformation (cholangiocarcinoma). (option A)
choledochal cysts are congenital cystic dilations of the intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic biliary
tree. They present with a triad of jaundice, a palpable upper quadrant mass, and abdominal pain. The clinical triad (abdominal pain, mass, and jaundice) and the MRcP (Magnetic Resonance
cholangiopancreatography) findings suggest choledochal cyst. According to the Todani
classification, the type III choledochal cyst opens into the duodenum. The treatment of choice for type III choledochal cyst is Endoscopic sphincterotomy followed by surveillance.
choledochal cysts are congenital dilations of the intra and/or extrahepatic biliary system.
Pathogenesis involves an Anomalous Pancreaticobiliary Junction (APBJ) which may allow reflux into the biliary tract, leading to inflammation, increased biliary pressure, and cyst formation.
(option D)
clinical features of choledochal cysts are as follows
• 6o% of cases are diagnosed before the age of 1o years
• more common in females than in males (4:1)
• The classic symptom triad includes abdominal pain, right upper quadrant mass, and jaundice (most consistent symptom)
• other symptoms- nausea, weight loss, fever, pruritus, etc
complications include
• cholangitis (may lead to cirrhosis and portal hypertension)
• Pancreatitis
• Bile peritonitis (due to cyst rupture)
• cholangiocarcinoma
Diagnostic investigations for choledochal cysts are as follows:
• ultrasonography:
• confirms the presence of an abnormal cyst
• Define the dimensions of the cyst
• Define its relationship to the vascular structures in the porta hepatis, as well as the intrahepatic ductal configuration
• Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI/MRcP) is the investigation of choice. It reveals the anatomy of the ducts



• CT - delineates the extent of the intra- or extrahepatic dilatation
• ERCP - defines the distal biliary tree
Todani classification (option C) of the choledochal cysts along with their management is as shown below,
Biliary-enteric reconstruction is not required in Type III choledochal cyst as it has the lowest risk of malignancy, and it may not be associated with ABPJ (anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction).  Therefore, endoscopic drainage is sufficient.

Type of choledochal cyst	surgical management	
Type I -  fusiform dilatation o f the bile duct (most common - seen in 75% of patients)	complete surgical excision, c  holecystectomy, and Roux-en
-y hepaticojejunostomy	
Type II - saccular diverticulu  m from the common bile duc t	Diverticulectomy, cholecystec tomy, and common bile duct  repair	
Type III- diverticulum within  the pancreas, also known asc holedochoceles	ERCP + sphincterotomy (onl y cyst in which reconstructio  n is not required)	
Type IV	a - multiple cysts (both intrah epatic and extrahepatic)	Liver transplan t
b - multiple cysts limited to t he extrahepatic biliary tree	kasai procedure (Portoentero stomy)	
Type V - multiple cysts involv ing only intrahepatic ducts (C aroli's disease)	Liver transplant",,B,
Q20,A patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis. specimen revealed that she had gall bladder carcinoma infiltrating the muscularis layer. what is the management?,"a)Radical cholecystectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy
b)Adjuvant chemotherapy
c)Extended cholecystectomy
d)surveillance","In the given clinical scenario, gallbladder carcinoma with T1b lesions is detected incidentally after cholecystectomy. Treatment guidelines for the same are as follows:
• Up to stage Ia and stage Ib with negative margins, a standard cholecystectomy would suffice.
• stage Ib with perineural, lymphovascular invasion, positive cystic duct margins, or poor
differentiation, and stage II, extended cholecystectomy should be performed. Extended
cholecystectomy involves the removal of the gall bladder, segments IVB and V of the liver, and lymph nodes along the hepatoduodenal ligament, with or without removal of the common bile duct (CBD).
However, the likelihood of nodal disease increases significantly with T1b lesions and perineural, lymphatic, or vascular invasion, therefore, extended cholecystectomy is generally recommended for all patients who are medically fit with T1b or greater level of invasion.
If the initial procedure was performed laparoscopically, the surgeon should examine the
laparoscopic port sites. The finding of disease at the port sites is a sign of generalized peritoneal disease and carries a very poor prognosis. However, resection of port sites is no longer



recommended.
chemotherapy is not required in early gallbladder cancer. Radiation has no role. Treatment of gallbladder carcinoma:

TNM sta ging	Treatment
T1a	simple cholecystectomy
T1b, T2, T3	Radical cholecystectomy
T4	unresectable, chemotherapy   and palliative nonsurgical the rapy are provided
N1	Regional lymphadenectomy
N2	Radical cholecystectomy plus hepatopancreatic duodenect  omy",,C,
Q21,"A man presented with a history of stab injury over the arm. on examination, there was a  hematoma present, and radial and ulnar pulses were not felt. A 3.5cm longitudinal tear is noted in the brachial artery. which among the following is the best treatment option?","a)primary repair with end to end anastomosis
b)Repair with great saphenous vein graft
c)Repair with prosthetic graft
d)Repair with saphenous vein patch","In this patient, who has sustained a long tear to the brachial artery due to a stab injury, the best    treatment option is to repair it with a great saphenous vein interposition graft harvested from the patient's uninjured leg.
The most desirable graft used is the great saphenous vein . A native vein graft is preferable to a prosthetic graft because:
• Its elastic properties are comparable to that of an artery and enable pulsatile flow
• The diameter is similar to that of an extremity artery
• It is not thrombogenic and has long term patency
other grafts that can be used are cephalic vein, lesser saphenous vein, and prosthetic
conduits. cephalic vein is not the first choice because it is less muscular than greater saphenous vein, and might also compromise the upper limb venous access in the already injured patient.
Both the cephalic and the lesser saphenous veins present problems while harvesting in a trauma patient.
other options:
option A: primary arterial repair with end-to-end anastomosis can be done only if the repair is
tension-free. If the length of the injured area is long, vessel injuries cannot be repaired by primary end-to-end anastomoses and instead require an interposition graft.
option c: prosthetic grafts are only preferred when there has been a trauma to the native saphenous vein or when there is a size mis-match. polytetrafluoroethylene (pTFE) graft is commonly used.



option D: saphenous vein patch is used in the closure of the arteriotomy site during carotid endarterectomies.",,B,
Q22,which of the following drugs are not used in the management of a thyrotoxic crisis?,"a)Acetaminophen
b)Aspirin
c)Lugol's iodine
d)propranolol","Aspirin has no role in the management of a thyrotoxic crisis. All of the other options listed are used in managing the symptoms. Aspirin and other NsAIDs are to be avoided as they can
interfere with protein binding and further exacerbate the condition.
Thyroid storm/ Thyrotoxic crisis:
It is a rare but severe life-threatening complication of hyperthyroidism induced by the release of excessive thyroid hormones.
causes:
• Abrupt cessation of antithyroid medications
• Infection
• when a thyrotoxic patient has been inadequately prepared for thyroidectomy.
• Thyroid or non-thyroid surgery
• Trauma in patients with untreated thyrotoxicosis
• Amiodarone administration
• Exposure to iodinated contrast agents
• Following RAI (radioactive iodine) therapy
Features:
• They present 12–24 hours after surgery with hyperpyrexia and severe dehydration
• cardiovascular: circulatory collapse, hypotension, palpitations, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure
• GI symptoms: vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice.
• Neurological symptoms: restlessness, irritability, delirium, tremor, convulsions, and coma Treatment:
• supportive measures – rehydration by proper fluid therapy, tepid sponging, cooling blankets
• Acetaminophen for fever.
• Thionamides like Propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole or carbimazole are used. They inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis. Propylthiouracil also inhibits the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.  Hence, PTU is the preferred drug in thyroid storm. However, the risk for severe liver injury and  acute liver failure associated with PTU therapy makes either carbimazole or
methimazole first-choice in patients with deranged liver function tests.
• Lugol’s iodide is given one hour after intake of thionamides. They inhibit thyroid hormone
synthesis by wolff- chaikoff effect. Large doses of iodide inhibit organic binding of the iodide and hence decrease thyroid hormone synthesis.



• propranolol is used to reduce tachycardia and other adrenergic manifestations. It also reduces the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.
• Glucocorticoids – reduce the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 and controls the shock.
• Digitoxin, cardiac monitoring is crucial.",,B,
Q23,Identify the incision.,"a)Battle incision
b)Gibson incision
c)Robson incision
d)Lanz incision","The image above shows a Gibson incision. Gibson incision is used for kidney transplantation or as an extraperitoneal approach to the distal ureter with low morbidity.
The traditional pelvic Gibson incision is an oblique or curvilinear incision that starts 3 cm above and parallel to the inguinal ligament and extends vertically 3 centimeters medial to the anterior
superior iliac spine (ASIS) extending down toward the inguinal fold and terminating just lateral to the rectus muscle or continuing to above the symphysis pubis.
The Gibson incision is the traditional approach for renal transplant and transplant nephrectomy. This muscle-splitting incision provides great extraperitoneal access to pelvic vessels, the lower
ureter, and the bladder for benign and malignant disease and is also utilized as a part of minimally invasive nephrectomy for specimen extraction or use of a hand port.
other options:
option A: battle incision a lower right paramedian incision but placed more laterally than the
standard paramedian incision. It is suitable for dealing with acute appendicitis and pathologies in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.
option C: Mayo Robson’s incision is a right upper paramedian incision extended like a hockey stick to the midline. It is indicated in cholecystectomy.
option D: Lanz incision, a transverse or skin crease incision for appendicitis, 2 cm below the
umbilicus, centered on the midclavicular–mid-inguinal line. Due to its continuation with Langer’s lines, the Lanz incision produces much more aesthetically pleasing results with reduced scarring.

Q24,which of the following is the best method to conclusively localize a parathyroid adenoma?,"a)SPECT sestamibi
b)Tc99 sestamibi scan
c)USG neck
d)MRI","The best method to conclusively localise a parathyroid adenoma is SPECT sestamibi.
Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is commonly used because of its
improved spatial resolution. Sestamibi combined with CT can be used to detect smaller
parathyroid tissues. It can also detect ectopic glands in the mediastinum or in the deeper cervical region.


Ultrasonography:
• It is inexpensive and noninvasive.
• Mediastinal parathyroid tissue cannot be detected because USG cannot penetrate the sternum or clavicle.
Nuclear medicine scanning with radiolabeled Sestamibi (Tc99 sestamibi scan) is also a widely
used technique. Sestamibi accumulates in parathyroid adenomas. This radionuclide is
concentrated in the thyroid and parathyroid tissue but usually washes out of normal thyroid tissue in under an hour. It persists in abnormal parathyroid tissue. Tc99 sestamibi scan is a 2D study, so SPECT sestamibi, which is a 3D study is preferred over Tc99 sestamibi.  scan. SPECT sestamibi
has high specificity and sensitivity as compared to Tc99 sestamibi.
MRI is rarely used because of its low sensitivity. occasionally, MRI may be indicated in pregnant patients in whom ultrasound is noninformative because MRI avoids radiation exposure.",,A,5105-3189-1.png
Q25,which classification of bile duct injury takes into account both vascular as well as the location of the injury?,"a)Strassberg
b)Hannover
c)Bismuth
d)McMahon","Hannover classification of bile duct injury takes into account both vascular as well as the location of the injury.



Hannover, bile duct injuries were divided into five types from A to E. Vascular injuries are included in Type C and Type D.
• Type A is peripheral bile leakage.
• Type B is stricture of CHD or CBD without injury.
• Type C is lateral CHD or CBD injury.
• Type D is the total transection of CHD.
• Type E is bile duct stricture of the main bile duct without bile leakage at the postoperative state.
other options:
option A: The strasberg classification of bile duct injury is a widely used system to anatomically define bile duct injuries.
option C: The Bismuth–Corlette classification system provides an anatomic description of the tumor location and longitudinal extension in the biliary tree.
option D: The McMahon classification separated the injuries by the width of bile duct injury",,B,
Q26,"If open cardiac massage were to be performed on a patient, what category would it come under?","a)clean
b)contaminated
c)clean-contaminated
d)Dirty","open cardiac massage is classified as a contaminated wound.
Contaminated wounds are class III surgical wounds. They include fresh open accidental wounds, surgeries with a major break in sterile technique, gross spillage of the gastrointestinal tract, or
incision through an inflamed nonpurulent tissue. Examples include:
• open cardiac massage
• penetrating abdominal trauma
surgical wounds are classified based on the expected amount of bacterial load at the time of surgery.
open cardiac massage is performed when there is inadequate cardiac output, after emergency thoracotomy for penetrating chest trauma, during pericardial tamponade.
Class I surgical wounds are clean wounds (option A). They are noninfected surgical wounds without any inflammation. Examples include:
• Hernia repair
• Breast biopsy specimen
Class II surgical wounds are clean/contaminated wounds (option C). They are surgical wounds that include an entry hollow viscus such as the respiratory tract or gastrointestinal tract under controlled conditions without significant spillage. Examples include:
• Cholecystectomy
• Elective gastrointestinal surgery
Class IV surgical wounds are dirty wounds (option D). They are old traumatic wounds with the  presence of necrotic tissue and perforated viscus with a heavy load of contamination. Examples



include:
• perforated diverticulitis
• Necrotizing soft tissue infection",,B,
Q27,"A patient who was a known case of rheumatoid arthritis is brought to the ER due to dizziness. Her Bp was 9o/6ommHg. she was prescribed a medication by her local doctor which she
stopped taking suddenly. Her blood sugar was low and serum potassium was 6mEq/L. which of the following drugs should be given to her next?","a)IV saline
b)Hydrocortisone
c)Dopamine infusion
d)sodium bicarbonate","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of an Addisonian crisis. It is a life-threatening condition  caused due to sudden insufficiency of adrenal hormones. If a patient displays features of adrenal insufficiency, treatment must immediately be commenced, before awaiting the biochemical
diagnosis. Intravenous administration of hydrocortisone 1oo mg every 6 hours, &gt;2 litres of saline is given in 6 hours under careful cardiovascular monitoring.
The symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are as follows:
• Glucocorticoid deficiency leads to:
• Fatigue, lack of energy
• weight loss, anorexia
• Myalgia
• Hypoglycemia
• Low blood pressure, postural hypotension
• Mineralocorticoid deficiency leads to:
• Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting
• Dizziness, postural hypotension
• Low blood pressure, postural hypotension
• Hyponatremia
• Hyperkalemia
• Adrenal androgen deficiency leads to dry and itchy skin, loss of libido
• The hyperpigmentation of sun-exposed areas results from excess ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) secretion which occurs in response to decreased adrenal cortical hormones.
primary causes of the Addisonian crisis include:
• Adrenal haemorrhage
• Acute infection
secondary causes of the Addisonian crisis include:
• surgery
• Cessation of steroid therapy
• postpartum pituitary necrosis.",,B,
Q28,what is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients?,"a)Hypervitaminosis D
b)Malignancy
c)parathyroid adenoma
d)parathyroid hyperplasia","cancer is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients, whereas
hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia detected incidentally in outpatients. The causes of hypercalcemia in cancer :
• cancers affecting bone like multiple myeloma, leukemia, bony metastasis - cause the bone to break down which releases excess calcium into the blood
• pseudohyperparathyroidism - tumours producing parathyroid hormone-related peptide (pTHrp) cause the bone to release calcium into the blood. The most common carcinoma  associated is squamous cell carcinoma of lung.
• cancers affecting kidneys - failure to remove excess calcium from the blood
• Dehydration caused by nausea and vomiting - difficult for the kidneys to remove calcium from the blood properly
• Lack of physical activity - causes bone breakdown, releasing calcium into the blood",,B,
Q29,An elderly lady was diagnosed to have a gallbladder polyp. she was told that she has a risk for gallbladder cancer. which of the following is not a risk factor for gallbladder cancer?,"a)porcelain GB
b)primary sclerosing cholangitis
c)A single gall bladder polyp &lt; 1 cm
d)Gall stone &gt; 3cm","A single gallbladder polyp &lt;1 cm is not a risk factor for carcinoma gallbladder. Gallbladder polyps &gt;1omm have malignant potential.
Risk factors for carcinoma gallbladder:
• Gallstones of size &gt;3 cm (most important risk factor)
• porcelain gallbladder
• Anomalous pancreato-biliary junction
• choledochal cyst
• Adenomatous polyps
• primary sclerosing cholangitis
• obesity
• salmonella typhii infection.
Gallbladder carcinoma is a rare malignancy that is seen in the elderly. It is associated with a poor prognosis and is indistinguishable from cholecystitis or cholelithiasis. It is usually diagnosed
when patients undergo cholecystectomy for gallstones.
Its clinical features include right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Jaundice is a late feature. cA 19-9 is elevated in the carcinoma gallbladder and is used for monitoring.
The preoperative diagnosis is often made on ultrasonography and followed up by a cT scan or MRI/Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography.
A percutaneous biopsy under radiological guidance is done for pathological examination. pET scanning helps in detecting metastatic disease.



In select cases, a laparoscopic examination is useful in staging the disease. Laparoscopy can also detect peritoneal or liver metastases. The most important prognostic factor is the depth of
invasion (T-stage).",,C,
Q30,which of the following is the most important prognostic factor of breast carcinoma?,"a)Axillary lymph node status
b)size
c)Distant metastasis
d)Hormonal status","Axillary lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor in patients with breast
cancer (non-metastatic). women with node-negative disease have less than a 3o% risk of
recurrence, compared with as much as a 75% risk for women with node-positive disease. The presence of lymph node involvement at initial diagnosis also serves as a prognostic factor
in recurrent breast cancer.
Prognostic factors in metastatic breast cancer include:
• Relapse-free intervals
• site of metastasis
• Estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) status
Hormone receptor status (estrogen receptor [ER]/progesterone receptor [PR]) is the most
important prognostic factor in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Long relapse-free
intervals, absence of brain or visceral metastases, and ER/PR positivity are associated with better prognosis in metastatic breast cancer.",,A,
