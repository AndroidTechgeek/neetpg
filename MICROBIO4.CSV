b)Cryptosporidium parvum is the most common organism implicated worldwide
c)oocysts are immediately infective after being excreted in stool
d)It is an obligate intracellular organism","oocysts are immediately infective after being excreted in the stool.

cryptosporidium is a coccidian parasite and implicated in causing traveler's diarrhea in
immunocompromised patients. The two cryptosporidium species responsible are c.hominis and c.parvum. As the patient has undergone a renal transplant, he/she would most likely be on
immunosuppressive medications, making the infection likely. cryptosporidium hominis is the most common organism implicated worldwide
The infective form is oocysts, excreted in the affected patient's feces, acquired through drinking or recreational water. The oocysts are immediately infectious (unlike Isospora oocysts, which require maturation), and may cause autoinfection or implicated in person to person transmission.
Because of its small size (4-5micron), it is difficult to see in routine staining, hence is subjected to acid-fast/kinyoun's stain.
once ingested, the 4 sporozoites come out of the cyst and attach to the small intestinal mucosa. It causes crampy abdominal pain and non-inflammatory watery diarrhea.
Treatment is mainly supportive, though nitazoxanide has been FDA approved for use in cryptosporidium.

b)Pseudomonas
c)Haemophilus influenzae
d)Actinomyces","pneumonia due to a gram-negative pleomorphic bacillus growing on chocolate agar which is catalase and oxidase-positive is most likely Haemophilus influenza.
Haemophilus pneumonia typically occurs in infants and is accompanied by empyema and sometimes meningitis as well. In older children and adults, the picture is of lobar
pneumonia. sputum is collected for the detection and isolation of Hemophilus. As the bacillus is very sensitive to low temperatures, specimens should never be refrigerated before inoculation.    H.infiuenzae is a Gram-negative, non-motile, non-sporing bacillus, exhibiting considerable
pleomorphism. In sputum, it usually occurs as clusters of coccobacillary forms.
The bacillus has fastidious growth requirements. The accessory growth factors, named X and v, present in the blood are essential for growth. catalase and
oxidase reactions are positive. Nitrates are reduced to nitrites. Biotyping has been done on the basis of indole production.

cultures may be preserved for about a month on chocolate agar slopes. chocolate agar is made by heating blood agar to 8o-9o°c for 15-2o minutes. This causes the release of V factor from within    the erythrocytes.

Q24,The disruption of which of the following is responsible for watery diarrhea in cholera caused by Vibrio?,"a)Intercalated discs
b)Macula densa
c)zonula occludens
d)Hemidesmosomes","The disruption of zonula occludens is responsible for watery diarrhea in cholera caused by vibrio cholerae.
zonula occludens toxin (zot) is an enterotoxin elaborated by vibrio cholerae that increases
intestinal permeability by interacting with a mammalian cell receptor with subsequent activation of intracellular signaling leading to the disassembly of the intercellular tight junctions.
Mechanism of action of cholera toxin:
• The cholera toxin molecule consists of 1 A and 5 B subunits. The B (binding) units attach to the GM1 ganglioside receptors on the surface of jejunal epithelial cells. The A (active) subunit,
on being transported into the enterocyte, dissociates into A1 and A2. A2 fragment only links

biologically active A1 to the B subunit.
• A1 causes prolonged activation of cellular adenylate cyclase and accumulation of cAMP, leading to outpouring into the small intestinal lumen, of large quantities of water and electrolytes. This    leads to watery diarrhea which is isotonic with plasma but contains much more potassium and     bicarbonate.
• The toxin also inhibits the intestinal absorption of sodium and chloride.
• All clinical manifestations and complications in cholera result from the massive water and electrolyte depletion thus caused.",,C,
Q25,Affinity maturation is due to:,"a)Isotype switching
b)somatic hypermutation
c)mRNA splicing
d)VDJ rearrangement","Affinity maturation is due to somatic hypermutation.
Affinity maturation is the process by which antibodies gain increased affinity, avidity, and
anti-pathogen activity. It is a result of somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin genes in B cells, coupled to selection for antigen binding.
This process occurs in the germinal centers and proceeds for weeks after acute infection or
vaccination, or for many cycles during chronic infection. The resulting antibodies can be highly
mutated from their germline-encoded counterparts, with increases of several orders of magnitude in affinity for antigen compared to the corresponding naïve B cell receptors (BCRs).
other options:
option A: Isotype switching, also known as class switch recombination, is a process where the
constant region of the antibody heavy chain is changed, leading to a switch in the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG). This process is crucial for the functional properties of antibodies but is not directly involved in affinity maturation.
option C: mRNA splicing is a cellular process that involves the removal of introns and the joining of exons to generate mature mRNA. while this process is essential for the production of
functional antibodies, it is not specifically associated with affinity maturation. Affinity maturation

primarily occurs through somatic hypermutation.
option D: VDJ rearrangement is the process by which the variable regions of immunoglobulin
genes are assembled from gene segments (V, D, and J segments). This process contributes to the diversity of antibodies but is distinct from affinity maturation. Affinity maturation occurs after     VDJ rearrangement and is driven by somatic hypermutation in the variable regions.",,B,
Q26,A farmer presents with a swollen foot and multiple sinuses as shown in the below image. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Mycetoma
b)squamous cell carcinoma
c)Nocardia
d)sporotrichosis","The most likely diagnosis here is Mycetoma which is caused by Eumycetoma.
Mycetoma:-
• Mycetoma is a chronic, granulomatous infection of the skin, subcutaneous tissues, fascia and bone, which most often affects the foot or the hand. It is, therefore, commonly known as
Maduramycosis or Madura foot. Mycetoma occurs worldwide.
• Etiology:  It can be divided into three types, eumycetomas, actinomycetomas and botryomycosis. pathogenesis:-
• Triad of symptoms: Infection follows traumatic inoculation of the organism into the
subcutaneous tissue from soil or vegetable sources, usually on thorns or splinters and results in tumefactions, deformities and draining sinuses discharging fungal colonies called grains or
granules (triad of symptoms).
• subcutaneous tissues of the feet, lower extremities, hands, and exposed areas are most often involved.
• Grains: within host tissues the organisms develop to form compacted colonies (grains) o.5–2
mm in diameter, the color of which depends on the organism responsible.
Laboratory Diagnosis
• A. Direct Examination: The presence of grains in pus collected from draining sinuses or in biopsy material is diagnostic.
• B. culture samples should also be cultured, at both 25–3o°c and 37°c, on brain-heart infusion agar or blood agar for actinomycetes and on sabouraud agar (without cycloheximide) for fungi.
Treatment:-
The management of eumycetoma is difficult, involving surgical debridement or excision and
chemotherapy. Actinomycetoma responds well to rifampicin in combination with sulfonamides or cotrimoxazole.",1411-859.PNG,A,

In about 2o% of patients, paralytic rabies is seen. Flaccid muscle weakness is seen, which progresses to quadriparesis and facial palsy.
Note: In rabid animals, the virus depicts two modes of spread:
• Centripetal spread: The virus enters the peripheral neurons. It moves via retrograde fast axonal   transport towards the spinal cord or brainstem a.k.a the central nervous system (CNS) at a speed   of up to 25o mm/day. once within the CNS, it spreads quickly to other regions in the CNS through fast axonal transport. It infects neurons primarily, but may rarely infect astrocytes.
• Centrifugal spread: After CNS infection is established, it spreads along the sensory and autonomic nerves to salivary glands, adrenal glands, skin
Rabies virus replicates in acinar cells of the salivary glands and is secreted in the saliva of rabid animals that serve as vectors.",,B,
Q31,"A patient presents with a mobile, warm to touch nodule in the neck. on the anaerobic culture of the biopsy material from this swelling, it showed colonies as shown in the image which had gram-positive branching rods on staining. which of the following is the drug of choice in this  condition?","a)Doxycycline
b)cotrimoxazole
c)penicillin
d)surgical drainage","The given image shows molar tooth colonies that are characteristic of Actinomyces species. The given clinical scenario of a mobile, warm to touch nodule in the neck describes cervicofacial
actinomycosis also known as 'lumpy jaw syndrome'. penicillin is the drug of choice for actinomyces infection.
Actinomyces are Gram-positive anaerobic bacilli that produce molar tooth colonies on incubation for 72 hours on brain-heart infusion agar. They cause a chronic suppurative and granulomatous    infection called actinomycosis. It can present as one of the following clinical types:
• cervicofacial type- Fluctuant mass in the jaw area producing draining fistulas.
• Thoracic type- pulmonary infection with fever, cough, and purulent sputum.
• Abdominal type- occurs following ruptured appendix or ulcer. It may spread throughout the peritoneum and involve multiple organs.
Actinomycosis can spread to bones and surrounding tissue and produce multiple discharging sinuses. Treatment requires prolonged administration of penicillin for 6–12 months. In
penicillin-allergic patients, clindamycin or erythromycin is effective. surgical excision and drainage may be required in some cases.
The given image shows cervicofacial actinomycosis.

The various strains of Escherichia coli are:
• Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) is the most common organism that causes diarrhea in travelers. It produces the following toxins:
• LT (heat-labile toxin)- acts by ?cAMP
• ST (heat-stable toxin)- two types of ST are known, ST-A (ST-I) and ST-B (ST-II)
• ST-A is soluble in methanol and acts by ?cGMP in the intestine.
• ST-B is insoluble in methanol, and the mode of action is not known.
• Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) invade interstitial epithelial cells in the intestine and cause a
condition resembling shigellosis. This ability is determined by a plasmid, detection of which can

also be a diagnostic test. sereny's test was employed to diagnose EIEC but it is not in use anymore.
• Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) produces verocytotoxin, which targets vascular endothelium. It causes hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome.
• Enteropathogenic E. coli (EpEC) causes infantile diarrhea in developing countries. It adheres to the mucosal surface of small intestine using EAF and LEE and causes effacement of microvilli.
This leads to attachment and effacement lesions of intestinal cells.
• Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) produces the stacked brick pattern of adherence on hep-2 cells. EAEC has been associated with persistent diarrhea. Intestinal colonization of EAEC is mediated
by AAF (aggregative adherence fimbriae). EAEC produces EAsT-1 toxin (enteroaggregative heat-stable toxin) which is considered to be a major virulence factor.

obligate parasite - organism cannot survive outside host
• No cystic stage. Trophozoites are infective forms
• Sexual transmission is the main route of infection. other modes are fomites, babies during passage through infected birth canal
• Affects squamous epithelium - Intracellular edema and so called chicken-like epithelium, is the most characteristic feature of trichomoniasis
• Habitat: vagina and cervix in female and urethra in males
• clinical features: often asymptomatic in males. In females, it leads to pruritic vaginitis with greenish yellow discharge, strawberry mucosa and dysuria
• Diagnosis: By wet mount microscopy of vaginal or urethral discharge, culture (gold standard -  cysteine-peptone-liver-maltose (cPLM) medium and plastic envelope medium (PEM)), PcR, and by demonstration of antigen in vaginal smear by ELISA
• Treatment: Metronidazole is the drug of choice and simultaneous treatment of both partners is recommended



The given image is the trophozoite form of the Balantidium coli.
Balantidium coli occurs in two stages
• Trophozoites are oval in shape and contain two nuclei. There is the presence of cilia over the
entire surface and are larger around the mouth. Its anterior end is narrow and the posterior end is broad. At the anterior end, there is a groove leading to the mouth (cytostome). posteriorly, there   is a small anal pore (cytopyge).
• cysts are smaller, round with a micronucleus, a macronucleus and many contractile vacuoles. Living trophozoites/cysts are yellowish or greenish in color on wet mount.


The image given above shows Toxoplasma gondii which has two types of life cycles: • Enteric cycle
• Exoenteric cycle

The enteric cycle occurs in definitive hosts such as cats. Exoenteric cycle occurs in intermediate hosts such as humans, mice, rats, etc.
Both sexual reproduction (gametogony) and asexual reproduction (schizogony) occur within the mucosal epithelial cells of the small intestine of the cat.
sporozoites from the oocysts and bradyzoites from the tissue cysts enter the intestinal mucosa and multiply asexually. Tachyzoites are formed within the intermediate host.
Tachyzoites continue to multiply and spread locally by lymphatic system and blood, while the bradyzoites multiply slowly inside the tissue cyst.
The dormant bradyzoites inside the cyst may be reactivated in immune suppression causing renewed infection in the host.

Balamuthia Mandrillaris

B. mandrillaris is a free-living ameba, which is a newly identified species reported to cause granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE).
Morphology
It exists in ameboid trophozoite stage. The flagellate stage is absent
• It is relatively large (12-6o µm), irregular in shape and actively motile by broad pseudopodia.
• Cyst of B. mandrillaris are usually spherical (6-2o µm), surrounded by a three-layered cyst wall:
(1) outer irregular ectocyst, (2) a middle mesocyst and (3) an inner endocyst round wall. under      light microscopy, it appears to have two walls: (1) an outer irregular wall and (2) an inner smooth wall.
