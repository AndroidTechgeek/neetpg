Q1,which of the following nerves is biopsied for the diagnosis of pure neuritic leprosy?,"a)Median nerve
b)Superficial branch of radial nerve
c)ulnar nerve
d)Lateral popliteal nerve","superficial sensory branch of the radial nerve is most commonly used for nerve biopsy in neuritic leprosy.
Although any nerve involved would show the pathology, it is prudent to biopsy a branch of a
sensory nerve, rather than a mixed nerve or major nerve trunk. so, the ulnar nerve will not be the best answer despite it being the most common peripheral nerve involved in neuritic leprosy.
The common nerves and sites where nerve biopsy is performed in leprosy are as follows:
• superficial sensory radial nerve branch at the wrist
• ulnar cutaneous nerve near the ulnar border of the base of the hand
• sural nerve near the ankle
Note: Nerve biopsy is the gold standard for confirmation of pure neuritic leprosy.",,B,
Q2,which component of cement causes allergic dermatitis among construction workers in India?,"a)cobalt
b)Nickel
c)Iron
d)chromate","Chromate is the most frequent allergen in cement causing occupational contact dermatitis. The
most common allergen causing allergic contact dermatitis in India is nickel. It is commonly found in artificial jewelry. However, among construction workers, chromate is more common than
nickel. The reported prevalence of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) to chromate among construction workers is usually more than 1o%.
Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is an inflammatory condition caused due to a delayed
hypersensitivity reaction (Type 4 hypersensitivity) to a specific allergen that comes into direct
contact with the skin. some common allergens include nickel (found in artificial jewelry),
ppD/para phenylene diamine (in hair dye), chromate (in cement), rubber or latex, cosmetics, etc. patch test is used for the diagnosis of ACD.
patients usually present with pruritus, erythema, swelling, papules, and papulovesicles. In severe cases, large vesicles or blisters may form due to the disruption of the intercellular bridges. If
exposure persists the affected area becomes dry, scaly, and thicker with lichenification and
fissuring develops later. There is involvement of the covered areas as well as the exposed areas.",,D,
Q3,which of the following is a drug used in the treatment of tinea cruris for which widespread resistance is found to be developing?,"a)Itraconazole
b)Griseofulvin
c)Terbinafine
d)voriconazole","The use of terbinafine as the agent of choice for tinea cruris and corporis has been limited lately due to the development of resistance.
Tinea cruris (also known as jock itch) is a dermatophyte infection involving the crural fold. The most common cause is Trichophyton rubrum.
T. rubrum isolates have been found to exhibit resistance against terbinafine.
Note: The question is based on research papers about Trichophyton rubrum strains exhibiting primary resistance to terbinafine.",,C,
Q4,"A patient came with a history offever, body ache, and joint pain. He was given NSAIDs. A few days later, he developed brownish pigmentation over the nose. what is the diagnosis?","a)Melasma
b)Fixed drug eruption (FDE)
c)Dengue
d)chikungunya","The given history of fever, joint pain, and centrofacial hyperpigmentation points toward a
diagnosis of chikungunya. post chikungunya pigmentation (pCp) usually appears after the fever subsides and persists for about 3-6 months. Hyperpigmentation associated with chikungunya     fever is macular and most commonly affects the nose and cheeks.
Another close differential is fixed drug eruptions (FDE). FDE has a shorter latency, usually
presents 3o min to 8 h after drug exposure, and recurs at the same location on re-exposure. It presents with hyperpigmented plaques that may be preceded by vesiculobullous lesions.
Hyperpigmentation of the centrofacial region (nose and cheeks) mimics melasma and may be misdiagnosed if proper history is not taken.
Nose pigmentation is striking in cases of chikungunya fever and is termed chik sign. The image below shows chik sign on the nose:





FDE is a type of delayed hypersensitivity reaction.  They occur on lips, hands, legs, face, genitalia, and oral mucosa, and can cause a burning sensation. NSAIDs, paracetamol and co■trimoxazole    are the most common drugs causing FDE. NSAID■induced FDE mainly affects the genitals and     lips.
The image below shows FDE on upper lip area:",,D,3533-2211.PNG;3526-2202.PNG
Q5,A mother has a pearly white papule on her forehead (as shown in the image below) which her infant also develops. what is the cause?,"a)HPV
b)Pox virus
c)Adenovirus
d)Herpes virus","The image shows pearly white umbilicated wart-like lesions with a characteristic dimple at the center, suggestive of molluscum contagiosum, which is caused by pox virus.
The age of peak incidence is between 2 and 5 years. In children, it is mainly caused by the type I molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV-1). There is a relatively higher incidence of MCV■2 type in



adults and HIV infection. Sexually transmitted molluscum contagiosum may be present over the genital area.
It has an incubation period of 2 weeks to 6 months. widespread and refractory lesions are seen most commonly in HIV or patients on immunosuppressive therapy.
It is characterized by the presence of intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies called
Henderson-patterson bodies or molluscum bodies. pseudo-koebner phenomenon is seen, that is, new lesions develop along lines of trauma.
Treatment is usually not required, and lesions are likely to resolve spontaneously. Stimulation of the immune response can be done after destructive or inflammatory therapies with salicylic acid, trichloroacetic acid, and imiquimod. cryotherapy when done needs to be repeated at 3-4 week
intervals. Extensive lesions are treated with an antiviral agent like cidofovir.",3540-2219.PNG,B,
Q6,A disease associated with the occurrence of blistering and peeling of over &gt;3o% of body surface area is usually caused by:,"a)Viral infection
b)Drugs
c)Fungal infection
d)Auto-immunity","Blistering and peeling involving greater than 3o% of the body surface area points to the diagnosis of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). TEN is primarily drug■induced, with a culprit drug being
demonstrated in approximately 85% of cases.
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are both severe
mucocutaneous reactions, characterized by blistering and epithelial sloughing. The two terms
describe phenotypes within a severity spectrum, where SJS is the less extensive form and TEN is the more extensive
common drugs that can cause SJS/TEN are:
• Allopurinol
• NSAIDs- oxicam group
• Anti-epileptics - phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine
• Antibiotics - penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfamethoxazole, sulfasalazine, nevirapine

Disease	Epidermal detachment	purpuric macules and atypica l target lesions
SJS	<1o%	present
overlap SJS-TE N	1o–3o%	present
TEN with spots	>3o%	present
TEN without sp ots	>3o% (large sheets of epider mal loss)	Absent",,B,3547-2223.PNG
Q7,A 23 year old patient presents with lesions in the groin as shown in the image below. which of the following cannot be a cause of these lesions?,"a)Trichophyton
b)Microsporum
c)Aspergillus
d)Epidermophyton","The image shows a well-circumscribed, annular plaque in the groin region which is characteristic of tinea cruris. Tinea cruris is a dermatophytosis. Trichophyton, Microsporum and
Epidermophyton are dermatophytes whereas Aspergillus is not.
Dermatophytes include 3 genera:
• Trichophyton species infect skin, hair, and nails and include T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, T. schoenleinii, and T. violaceum.
• Microsporum contains M. gypseum, M. canis, and M. nanum. These infect only hair and skin (not nails).
• Floccosum is the only species in the genus Epidermophyton, It infects only skin and nails (not hair).
Aspergillus spp. produce large necrotic lesions like ecthyma gangrenosum, and sometimes small papules and cold abscesses.",3541-2220.PNG,C,
Q8,A patient presents with multiple nodulocystic lesions on the face. which among the following is the drug of choice in this condition?,"a)steroids
b)Isotretinoin
c)Erythromycin
d)Tetracycline","The presence of multiple nodulocystic lesions implies that this is a case of severe
acne. Isotretinoin is the first-line drug for the treatment of severe acne (nodular acne and acne conglobata).
systemic retinoids are highly teratogenic and are absolutely contraindicated in pregnant women, those planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding mothers. Two negative pregnancy tests (on  separate occasions) are required for females of childbearing age before starting acitretin or
isotretinoin.



Baseline evaluation of serum lipids, transaminases, and complete blood counts should be done
before starting any systemic retinoids. These values should be checked monthly for the first 3–6
months and once every 3 months thereafter. Monthly pregnancy tests should be done while on the drug.
Note: Female patients should avoid conception for 3 years after discontinuing acitretin treatment for cutaneous psoriasis.",,B,
Q9,what is the type of connective tissue present in the area marked by the arrow in the given image?,"a)Dense regular
b)Dense irregular
c)Loose irregular
d)specialised","The area marked is the reticular dermis. It is made up of dense irregular connective tissue.
It is found in the regions that are under considerable mechanical stress and where protection is given to ensheathed organs. It is usually present in:
• Reticular dermis
• superficial connective tissue sheaths of the muscle and nerves
• Adventitia of large vessels
• capsules of various organs and glands (e.g., testis, sclera, periosteum, perichondrium)
on the other hand, dense regular collagen fibers are found in tendons.",3542-2221.PNG,B,
Q10,The histopathological slide given below is suggestive of:,"a)psoriasis vulgaris
b)Leishmaniasis
c)Mycosis fungoides
d)pemphigus vulgaris","The given slide shows a row of tombstones appearance, which is classically seen in pemphigus vulgaris.
In this condition, there is a suprabasal splitting of the epidermis leading to blister formation. The basal layer remains adherent to the basement membrane and gives the resemblance to a row of    tombstones as shown in the histology image below.






pemphigus vulgaris is a chronic immunobullous disorder characterized by the presence of
antibodies against desmosomal proteins, desmogleins 1 and 3 expressed in the skin and mucosa. Clinically, the patients present with ill-defined, irregular, slow-to-heal oral lesions and
erosions. Flaccid blisters filled with clear fluid may arise on normal skin or an erythematous base. The rupture of such blisters produces painful erosions and heals without scarring.
Nikolsky's sign is positive which is elicited by applying firm tangential sliding pressure with a finger on lesional or perilesional skin. This leads to the separation of the normal■looking
epidermis from the dermis, producing erosion.
Direct immunofluorescence is considered the most accurate confirmatory test of this condition. It shows intercellular IgG and C3 deposition on the surface of keratinocytes throughout the
epidermis in normal, perilesional skin, in a characteristic fishnet/chickenwire appearance as seen below.",3529-2206.PNG,D,3529-2206.PNG;3530-2207.PNG
