Q1,A forest officer develops the lesion as shown in the image. which of the following is not a differential to consider?,"a)scrub typhus
b)KFD
c)cutaneous anthrax
d)Healing brown recluse spider bite","The given image shows the presence of eschar and Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) is not a differential diagnosis for the presence of eschar.
Kyasanur Forest Disease is a hemorrhagic fever found in the state of Karnataka, India. KFD has   an abrupt onset of fever, headache, conjunctivitis, myalgia, and severe prostration. characteristic skin lesions that are associated with KFD are petechial lesions. some cases may develop
hemorrhages in the skin, mucosa, and viscera, but there is no eschar formation.
Infection is transmitted by the bite of ticks, the principal vector being Haemaphysalis spinigera other options:
A) scrub typhus:
• scrub Typhus is also known as chigger-borne typhus.
• scrub typhus is caused by orientia tsutsugamushi.
• The vector is trombiculid mite.
• Humans are infected when they are bitten by the mite larvae known as chiggers.
The incubation period is 1- 3 weeks. The patient typically develops a characteristic eschar at the site of the mite bite as shown in the image below, with regional lymphadenopathy and
maculopapular rash.





C) Cutaneous anthrax:
• In cutaneous anthrax, the lesion starts as a papule 1-3 days after infection and becomes vesicular, containing fluid that may be clear or blood-stained.
• The whole area is congested and edematous and several satellite lesions filled with serum or yellow fluid are arranged around a central necrotic lesion which is covered by a black eschar.
• This lesion is called a malignant pustule.
• The disease used to be common in dock workers, carrying loads of hides and skins on their bare backs and hence known as hide porter’s disease.


D) Healing brown recluse spider bite:
• The bite of the Loxosceles reclusa, the brown recluse spider is usually relatively painless.
• After minutes or hours, severe pain develops at the site, accompanied by erythema, edema, and a central bulla.



• In severe envenomation, a ‘target lesion’ is seen- central blue/ purple discoloration surrounded by an ischemic halo and an outer ring of erythema (the ‘red, white and blue’ sign).
• After 3-4 days, the central area becomes necrotic and an eschar develops.
• The eschar sheds eventually, leaving behind an ulcer, which takes time to heal.",3611-2287.PNG,B,3620-2298.PNG
Q2,A patient presents with following lesions on the genitals. scrapings from the lesion would show?,"a)Tzanck cells
b)cells with clear halo around the nucleus.
c)Molluscum bodies.
d)HP bodies.","The given image shows clusters of vesicles seen on an erythematous base suggesting a diagnosis  of genital herpes. Tzanck cells or multinucleated giant cells with intranuclear bodies are present  on microscopy. Intranuclear inclusion bodies are seen when the smears are stained with Giemsa stain.
The typical herpes lesions are thin-walled, umbilicated vesicles, the roof of which breaks down, leaving tiny superficial ulcers. They heal without scarring. The most common site of cutaneous  lesions in the face - on the cheeks, chin, around the mouth, or on the forehead.
The Tzanck smear technique is a rapid and inexpensive diagnostic method. Scrapings (preferably from the base of vesicles) are obtained from the lesions and smears are prepared. when stained
with 1% aqueous solution of o-toluidine blue for 15 seconds, multinucleated giant cells with    faceted nuclei and homogenously stained ground glass chromatin known as ‘ Tzanck cells’ are seen.
Genital herpes:
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) 2 is more responsible for genital herpes than HSV 1. The
vesiculo-ulcerative lesions are very painful. In men, it occurs mainly on the penis or urethra. In   women, the cervix, vagina, vulva and perineum can all be involved. The primary infection causes serious symptoms accompanied by fever and malaise, followed by recurrent episodes.",3612-2289.PNG,A,Picture37.png
Q3,A young girl presents with leukotrichia and lesions as shown in the image. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Focal vitiligo
b)segmental vitiligo
c)piebaldism
d)Nevus depigmentosus","The image shows areas of localized, unilateral depigmented macules. This feature, along with a
history of leukotrichia suggest that the patient is suffering from segmental vitiligo. It occurs due to a lack of melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis.
It is a localised depigmentation that occurs due to a progressive loss in the melanocytes. It is classified as
• segmental vitiligo- which appears as unilateral maculae in a segmented or band-shaped pattern
• Non-segmental vitiligo- which appears as bilateral maculae distributed in an acrofacial pattern or scattered symmetrically over the entire body
The lesions become apparent between 2o-3o years of age.
Hypopigmented macules in vitiligo are commonly found in the hips, dorsum of the hands/fingers, feet, elbows, knees, and ankle areas. These are the areas of repeated friction. Rarely there may be  complete vitiligo (vitiligo universalis), or trichrome vitiligo where there are areas of
depigmentation, hyperpigmentation, along with the normal skin are present. The koebner phenomenon is the development of lesions at the site of trauma on the uninvolved skin.
several autoimmune conditions can be associated with vitiligo. They are:
• Thyroid disease (hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism )
• pernicious anemia
• Addison disease
• Diabetes
• Hypoparathyroidism
under the wood's lamp examination the depigmented areas emit a bright blue-white fluorescence and appear sharply demarcated.
Treatment involves cosmetic camouflage and the use of sunscreen. The topical application of
corticosteroids is the first line of treatment. Topical calcineurin inhibitors like pimecrolimus,
tacrolimus have also shown to be successful. psoralen photochemotherapy, khellin, selective
ultraviolet B therapy are used as second-line treatment. In patients who do not respond to this
treatment, surgical grafting techniques can be used, where the melanocytes from a normal
pigmented area are transferred to a non pigmented area. In patients with extensive vitiligo where only a few pigmented areas are left, depigmentation can be done.





other options:
A) Focal vitiligo:
These are small isolated depigmented lesions that are neither segmentally distributed nor evolved  into non-segmental lesions after 1-2 years. The focal vitiligo along with isolated mucosal lesions on one site are considered as undetermined /unclassified vitiligo.


C) piebaldism:
It commonly presents with a white V-shaped forelock. it is caused due to the impaired migration of melanocytes to the skin, resulting in hypopigmented patches.





D) Nevus depigmentosus:
It is a congenital pigmentary disorder that presents with a non-progressive hypopigmented
macule. It usually is present from birth or early childhood and remains stable throughout life.",3612-2288.PNG,B,3612-2288.PNG;3623-2299.PNG;3624-2301.PNG
Q4,The most specific and typical sign of juvenile dermatomyositis in a 17-year-old patient is,"a)photosensitive skin rash.
b)Nail bed capillary changes.
c)Gottron’s papules.
d)Malar rash.","Gottron papules are typical and specific sign of juvenile dermatomyositis.
Gottron papules and a heliotropic rash of the eyelids are the classical criteria that are required for the diagnosis of juvenile dermatomyositis along with three of the following:

weakness	symmetricproximal
Muscle enzyme elevation (≥1)	creatine kinaseAspartate ami notransferaseLactate dehydr   ogenaseAldolase
Electromyographic changes	short, small polyphasic moto r unit potentialsFibrillations   positive sharp wavesInsertio   nal irritabilityBizarre, high-fr equency repetitive discharges
Muscle biopsy	NecrosisInflammation

Gottron’s papules are violaceous (of violet color), lichenoid (red-purple), inflammatory, flat-topped papules on proximal interphalangeal joints, distal interphalangeal joints, and
metacarpophalangeal joints.
This should not be confused with Gottron's sign.
Gottron's sign is erythematous or violaceous, macules or patches in the same symmetric
distribution pattern but sparing the interphalangeal spaces and sometimes involving elbows and



knees.
The heliotrope rash is a violet discoloration of the eyelids that may be associated with periorbital edema. Rarely, an erythematous, scaly rash develops on the palms of the children called
‘mechanic hands’. Nail bed capillary changes are visible as individual thickened and telengiectatic
capillary loops, which can be well seen with the help of capillaroscopy. Facial erythema mimicking malar rash of systemic lupus erythematosus, but with the involvement of nasolabial folds are also  common.",,C,3625-2302.PNG
Q5,A child presents to you with itchy lesions on the scalp with hair loss as shown in the image below. what would be the next best step?,"a)KOH mount
b)slit skin mount
c)Gram staining
d)Biopsy","The above image shows tinea capitis, which presents with a well-demarcated scaly patch in which hair shafts are broken off just above the skin resulting in alopecia. KOH mount is useful for the     depicted condition.
The scrapings should be taken from the edge of a lesion and transferred to a slide, to which KOH is added and examined under the microscope for the presence of hyphae. Tinea capitis is a
dermatophyte infection primarily occurring in children. clinical features of tinea capitis are
patchy hair loss, scaling, tender lymphadenopathy, and in severe cases, there might be pustules and crusting of the affected area.
The clinical variants of tinea capitis are:
• Endothrix - a non-inflammatory type in which multiple black dots are present within the areas of alopecia. It is most commonly caused by T. tonsurans and T. violaceum.
• Ectothrix - a mild inflammatory type in which single or multiple scaly patches with hair loss are seen. Microsporum audouinii, M.canis, M.equinnum, and M.ferrugineum cause ectothrix
infection.
• Kerion - a severe inflammatory type that presents with an inflammatory mass with thick crusting and matting of hair with pus and sinus formation. It is commonly caused by T. verrucosum and T. mentagrophytes.



• Favus - is characterized by the presence of yellowish, cup■shaped crusts known as scutula that develop around hair follicles. It is caused by T. schoenleinii.
Treatment:
• Terbinafine: &lt;1o kg- 62.5 mg; 1o-2o kg - 125 mg; &gt;2o kg- 25o mg, all given daily for 4 weeks.
• Itraconazole: 2-4 mg/kg/day for 4-6 weeks.",3613-2290.PNG,A,
Q6,The below-given image is characteristically seen in which of the following type of leprosy?,"a)Borderline lepromatous leprosy
b)Lepromatous leprosy
c)Borderline leprosy
d)Histoid leprosy","The given image shows a case of borderline tuberculous leprosy, or dimorphous leprosy, as
evidenced by the cutaneous, rash-like discoloration of the patient’s skin. This generally overlies the back, and crosses the midline. So, the best choice would be Borderline leprosy.
Microscopically, there is diffuse epithelioid cell granuloma with very scanty lymphocytes and no giant cells; the papillary zone is clear and the nerves are swollen slightly by cellular infiltrate.
Acid-fast bacilli are present in moderate numbers.
The borderline leprosy patients are immunologically unstable and are at an increased risk of developing immune-mediated reactions. Type 1 lepra reactions that occur most commonly in mid-borderline leprosy patients, are delayed hypersensitivity reactions caused by increased    recognition of mycobacterial leprae antigens in skin and nerve sites.",3614-2291.PNG,C,
Q7,"A child presented with itchy plaques over the neck, the bilateral popliteal and cubital fossa. what could be the diagnosis?","a)Atopic dermatitis
b)Dermatitis herpetiformis
c)pemphigus vegetans
d)psoriasis","The given clinical history of itchy plaques over the neck, cubital fossa and popliteal fossa suggests the diagnosis of ‘atopic dermatitis’.
Atopic dermatitis is the cutaneous expression of the atopic state, characterised by a family history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or eczema.
The etiology is only partially defined, but there is a clear genetic predisposition. A characteristic defect is impaired epidermal barrier. In many patients a mutation in gene encoding filaggrin (a  structural protein in the stratum corneum) is responsible. The lesions are distributed in the
flexural aspects.(as shown in the image).
patients may display many immunoregulatory abnormalities, including increased IgE synthesis, increased serum IgE levels, delayed type hypersensitivity reactions.
The cardinal symptom is itching, along with rash.
Atopic Eczema can be divided into 3 phases: Infantile, childhood, and Adult phases.
Infantile phase: The lesions ofAtopic Eczema most frequently start on the face but may occur anywhere on the skin surface. often, the napkin area is relatively spared.
• when the child begins to crawl, the exposed surfaces, especially the extensor aspect of the knees and elbows are most involved.



• The lesions consist of erythema and discrete or confluent oedematous papules. The papules are intensely itchy and may become exudative and crusted as a result of rubbing.
• secondary infection and lymphadenopathy are common.
Childhood phase: From 18 to 24 months onwards, the sites most characteristically involved are
the elbow and knee flexures, a mixture of erythema, crusting, excoriation, hyper■ and
hypopigmentation, and warty lichenification may be seen depending on the skin type on the sides of the neck, wrists, and ankles.
• The sides of the neck may show a striking reticulate pigmentation, sometimes referred to as atopic dirty neck.
• The erythematous and oedematous papules tend to be replaced by lichenification.
Adult phase: The picture is essentially similar to that in later childhood, with lichenification, especially of the flexures and hands.
other options:
B) Dermatitis herpetiformis:
• Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic, intensely pruritic, skin condition associated with gluten■sensitive enteropathy.
• It typically appears in the 4th decade, and the patients present with itching and rash, most typically over the extensor surfaces of the elbows, knees, buttocks, and scalp.
• They may also have symptoms associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathies, like bloating, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal complaints.
• on examination, multiple erythematous papules and vesicles can be seen over the extensor
aspects. They appear symmetrical and heal without scarring. The oral cavity may show mucosal abnormalities and enamel pits.


C) pemphigus vegetans:
It is a rare form of the bullous disorder that presents with large, moist, verrucous, vegetating plaques studded with pustules on the groin, axillae and flexural surfaces.

D) psoriasis:
• plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis and is seen in 8o-9o% of patients.
• The peak on occurrence is between 16 to 22 years and between 57 to 62 years. They usually present with itching and a papulosquamous rash.
• The lesions are red, scaly, and have well demarcation from the normal skin.
• They can also be encircled by a clear peripheral zone which is called the woronoff ring.
• They commonly appear in the scalp, trunk, and extensor surfaces of the limbs.",3615-2293.PNG,A,3627-2303.PNG;3628-2304.PNG
Q8,"A 65-year-old man presents with itchy tense bullae over the limbs. The roof of the bullae collapsed after a few days. A clinical image is shown below, what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Bullous pemphigoid
b)pemphigus vulgaris
c)Dermatitis herpetiformis
d)Linear IgA dermatosis","The given clinical scenario is highly suggestive of bullous pemphigoid.
Bullous pemphigoid is characterized by tense itchy bulla in the flexor areas and trunk which do     not rupture easily. Elderly aged people are usually affected. It is a subepidermal immunobullous   disorder, which occurs due to the production of autoantibodies (IgG) against Bp18o (BpAG2) and Bp 23o (BpAG1) antigens on hemidesmosomes.



Mucosal membrane involvement is rare in this disease. Most of the lesions heal without a scar. since these bullae are subepidermal, pressure over the lesions does not separate the epidermis from the dermis. (Nikolsky sign is negative).
Immunofluorescent microscopy will show the presence of subepidermal split and deposition of IgG antibodies at the dermo-epidermal junction. Histopathology will show the presence of
subepidermal bullae with eosinophils.
It is mainly treated with corticosteroids. other drugs used are azathioprine, dapsone, doxycycline, etc.


The above image (immunofluorescence microscopy) shows linear IgG deposits at the dermo-epidermal junction seen in the bullous pemphigoid.
other options:
option B: pemphigus vulgaris is an intraepidermal immunobullous disease. It occurs commonly between the 4th to 6th decade. They present with flaccid blisters, unlike bullous pemphigoid.
Firm pressure over the lesion separates the epidermis from the dermis. Nikolsky's sign is positive. Mucosal involvement is seen in the form of buccal and palatal erosions.






option C: Dermatitis herpetiformis typically appears in the 4th decade, and the patients present  with itching and rash, most typically over the extensor surfaces. The majority of the patient have symptoms related to gluten-sensitive enteropathies, like bloating, diarrhea, and other
gastrointestinal complaints. Immunofluorescence microscopy will show the deposition of IgA
antibodies in the papillary dermis in a granular or fibrillar pattern(as shown in the below image).





option D: Linear Ig A dermatosis (chronic bullous dermatosis of childhood) is an autoimmune blistering disease seen in infants and children. The disease can also be seen in adults and is
known as Linear IgA disease of adults or IgA bullous pemphigoid. The blisters are arranged in an annular pattern commonly known as the crown of jewels appearance (image below).",3615-2292.PNG,A,3629-2305.PNG;3630-2307.PNG;3630-2306.PNG;3631-2308.PNG;Picture38.png
Q9,A young female presented with the following findings on the face. which among the following will not be useful for its treatment?,"a)Topical benzoyl peroxide
b)Topical fluocinolone
c)Topical tazarotene
d)Topical antibiotics","The age of the patient and the presence of papules and pustules with an erythematous base on the face are suggestive of acne. All the above agents are useful in the treatment of acne except topical   fluocinolone (topical steroid). corticosteroids may provoke an acneform reaction irrespective of      their route of administration.
Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit. It is commonly seen
in teenagers. It can vary from very mild comedonal acne to severe aggressive pustular acne. These



eventually may lead to scarring due to sinus formation.
Acne results from the combination of:
• Increased sebaceous gland activity under the influence of androgens - oily skin
• Abnormal follicular differentiation with increased keratinization- hypercornification of the duct due to increased IL-1
• Microbial hypercolonization of the follicular canal leading to its inflammation.
Management-
• Mild comedonal acne is treated with a topical retinoid. Mild papular and pustular acne is treated with topical retinoid and topical antibiotics.
• Moderate papular/pustular acne and moderate nodular acne are treated with oral antibiotic + topical retinoid with or without benzoyl peroxide.
• severe nodular and conglobate acne are treated with oral isotretinoin.
Tazarotene is a third■generation retinoid, which is available for the treatment of acne.",3616-2294.PNG,B,
Q10,A 45-year-old male patient from Bihar presented with normoanesthetic hypopigmented lesion as shown below. He had a history of fever for a long duration in his childhood. No thickened   nerves were present. what is the probable diagnosis?,"a)Tuberculoid leprosy
b)Lepromatous leprosy
c)Mycosis fungoides
d)post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis","The case presenting with hypopigmented lesions with normal sensations and a history of fever in childhood suggests a diagnosis of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis.
Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a condition when Leishmania donovani is found in the skin and manifests as dermal lesions. It is usually seen in the kala-azar endemic zones i.e.
Bihar, Jharkhand, U.P, west Bengal (Northeastern states of India)
These patients present with erythematous rash and hypopigmented macules similar in appearance and distribution to those of lepromatous leprosy but normally less than 1cm. After a variable
period of years or months, diffuse nodulation begins to develop in these macules.
The rash is progressive over many years and seldom heals spontaneously.
The image below shows post-kala-azar cutaneous leishmaniasis.





other options:
options A and B: The presence of hypopigmented macules over the trunk and face, suggests a differential of leprosy, but the nerves and sensations are normal, hence ruling it out.
option C: Mycosis fungoides is characterized by polymorphic erythematous patches and plaques which are usually associated with severe pruritus. They could be asymptomatic too. The image    below shows characteristic lesions in mycosis fungoides.",3617-2296.PNG,D,3617-2296.PNG;3633-2309.PNG
Q11,A child presented with asymptomatic lesions on the forearm and on the shaft of the penis. The lesions on the forearm are shown below. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Lichen planus
b)Lichen nitidus
c)scrofuloderma
d)scabies","The image shows an aggregate of pinhead-sized papules over the forearm of a child which is suggestive of lichen nitidus.



Lichen nitidus presents with tiny pinhead-sized flesh-colored papules and has a flat or
dome■shaped, shiny surface. They are found on any part of the body but the sites of predilection are the forearms, penis, abdomen, chest, and buttocks.
Lichen nitidus is considered to be a variant of Lichen planus as both are histologically similar in    early stages. It has a ""claw clutching a ball' appearance on histopathological examination. It refers to a sharply circumscribed inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis, that spans 4-5 dermal papillae.
The diagnosis can be made clinically, but skin biopsy provides a definitive diagnosis. Lesions are  usually asymptomatic and rarely require any treatment. symptomatic or generalized lesions can   be treated with fluorinated topical steroids, PUVA, narrow■band UVB phototherapy, astemizole, or acitretin.


other options:
option A: Lichen planus is an idiopathic inflammatory disease affecting the skin and mucous  membrane. It usually presents with pruritic, purple, polygonal, papules. The lesions have thin white lines on their surface known as wickham’s striae.






option C: scabies has typical distribution in the interdigital spaces and burrows are the
characteristic lesions. The below image shows a magnified view of a burrowing trail of the scabies mite.


option D: scrofuloderma results from the direct invasion of the tubercle bacillus into the skin from underlying tuberculous foci.",3617-2295.PNG,B,3634-2312.PNG;3634-2311.PNG;3635-2313.PNG
Q12,which among the following is correct regarding the healing of leprosy if left untreated?,"a)No spontaneous remission is seen
b)Half of the cases resolve spontaneously after bacilli exposure
c)spontaneous remission is more common in children than in adults
d)Indeterminate leprosy have more remission than tuberculoid","Among the given options, Indeterminate leprosy have more remission than tuberculoid is the most appropriate answer.
The manifestations of leprosy depend on the immune response of an individual to the bacillus Mycobacterium leprae. About 8o-9o% of the people do not develop any disease after bacilli
exposure. The remaining patients develop indeterminate leprosy. The lesions of indeterminate leprosy tend to be hypopigmented and ill-defined. Among those patients, 75% undergo
spontaneous remission. very few patients present clinically between tuberculoid or lepromatous leprosy. Therefore, more patients with indeterminate leprosy undergo spontaneous remission
compared with those having tuberculoid leprosy. (option D).
Leprosy (Hansen’s disease) is a chronic infective granulomatous disease caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium leprae.
Leprosy is clinically characterized by one or more of the following features :
• Hypopigmented patches
• partial or total loss of cutaneous sensation in the affected areas
• presence of thickened nerves, and
• presence of acid-fast bacilli in the skin or nasal smears.



option A is incorrect because spontaneous remission is seen with leprosy. Even in the absence of specific treatment, a majority of patients tend to get cured spontaneously.
option B is incorrect because around 8o-9o% of the cases (not half) resolve spontaneously after bacilli exposure.
option C is incorrect because spontaneous remission in children is variable. Even though few  studies mentions that children have more remission, however, the observation period was not long enough to establish its permanence.",,D,
Q13,A young man presented with painful lesions as shown in the image below. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)Herpes zoster
b)Molluscum contagiosum
c)Herpes simplex
d)Lymphangioma circumscriptum","The above image shows unilateral, red, closely grouped vesicles in a single dermatome associated with severe pain is suggestive of herpes zoster or shingles.
It is a segmental eruption due to the reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus from dorsal root ganglia. An earlier infection with varicella is essential before zoster can occur.
The first symptom of zoster is usually pain and it may be accompanied by fever, headache,
malaise, and tenderness localized to areas of one or more dorsal roots. The mucous membranes within the affected dermatomes are involved. The lymph nodes draining the affected area are
enlarged and tender.
The patients are infectious, both from the virus in the lesions and nasopharynx. The most
commonly involved dermatomes in decreasing order of frequency are thoracic &gt; cervical &gt; trigeminal &gt; lumbosacral. The posterior nerve roots and ganglia show inflammatory changes. zoster is a self■limiting infection but it is painful and carries a risk of secondary infection and    post■herpetic neuralgia. Analgesia and treatment of secondary infections are sufficient for mild infections.
Indications for antivirals in VzV (Acyclovir 8oo mg):
• painful zoster infections in adults
• Facial zoster at any age
• Immunocompromised
other options:
option B: The lesions of the molluscum contagiosum are shiny, white, and hemispherical. It is umbilicated with a central pore. It is caused by poxvirus.
The below image shows the lesions seen in Molluscum contagiosum





option C: Herpes simplex virus are classified into two major antigenic types,
• Type 1 (HSV-1) which is classically associated with facial infections;
• Type 2 (HSV-2) which is typically genital.
Below image shows small, closely grouped vesicles on an inflamed base and is characteristic of Herpes Labialis or Cold sore.


option D: Lymphangiomas are dilated dermal lymphatics that blister onto the skin surface. The    fluid is usually clear, but occasionally maybe blood-stained. Lymphangiomas may thrombose and get fibrosed, to form hard nodules in the long term. This may raise concerns about malignancy.
If lymphangiomas are &lt;5 cm across, they are called lymphangioma circumscriptum (shown below), and they are called lymphangioma diffusum if they are more widespread.",3618-2297.PNG,A,3637-2315.PNG;3637-2314.PNG;3638-2316.PNG
