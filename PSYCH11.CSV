d)Binge eating disorder","The probable diagnosis in the given scenario of a 16-year-old girl with intense food cravings followed by self-induced vomiting is bulimia nervosa.



Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder, often seen in young women. It is characterized by
binge-eating episodes, followed by inappropriate, compensatory measures to stop weight gain,
like self-induced vomiting, laxative abuse, diuretics, enema, and emetic abuse. These binge-eating episodes occur at least once a week and are present for at least 3 months. The patient fears
gaining weight and has a relentless drive to be thin.
The weight is normal in most patients with bulimia nervosa. However, few patients may either be overweight or underweight. There is a risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.
Treatment modalities are cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, and antidepressants such as fluoxetine.
other options:
option A: Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that is often seen between the ages of 1o and 3o. Typical features are self-induced starvation, voluntary and unhealthy reduction in weight, intense  drive for thinness, and fear of becoming obese. These symptoms are usually present for at least a   period of 3 months. Associated features can include depression, anxiety, amenorrhea in females,   hypothermia, and bradycardia.
option C: Atypical depression is a type of depression characterized by mood reactivity, which is
brightening of the mood in response to positive events; significant weight gain or increase in
appetite; hypersomnia; leaden paralysis; and/or interpersonal rejection sensitivity, resulting in sig- nificant□ social or occupational impairment.
option D: Binge-eating disorder is the most common eating disorder. It is characterized by rapid intake of abnormally large quantities of food over a short period of time, even when not hungry.   There are feelings of guilt about the eating episodes, but these patients do not compensate in any way following the episodes of binge.","","B",""

postpartum blues, also known as baby blues, is a transient mood disorder characterized by
sadness, tearfulness, confusion, and dysphoria. There are no suicidal thoughts or thoughts of
harming the baby. These symptoms typically develop 3-5 days after delivery. They are thought to be due to hormonal changes, the stress of giving birth, and the responsibilities of motherhood.    They resolve spontaneously within 1o-14 days.
Management involves reassurance, education, and support. The patient must be followed up and assessed if symptoms persist for &gt;2 weeks to evaluate postpartum depression.
other options:
option A: when the symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, insomnia, and weight changes start within 4 weeks as per DSM 5 or 6 weeks as per ICD 11, and the symptoms persist for ≥ 2 weeks, the diagnosis will be postpartum depression. The patient may have occasional thoughts of
harming the baby and suicidal thoughts. It can persist for months to years when untreated.
option C: postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency that usually occurs within 4 weeks after delivery (DSM 5) or 6 weeks after delivery (ICD 11). The predominant symptoms are



hallucinations, delusions, suicidal thoughts, and thoughts of harming the baby. psychotic symptoms such as insomnia, restlessness, labile mood, and agitation are seen.
Lithium, antipsychotics, and an antidepressant is the treatment of choice.
option D: postpartum anxiety is not defined by DSM-5. However, some platforms might describe postpartum anxiety as excessive or severe worry after childbirth.

postpartum depression. It is a neuroactive steroid that enhances the action of GABA in the brain and regulates mood.","","B",""
