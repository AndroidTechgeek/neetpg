Q1,which of the following would be prescribed for simple myopic astigmatism?,"a)+1.oo DS
b)-1.oo Dc X 18o degree
c)-1.oo DS
d)-1.oo DS -1.oo Dc X 18o degree","Among the above options, -1.oo DC × 18o degrees is the correct prescription for simple myopic astigmatism (SMA).
There are 3 components for prescription of glasses.
1. The first number is the refractive power of the spherical component. It is represented as convex (+) or concave (-) dioptre sphere (DS).
2. The second number denotes the power of the cylinder, represented as convex (+) or concave (-)
dioptre cylinder (DC).
3. The above two components are followed by an x representing the axis (orientation) of the cylinder.



In the most common type of SMA - with-the-rule astigmatism - meridian A (represented by 9o   degrees) is more curved than meridian B (represented by 18o degrees). The light rays refracting



from B focus on the retina, whereas those refracting from A focus in front of the retina.
To correct this error, a negative cylindrical lens (DC) is used to focus the myopic rays of meridian A on the retina. This correction needs to occur at 9o degrees (meridian A). The axis of a
cylindrical lens is perpendicular to the required correction and thus, the spectacles will have an axis of 18o degrees.
There is no spherical refractive error since the light rays from meridian B lies on the retina. Thus DS is o.",,B,3001-1826.PNG;3001-1825.PNG
Q2,what is the causative organism of angular conjunctivitis?,"a)Moraxella lacunata
b)Haemophilus influenzae
c)Adeno virus type 32
d)coxackie B virus","Moraxella species, a type of gram-negative diplobacilli, are involved in causing angular
conjunctivitis which is a type of chronic conjunctivitis.
Angular conjunctivitis is a chronic type of conjunctivitis where there is inflammation of the
conjunctiva at the lid margins and the inner and outer canthi of the eyes with red, scaly,
excoriated, macerated and fissured skin at the canthi. This is because of the proteolytic enzymes secreted by the Moraxella species.
patients with angular conjunctivitis usually experience eye irritation, a burning sensation and    collection of dirty-white, foamy discharge at the angles. These patients can also have associated blepharitis and papillary and follicular conjunctivitis.
Causative organisms are Moraxella lacunata, Moraxella axenfeld and Staphylococcus aureus (Rare cause). The source of infection is typically the nasal tract or the nasal discharge of patients with      angular conjunctivitis. The infection spreads from the nasal cavity to the eyes
through contaminated hands or handkerchiefs. Treatment includes oxytetracycline 1% ointment for 1o to 14 days, and zinc oxide as it inhibits proteolytic enzymes.
The image given below shows the eye of a patient infected with angular conjunctivitis.


other options:



option B: Haemophilus influenzae causes acute conjunctivitis.
option c: Adenovirus is the most common cause of viral conjunctivitis and it most commonly
causes follicular conjunctivitis, pharyngoconjunctival fever, and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis.    option D: coxsackie B virus is known to cause aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, pericarditis, and myocarditis. There are no known mentions of ocular disease caused by the virus.

Q3,what is the most common cause of ophthalmia neonatorum in developed countries?,"a)chlamydia
b)Gonorrhoea
c)chemical conjunctivitis
d)Staphylococcus aureus","chlamydia is at present the most common cause of ophthalmia neonatarum in developed countries.
ophthalmia neonatarum also called neonatal conjunctivitis is inflammation of the conjunctiva
occurring in an infant &lt;3o days after birth.It should be ruled out in any infant having discharge or watering within the first week of birth.
causes include:
• chlamydia(option A): neonatal inclusion conjunctivitis caused by serotypes D-K is at present the most common cause in developed countries.
• Gonorrhoea(option B): effective prophylaxis against gonococcal infection and its subsequent decline has almost eliminated it's incidence in developed countries.
• staphylococcus aureus(option D), Haemophilus species, streptococcus haemolyticus, and  streptococcus pneumoniae are other less commonly seen causes of ophthalmia neonatarum



• Herpes simplex ophthalmia neonatrum rarely occurs and is caused by Herpes simplex type 2 virus from the mother.
• chemical conjunctivitis(option c) is caused by the application of prophylactic antibiotics or silver nitrate at the time of birth.

prophylactic treatment: 1% tetracycline or erythromycin eye ointment is applied to the eyes, if the mother is suspected to have gonococcal or chlamydia infection.
curative treatment:
• chlamydia trachomatis (D– K)- Erythromycin eye ointment
• Neisseria gonorrhoeae- ceftriaxone injection, gentamicin drops, bacitracin eye ointment The below image shows an infant presenting with ophthalmia neonatarum.",,A,3004-1828.PNG
Q4,what is the cause of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis?,"a)Enterovirus 68
b)Enterovirus 69
c)Enterovirus 7o
d)Enterovirus 71","Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is caused by picornoviruses namely enterovirus 7o.
Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis also known as ""Apollo conjunctivitis"" is caused by
picornoviruses such as enterovirus 7o and coxsackievirus A24. Rarely it is also caused by adenovirus type 11.



It manifests with severe conjunctival congestion, chemosis, subconjunctival hemorrhages, painful follicular conjunctivitis, tearing, lid edema and pre-auricular lymphadenopathy. The cornea may   demonstrate a fine punctate keratopathy. The disease is usually self-limiting, running a course of  3-7 days.
The image given below shows the eyes of a patient with acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis.


Enterovirus 71 (Option D) is associated with fatal meningitis, encephalitis, and paralysis. It is also implicated in Hand-Foot-Mouth disease(HFMD) and Herpangia which is
papulo-vesiculo-ulcerative rash in oral cavity.",,C,3005-1829.PNG
Q5,1oo-day glaucoma is seen in which of the following conditions?,"a)central retinal vein occlusion
b)Eale's disease
c)central retinal artery occlusion
d)steroid-induced glaucoma","1oo-day glaucoma is a neovascular glaucoma that occurs in ischemic type of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).
It is known as 1oo-day glaucoma because it occurs 3 months after the episode of CRVO. Although neovascular glaucoma occurs as a complication in Eale's disease (Option B) and central retinal
artery occlusion (Option C) and long-term use of topical steroid therapy causes steroid-induced glaucoma (Option D) none of them are termed as 1oo-day glaucoma.
CRVO is further classified into two types:
• Non-ischemic CRVO: occurs secondary to venous stasis.It is the most common type of CRVO of the two.
• Ischemic CRVO: occurs due to acute occlusion of the central retinal vein. It is also termed as hemorrhagic retinopathy.
Ischemic CRVO presents with sudden loss of vision and Relative afferent pupil defect(RAPD).
Fundus examination shows massive enlargement of retinal veins and massive retinal hemorrhages giving a ""splashed tomato appearance"". Other findings include cotton wool spots, optic disc edema and neovascularization at the disc and in the periphery.



pathagnomic features of ischemic CRVO that differentiates it from non-ischemic CRVO are:
• RApD
• Reduced amplitude of B-wave on electroretinogram
• Visual field defects
Complications of the disease:
• Neovascular Glaucoma known as 1oo day glaucoma
• Neovascularisation of iris known as Rubeosis iridis
• Vitreous hemorrhage
• proliferative retinopathy
The below-given fundus image is of the ""splashed tomato"" appearance of CRVO.


Option B: Eales disease is an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the peripheral retinal veins.It is   considered to be a hypersensitivity reaction to the tubercular proteins and it is commonly seen in young males. It is characterized by recurrent vitreous hemorrhage.
Complications include:
• Neovascular glaucoma
• proliferative vitreoretinopathy
• Tractional retinal detachment, • Rubeosis iridis
Option C: Central retinal artery occlusion(CRAO) is most often caused due to an embolus from an atherosclerotic plaque. It presents as sudden painless loss of vision and amaurosis fugax
(transient monocular blindness that is due to ischemia). Fundus examination shows an opaque, milky-white retina with a cherry-red spot.
Neovascular glaucoma may occur as a delayed complication of CRAO but it is not termed as 1oo day glaucoma.



The below image depicts the fundus image seen in CRAo with the cherry red spot.


option D:Steroid induced glaucoma is a type of secondary open angle glaucoma that usually follows weeks-months of topical steroid therapy.",,A,3006-1830.PNG;3007-1831.PNG
Q6,yoke muscle of the right lateral rectus in dextroversion is the ___________.,"a)Left superior oblique
b)Left medial rectus
c)Left inferior rectus
d)Left superior rectus","The yoke muscle of the Right lateral rectus in right dextroversion is the left medial rectus.
yoke muscles also known as contralateral synergists include a pair of muscles, one from each eye, which contract simultaneously during version movements.
versions are simultaneous movements of both eyes in the same direction, such as dextroversion in which both the eyes move to the right.
Hence, in dextroversion, the right eye is in abduction due to the action of right lateral rectus and the left eye is in adduction by the action of the left medial rectus.
An easy method to determine yoke muscle pairs:
Just take the opposite of each word-
Left  → Right
Superior → Inferior
oblique → Rectus
“Left So and Right IR” are a yoke muscle pair.
other examples of yoke muscles are:
• Right MR and Left LR for levoversion
• Right Io and Left SR - Levoelevation
• Right SR and Left Io - Dextroelevation



• Right IR and Left So - Dextrodepression

Q7,"A patient, 36 hours after cataract surgery, presents with complaints of pain and visual disturbance. His eye is as shown below. what is the management of this condition?","a)Intravenous steroids
b)Intravenous antibiotics
c)Bandage and padding of the eye
d)Intravitreal antibiotics","A post cataract surgery patient presenting within 36 hours of surgery with inflammation,
congestion and hypopyon as seen in the image, is suggestive of acute bacterial endophthalmitis. The treatment of acute bacterial endophthalmitis is intravitreal antibiotics.
Endophthalmitis is an intraocular inflammation affecting the inner structures of the eyeball.
Acute postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis occurs within 1-7 days after cataract surgery and
the most important factor to prevent it is preoperative administration of 5% povidone iodine. The cardinal features of endophthalmitis are pain, swelling of the lid, and a decrease in vision. The
patient classically shows inflammation of the eye, corneal edema and a hypopyon due to the pouring of exudates in the vitreous cavity, anterior chamber, and posterior chamber.
once the endophthalmitis sets in it is important to treat all the cases empirically with a
combination of antibiotics and steroids from the beginning. The various drugs, routes and surgical management used to treat endophthalmitis are as follows:
• The mainstay of treatment is intravitreal injections of antibiotics.
• First choice: vancomycin 1 mg in o.1 mL plus ceftazidime 2.25mg in o.1ml.
• Second choice:vancomycin 1 mg in o.1 mL plus amikacin o.4mg in o.1ml.
• If there is no improvement, a repeat intravitreal injection should be given after 48 hours
• Topical antibiotics are started immediately and used frequently.
• vancomycin (5omg/ml) or cefazolin (5omg/ml)
• Amikacin (2omg/ml) or tobramycin



• systemic antibiotics have a limited role in the treatment but are commonly used in practice.
• steroid therapy includes:
• Intravitreal injection of dexamethasone (o.4mg in o.1ml) which is started along with antibiotics.
• Topical dexamethasone (o.1%)
• oral steroids such as prednisolone are started after 24 hours of intensive antibiotic therapy.
• supportive therapy includes:
• cycloplegics such as atropine 1%
• Anti-glaucoma drugs such as oral acetazolamide or timolol in patients with raised intraocular pressure
• pars plana vitrectomy is done if the patient does not improve with the above therapy in 48-72 hours or   when the visual acuity is reduced to hand movements near the eye
other options:
option A: steroids are given in endophthalmitis to reduce the inflammation of the tissues. The
preferred route of administration is either by intravitreal injections, topical concentrations or oral  route. Intravenous route (option A) of administration of steroids is not used in endophthalmitis.    option B: systemic administration (intravenous) of antibiotics have a limited role in the treatment but are commonly used in practice as an add on.",2998-1824.PNG,D,
Q8,"which of the following is the most common feature of third nerve palsy, in a case of long-standing, uncontrolled diabetes?","a)proptosis
b)pseudoptosis
c)ptosis
d)pupillary dysfunction","The most common feature seen in diabetic oculomotor palsy among the given options is ptosis.
In the anatomical arrangement of the nerve fibers of the 3rd cranial nerve, the fibers controlling    the pupillary reflex are present superficially and are thus spared from diabetic ischemia-induced    injury which starts from the central nerve fibres. Thus, pupil sparing is commonly seen in diabetic patients.
The etiology of diabetic neuropathy is hyperglycemia-induced damage to nerve cells and neuronal ischemic change due to microvascular angiopathy.
Involvement of the third cranial nerve is most common and it often presents with early features of ptosis and diplopia with pupil sparing.
The involvement of levator palpebrae superioris muscle of the eyelid manifests as ptosis and the involvement of extraocular muscles such as medial rectus,inferior rectus and inferior oblique
presents as opthalmoplegia with diplopia. All the muscles mentioned above are supplied by the occulomotor nerve.
Note: Aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery is an important cause of isolated third nerve palsy with involvement of the pupil. This is because the aneurysm impinges on the
superficial pupil nerve fibres of the 3rd cranial nerve.",,C,
Q9,what is the most common site of an orbital blowout fracture?,"a)Medial wall
b)Lateral wall
c)Roof
d)Floor","The most common site of an orbital blowout fracture is the floor of the orbit.
Blow-out fractures are isolated comminunited fractures caused from direct trauma to the orbit
that results in a backward displacement of the eyeball and an increase in the intraorbital pressure. This causes a fracture at the weakest point of the orbital wall which is usually the posteromedial     portion of the maxillary bone in the orbital floor.
The second most common site for orbital blowout fracture is the medial wall of the orbit (option
A).
The fractures of the roof(option C) are relatively rare and most often do not require any
treatment.The lateral wall(option B) of the orbit is the most solid orbital wall and a fracture here is usually seen in injuries with extensive facial damage.
The patient with blow out fracture usually presents with immediate periorbital edema and blood extravasation in and around the orbit. proptosis of the eyeball secondary to orbital edema or
hemorrhage with paresthesia along the infraorbital nerve are also very common.
Imaging by a plain x-ray in water's view or by CT demonstrates depression of bony fragments and orbital contents herniating through the orbital floor into the maxillary antrum. This is called as
the ""hanging drop sign"" or ""tear drop sign"".
Definitive treatment is by surgical repair 1o-14 days after injury with initial supportive
management with analgesics and antibiotics.
The below given CT image shows hanging drop sign.

Q10,"A male patient came with a history of unprotected sexual intercourse around 2o years ago.
Now, he complains of neurological symptoms and visual disturbances. which of the following will be seen on exposure of his pupils to light?","a)pupils react but do not accommodate.
b)pupils accommodate but do not react.
c)pupils neither react not accommodate.
d)pupils react and accommodate.","The patient most likely has acquired syphilis due to unprotected sex and has
developed neurological and visual disturbances secondarily as a complication of neurosyphilis. Argyll-Robertson pupils(ARP) are seen associated with neurosyphilis where the pupils
accommodate but do not react to light.
Argyll Robertson pupil is attributed to a dorsal midbrain lesion of neurosyphilis that affects the pupillary light pathway but spares the more ventrally placed pupillary near reflex
pathway(Accomdation pathway), thereby causing a light-near dissociation.
Features of Argyll Robertson pupil (ARP) include:
• Bilateral small, irregular pupils in dim light
• Accommodation Reflex Present (ARP)- The eye accomdates by constricting the pupil for a near target.
• Light Reflex absent: pupils do not constrict when exposed to bright light.
• cocaine eye drops(mydriatics) induced mydriasis.
other clinical features in neurosyphilis:
• Fleeting and repetitive lancinating pains, primarily in the legs
• acute abdominal pain with vomiting(visceral crisis)
• Tabes dorsalis with Ataxia and gait disturbances due to loss of position sense
• Loss of reflexes in the legs
• Paresthesias, bladder disturbances
other causes of light-near dissociation are:
In unilateral eye



• Adie pupil
• Herpes zoster ophthalmicus
• Aberrant regeneration of the third cranial nerve
In bilateral eyes
• Neurosyphilis
• Type 1 diabetes mellitus
• Myotonic dystrophy
Note: Adie's pupil more commonly manifests in young women with unilateral large regular pupil(Anisocoria) with absent light reflex and sluggish and tonic accomdation reflex.
It is caused by post-ganglionic parasympathetic pupillary supply damage and is usually associated with absent knee jerk.
Adie's pupil constricts with weak pilocarpine (o.1%) drops, while normal pupil and Argyll robertson pupil does not.",,B,
Q11,Roth spots are seen in ________.,"a)Acute leukemia
b)uveal melanoma
c)uveal lymphoma
d)All of the above","Roth's spots are seen in acute leukemia.
Roth's spots are retinal hemorrhages with white or pale center. The white centre due to coagulated fibrin-platelet plug is surrounded by red rim that is caused by hemorrhage.  Roth's spots may be     seen in:
• subacute bacterial endocarditis
• Leukemia
• Diabetes
• sickle cell retinopathy
• Hypertensive retinopathy
• HIV retinopathy
• systemic lupus erythematosus
The fundus image below shows Roth's spots.





option B: uveal melanoma devolps due to malignant transformation of the normal melanocytes     present in the uveal tissue. primary posterior uveal melanoma (choroidal melanoma) which forms the majority of uveal melanoma manifests as:
• A solitary elevated subretinal grey-brown dome shaped mass
• ""Collar stud"" appearance on B-scan - when the tumor breaks through the Bruchs membrane and protrudes into subretinal space
• ""Double circulation"" sign
primary anterior uveal melanoma frequently involves the iris and presents as nodular melanocytic mass on the iris. The below given fundus image shows the ""double circulation sign"" of choroidal
melanoma.


option C: uveal lymphoma is characterized by localized or diffuse uveal infiltrates of malignant lymphoma cells. Fundus examination in these patients show diffuse creamy thickening of
posterior uvea with nodular accentuation.",,A,3013-1836.PNG;3013-1835.PNG
Q12,A 5o-year-old man is presbyopic. The power of his prescription glasses should be _______.,"a)+1.75D
b)+1.5D
c)+2D
d)+2.25D","The power of prescription glasses for a 5o-year-old woman should be +1.5D.
presbyopia is the condition of decreasing near vision due to an age-related decrease in the magnitude of accommodation.
Basic principles for correction in presbyopic patients are given below:
• correct any refractive error for distance present in the patient first.
• Add the presbyopic correction(correction for near vision) of each eye to any distant correction that is present.
• For presbyopic correction, the weakest convex lens(plus lens) with which the patient can see clearly at the near point is prescribed, since over-correction will also result in eye fatigue
symptoms.
presbyopic spectacles may be unifocal, bifocal or Multifocal.
A rough prescription of presbyopic glasses can be made by the age of the patient in an emmetrope as follows:

Age	power
45 ye ars	+1 to +1.25 D
5o ye ars	+1.5 to 1.75 D
55 ye ars	+2 to +2.25 D
