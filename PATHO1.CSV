Q2,A 3o-year-old woman presented with painful blisters on the skin and oral mucosa. Direct immunofluorescence is given below. which of the following is false regarding the same?,"a)Antibodies against desmoglein 3
b)Antibodies against desmoglein 1
c)suprabasal acantholytic blister is a characteristic feature
d)Antibodies against hemidesmosomes","Antibodies against hemidesmosomes is the false statement as the given image shows a
characteristic fish-net appearance on direct immunofluorescence, which is diagnostic of
pemphigus vulgaris. The antibodies are against the desmosomal adhesion proteins such as desmogleins 1 and 3.
This pattern is due to intraepidermal intercellular deposition of IgG and c3.
The first-line investigation in pemphigus vulgaris is the Tzanck smear. It allows us to visualize the histology by collecting material from the floor of a fresh blister that is stained with Giemsa or any  Romanowsky stain. Tzanck cells are seen on microscopy.





Direct immunofluorescence microscopy (DIF) is the most accurate test.

• Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor of Lung",,D,
Q5,which of the following is true regarding the internal iron homeostasis in iron-deficiency anaemia?,"a)Ferritin mRNA concentration iron-responsive element increases and ferritin synthesis decreases
b)Transferrin receptor 1 iron-responsive elements increases transferrin receptor mRNA concentration and synthesis
c)Transferrin receptor 1 iron responsive elements decreases transferrin receptor mRNA concentration and synthesis
d)Ferritin mRNA concentration iron responsive element decreases and ferritin synthesis increases","In iron deficiency anaemia, there is an increase in transferrin receptor mRNA concentration and synthesis.
Iron absorbed through diet or which is released from circulation is bound to transferrin (iron
transfer protein). when erythropoiesis is stimulated, iron-transferrin complexes act as transferrin receptors on the surface of bone marrow erythroid cells. Through receptor-mediated endocytosis, this complex is internalised.
This iron is then made available for heme synthesis while the transferrin-receptor complex is
recycled to the surface of the cell, from where the transferrin is released back into circulation and the transferrin receptor re-anchors into the cell membrane. The excess iron after hemoglobin
synthesis binds to apoferritin (storage protein), forming ferritin.
senescent RBCs undergo phagocytosis in the cells of the reticuloendothelial system. The
hemoglobin is broken down, the globin and other proteins are returned to the amino acid pool,   and the iron is shuttled back to the surface of the reticuloendothelial cell, where it is taken up by transferrin via ferroportin (iron export channel).
There is no regulated excretory pathway for iron, and the only mechanisms by which iron is lost   are blood loss (via gastrointestinal bleeding, menstruation, or other forms of bleeding) and the      loss of epithelial cells from the skin, gut, and genitourinary tract. The normal daily iron loss from the body is 1-2 mg.

The given slide shows sheets of large lymphoid cells with irregular vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli typical of DLBCL.
Approach to the question:
• In the given case, Monospot test negative rules out Infectious Mononucleosis and the
identification of Reed-Sternberg cell and their variant is essential for the diagnosis of Hodgkin Lymphoma, which can also be ruled out.
• EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer is a localized lymphoproliferative disorder in
immunocompromised patients. It is a self-limiting ulcer which reverts on treatment in
Immunocompromised people. Histologically characterized by atypical large B cells with RS cell-like morphology. Hence, this is also ruled out.
• EBV positive DLBL(Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma) occurs in patients more than 5o years of     age and without a previous history of lymphoma. DLBCL typically presents as a rapidly enlarging mass at a nodal or extranodal site.
• Immunohistochemical studies indicate that EBV+ DLBCL, NoS is molecularly heterogeneous with a prominent background ofT lymphocytes. The cells are positive for CD 2o, CD 79a,

Q33,"During development, thymic cells recognizing self-antigens are removed to prevent autoimmunity. which gene among the following is involved in the process?","a)NOTCH1
b)RB gene
c)CpK gene
d)AIRE","The above process is called central tolerance and the AIRE (AutoImmune REgulator) protein is necessary for this process.
Immature self-reactive T and B lymphocyte clones recognize self-antigens during their maturation in the central lymphoid organs (thymus for T cells, bone marrow for B cells). They are killed or
rendered harmless.
The removal of self reacting T lymphocytes in the thymus is called negative selection/ deletion. For this process, AIRE protein is needed. Mutations in the AIRE gene results in autoimmune
disorders (autoimmune polyendocrinopathy).
B cells undergo a process called receptor editing. when developing B cells encounter an antigen, it formulates a change in the receptor that makes the antigen unrecognizable. self-reacting B cells
can also undergo apoptosis.",,D,

b)All nucleated cells
c)B cells, dendritic cells, mononuclear phagocytes
d)platelets","Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are mainly expressed
on macrophages, B lymphocytes, and dendritic cells. These cells present ingested antigens to T-cells.
The function of MHC molecules is to display peptide fragments of protein antigens for recognition by antigen-specific T cells. In humans, the MHC molecules are called human leukocyte antigens
(HLA) because they were initially detected on leukocytes by the binding of antibodies. The combination of HLA alleles in each individual is called the HLA haplotype.
The genes encoding HLA molecules are clustered on the short arm of chromosome 6.
uses of MHC/ HLA typing include:
• Anthropology
• Transfusion
• paternity testing
• Forensic science
• Transplantation
• Disease correlation",,C,
