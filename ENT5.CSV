Q1,which of the following is an indication of high tracheostomy?,"a)vocal cord palsy
b)Tracheomalacia
c)Foreign body obstruction
d)suspicion of Laryngeal carcinoma planned for surgery later","Laryngeal carcinoma is an indication of high tracheostomy. It is done at the level of the 1st tracheal ring and an opening is made above the isthmus of the thyroid gland.
The disadvantage of a high tracheostomy is subglottic stenosis at the level of the cricoid and
perichondritis of the cricoid. However, in laryngeal carcinoma this would be a temporary measure as the definitive management is total laryngectomy.
Tracheostomy involves making an opening and placing a stoma in the anterior wall of the trachea.
Functions:
• provides an alternative pathway for breathing by bypassing the obstruction.
• Improves alveolar ventilation by reducing dead space by 3o-5o% and reducing airway resistance
• uses a cuff to protect the airways from secretions and blood
• Allows suction of secretions in the setting of the impaired cough reflex.
• Allows positive pressure respiration
• Allows administration of anesthesia
Indications:
• Respiratory obstruction due to
• Infections (laryngo-tracheo-bronchitis, epiglottitis)
• Trauma due to external injury, mandibular or maxillofacial fractures
• Neoplasms
• Foreign bodies or edema
• Bilateral abductor paralysis
• congenital anomalies



• Retained secretions
• Inability to cough due to coma, spasm, or paralysis of respiratory muscles
• Aspiration of pharyngeal secretions
• painful cough
• Respiratory insufficiency due to emphysema, chronic bronchitis",,D,
Q2,which of the following nerves is responsible for referred otalgia from tonsillitis?,"a)Glossopharyngeal nerve
b)Facial nerve
c)Trigeminal nerve
d)vagus nerve","The tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX) is responsible for referred otalgia from tonsillitis.
The tonsils and tonsillar fossa are supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve. The glossopharyngeal  nerve and the styloid process lie in relation to the lower part of the tonsillar fossa. Therefore, any irritation or pain can be referred to the ear along the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal
(Jacobson's) nerve.
causes of referred otalgia via the glossopharyngeal nerve include acute pharyngitis, tonsillitis,  peritonsillar abscess, post-tonsillectomy, foreign bodies embedded in the base of the tongue or tonsillar area and an elongated styloid process (Eagle's syndrome).
The ear receives extensive sensory innervation via four cranial nerves (V, VII, IX, and X) and two spinal segments (c2 and c3).

Q3,water’s view is used to best visualize which of the following sinuses?,"a)Maxillary sinus
b)Ethmoidal sinus
c)Frontal sinus
d)sphenoid sinus","water’s view is used to best visualize the maxillary sinus. Frontal and ethmoidal sinuses can also be visualized. sphenoid sinus can be seen in water's view with open mouth.



It is also known as the occipitomental view. The X-ray beam is angled at 37°-45° to the orbitomeatal line.
The recommended imaging views for different sinuses are as follows:
• Ethmoidal sinus: Rheese's view
• Frontal sinus: caldwell's view
• sphenoid sinus: Hirtz view",,A,3244-2005.PNG;3244-2004.PNG
Q4,The following instrument is used for:,"a)septoplasty
b)Myringoplasty
c)Myringotomy
d)Adenoidectomy",The given instrument with an arrowed blade and angled shank is a myringotome. It is used for myringotomy.,3241-2002.PNG,C,
Q5,The vertical fracture of the nasal septum is known as _______.,"a)chevallet fracture
b)citelli fracture
c)Tripod fracture
d)Jarjaway fracture","A chevallet fracture usually results from a blow to the nose from below. This fracture line
runs vertically. It extends from the anterior nasal spine upwards to the junction of the bony and cartilaginous dorsum of the nose.
Injuries to the nasal septum can result from trauma to the nose from the front, side, or below. The septum may get buckled on itself, fracture vertically and horizontally, or get crushed
A Jarjaway fracture (option D) results from a blow to the nose from the front. The fracture line   runs horizontally backward. It begins just above the anterior nasal spine and extends just above the junction of septal cartilage with the vomer.


Early recognition and treatment of septal injuries are crucial, including drainage of hematomas.
Dislocated or fractured septal fragments should be repositioned and supported between
mucoperichondrial flaps using mattress sutures and nasal packing. Nasal pyramid fractures often coincide with septal fractures and should be treated simultaneously.
Neglecting injuries to the septum can lead to deviations in the cartilaginous nose, as well as asymmetry in the nasal tip, columella, or nostrils.
other options:
option B: citelli fracture is a term that does not exist. citelli's abscess is an extratemporal complication of otitis media, occurring behind the mastoid, more towards the occipital
bone. citelli's angle refers to the sino-dural angle between the sigmoid sinus and middle cranial fossa dural plate. It is an important landmark in mastoidectomy.
option c: A tripod fracture refers to a fracture of the zygomatic complex. There are three
commonly occurring disruptions - frontozygomatic, infraorbital rim and the zygomaticomaxillary buttress.",,A,3245-2006.PNG
Q6,where is the electrode placed in cochlear implant procedures?,"a)Round window
b)oval window
c)scala vestibuli
d)scala tympani","The electrode of a cochlear implant is placed in the scala tympani. It allows for the electrodes to be in close proximity to the ganglion cells and their dendrites which are located in the modiolus and bony spiral lamina of the cochlea.
A cochlear implant is an electronic device for severe to profound SNHL and who cannot benefit     from a hearing aid. It converts sound to an electrical signal (transduction) and delivers this to the auditory nerve. prerequisites include an intact cochlear nerve and higher auditory pathway.
In the auditory brainstem implant, the site of the implant is the lateral recess of the
fourth ventricle. It is used when the cochlear nerve is not intact.",,D,3246-2007.PNG
