Q1,which of the following is true about celiac disease?,"a)Most common cause of malnutrition in developing countries
b)can be diagnosed with cEcT
c)Improves with food rich in carbohydrates
d)Increased risk of GI lymphoma","Individuals with celiac disease have an increased risk of GI lymphoma.
celiac disease is a common cause of diarrhea in developed countries. It is due to permanent
sensitivity to gluten in susceptible individuals. It results in partial or total villous atrophy that can



be seen on histopathological examination of biopsy samples. CECT is not a modality of diagnosis. The treatment is lifelong gluten free diet.",,D,
Q2,cells lining the isthmus of the gastric pits,"a)chief cells
b)stem cells
c)parietal cells
d)Mucous cells","stem cells are the cells lining the isthmus of the gastric pits.
Isthmus is the narrow, upper-third segment of the gastric gland. This region has stem cells and
mucous neck cells. Most stem cells constantly regenerate and primarily mature to form mucous    neck cells that migrate upwards and form mucosa. some stem cells differentiate into mature cells (unknown) and move to the base of the gastric gland.",,B,1908-1204.PNG
Q3,which of the following is not true about stem cells?,"a)They can differentiate
b)They can replicate
c)They can divide without any regulatory stimulus
d)They can regenerate damaged tissues","stem cells do not divide without any regulatory stimulus.
stem cells give rise to all the various differentiated tissues. In adults, stem cells replace damaged cells and maintain tissue populations.
The properties of stem cells are:
• self-renewal
• Asymmetric division - In which one daughter cell enters a differentiation pathway and gives rise to mature cells, while the other remains undifferentiated and retains its self-renewal capacity.
The types of stem cells are:
• Embryonic stem cells which are totipotent
• Adult stem cells present in stem cell niches
The pluripotency of stem cells is due to factors like:



• oct3/4
• klf 4
• Sox 2
• cMyc",,C,
Q4,which of the following is true regarding liquid-based cytology?,"a)urine specimen is used
b)sanger sequencing is used
c)study of fluid in tumour microenvironment
d)DNA is collected in microvessels","Liquid-based cytology can also be done using a urine specimen. It is commonly used in cervical cancer screening in place of a pap smear.
The advantages of liquid-based cytology are:
• The process reduces obscuring inflammatory cells and mucous, blood, and debris
• The cells are deposited on the slide in a monolayer.
• Test sensitivity is improved compared with conventional pap tests.
Liquid-based cytology has found broad acceptance in non-gynecologic cytopreparation such as:
• Thyroid cyst fluid examination.
• oral pathology: diagnostic for various types of oral lesions.
• This technique is also used to body fluids (e.g. urine, pleural effusions), brushing samples (e.g. gastrointestinal tract, lung), and fine needle aspiration.",,A,
Q5,which of the following is true regarding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency?,"a)spectrin defect
b)cells are spherical
c)cells don't lyse in hypotonic solution
d)cells lyse in hypertonic solution","G6PD deficiency has spherical red cells (Spherocytes).
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an enzyme that helps in the synthesis of NADPH.  NADPH helps in keeping glutathione in a reduced state (GSH). This reduced glutathione acts as a defense against oxidative damage. In G6PD deficiency, RBCs are exposed to oxidants. These
cross-linking of the reactive sulphydryl groups in the globin chain of hemoglobin. These are then deposited as inclusions in RBC membranes as Heinz bodies. when these RBCs pass-through
spleen, macrophages pluck out these membrane inclusions. The remaining cells are seen as bite cells. Less severely damaged cells lose a part of their membrane, forming spherocytes.
Spectrin is a part of the RBC membrane skeleton. It is commonly defective in hereditary spherocytosis.
Normal biconcave RBCs have a bit of an 'extra space'. They can accommodate a little fluid when   exposed to a hypotonic solution. But spherocytes have already lost a part of its membrane, so are relatively full. Hence if they are placed in a hypotonic solution, they absorb more fluid and result in lysis of RBCs. This forms the basis of testing spherocytes in Hereditary spherocytosis or G6PD and is known as osmotic fragility testing.
on the other hand, placing RBCs in a hypertonic solution may cause them to lose water and shrink in size. But hardly any hemolysis takes place.",,B,
Q6,"A woman who had undergone total knee replacement surgery comes with complaints of knee  pain with the loosening of implants. The following histopathological slide was obtained which showed foreign body giant cells along with the appearance highlighted in the image below.
what is your diagnosis?","a)ochronisis
b)Metallosis
c)Malignant melanoma
d)Rosai dorffman disease","The given clinical scenario and image with the said foreign body giant cell point towards a diagnosis of metallosis.
Metallosis is an uncommon complication following total joint replacements of high wear joints
like hip and knees. The metal from the prosthesis infiltrates the bone and soft tissue surrounding it. It presents with pain or squeaking on weight bearing or loosening of implant. sometimes it
may be asymptomatic with imaging findings (cloud sign or bubble sign). Aspiration reveals dark fluid consisting of metallic debris.",1897-1198.PNG,B,
Q7,"A 24-year-old man met with an RTA and was brought to the casualty after 6 hours. His B.P. was 9o/6o mm Hg, heart rate was 11o/min, and Spo2 was 92%. A blood transfusion was
done. After a few hours, the patient is febrile, tachypneic, and starts bleeding from the IV and NG tube sites. His Spo2 levels started falling. what could be the cause?","a)Transfusion reaction
b)Acute adrenal crisis
c)Fat embolism
d)Hemorrhagic shock","The symptoms of this patient (bleeding from the IV catheter and nasogastric tube sites) are
suggestive of DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) within a few hours of blood
transfusion. Hence, the most likely cause of this presentation is an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction.
These reactions are mediated by pre-existing IgM antibodies that act against the polysaccharide blood group antigens A or B. They bind to the red cells and cause complement-mediated lysis     which further leads to intravascular hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. severe cases may present     with DIC, which is a consumptive coagulopathy with bleeding manifestations. other
complications include shock, acute kidney injury, and sometimes, death.
The various blood transfusion reactions according to their time of occurrence are as follows:
• Anaphylactic reaction - within a few seconds to minutes of the transfusion
• Allergic/urticarial reactions - within 2-3 hours of transfusion
• Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR) - within 24 hours of transfusion
• Febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR) - within 6 hours of transfusion
• Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) - After 24 hours of transfusion
other options:
option b- Acute adrenal crisis usually presents as an unexplained shock that is refractory to fluids and vasopressors.
option c- Fat embolism is associated with fractures of the long bones. It develops within 2-3 days of fracture/trauma. Moreover, a history of petechial rash is characteristic of fat embolism.
option d- Hemorrhagic shock presents as tachypnea, tachycardia, narrow pulse pressure, and oliguria. Cold extremities and delayed capillary refill time are other features. In this case,
hemorrhagic shock might occur as a consequence of bleeding due to DIC, but the cause of this presentation is transfusion reaction.",,A,
Q8,which of the following is not a component of Papanicolaou stain?,"a)Light green SF
b)orange G
c)Eosin B
d)Hematoxylin","Eosin B is not a component of papanicolaou stain.
papanicolaou stain is the most popular stain used in the practice of histopathology. It is a
polychrome stain containing multiple dyes to stain the various components of cells differentially. papanicolaou stain includes both acidic and basic dyes:
• Hematoxylin is a basic dye and it stains the nucleus.
• orange G is an acidic counterstain and it stains matured and keratinized cells.
• Eosin A is the second counterstain and it is a polychrome mixture of Eosin Y and Light green sF.",,C,
Q9,The vacutainer tube shown in the given image contains:,"a)Na-EDTA
b)Trisodium citrate
c)NAF-heparin
d)clot activator","The plastic tube shown in the given image has a red stopper, hence it contains clot activator.
Red stopper plastic tubes contain silica as a clot activator. They are used for serum chemistry tests, serology tests, and in blood banks, where both serum and red blood cells may be used.
The tubes are inverted five times to initiate the clotting process.

Q10,All of the following are crosslinking fixatives except?,"a)Glutaraldehyde
b)Formaldehyde
c)Methanol
d)osmium tetraoxide","Methanol is not a crosslinking fixative. It is a dehydrant coagulant fixative.
Fixation of tissues can be done by physical or chemical methods.
physical methods include heating, microwaving, and freeze-drying.
chemical methods: These methods are commonly used in the processing of tissue for various histopathological diagnoses. It includes the use of:



• cross-linking fixatives: These fixatives add covalent reactive groups which may induce
cross-links between proteins, individual protein moieties within nucleic acids, and between nucleic acids and proteins. Eg: Formaldehyde and Glutaraldehyde.
• Dehydrant coagulant fixatives: These fixatives remove free water from tissues and precipitate or coagulate the proteins. Eg: ethanol, methanol, and acetone.
• compound fixatives: Fixatives, which are the mixtures of reagents are referred to as compound fixatives. Eg: alcoholic formalin fixes tissues in two ways i.e firstly, by adding covalent
hydroxymethyl groups and crosslinking proteins and secondly, by coagulation and dehydration.
Note: osmium tetraoxide causes additive cross-links and is used for ultrastructural visualization of membranes as an additive for post-fixation after glutaraldehyde.",,C,
Q11,All of the following conditions are related to the same core pathology except,"a)Parkinson's disease
b)Alzheimers disease
c)Lewy body dementia
d)Multisystem atrophy","Alzheimer's disease, unlike the rest, is not an alpha-synucleinopathy. It is a β-amyloidopathy characterized by the accumulation of Aβ amyloid protein.

Q12,Isotype switching is seen in ____________,"a)Helper T cells
b)Activated B cells
c)cytotoxic t cells
d)B cells","Isotype switching is seen in activated B cells.
Isotype switching: conversion of one antibody class (isotype) to another resulting from the genetic rearrangement of heavy-chain constant-region genes in activated B cells.
Isotype switching is dependent on the presence of both antigens and cytokines secreted by T-cells. Note: Defect in isotype switching can cause immunodeficiencies known as Hyper IgM syndrome.",,B,
Q13,which of the following caspase binds to cyt c and APAF-1 complex?,"a)caspase 1
b)caspase 8
c)caspase 9
d)Caspase 4","caspase 9 binds to cyt c and APAF-1 complex.
Apoptotic stimuli cause the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. cytochrome-c in turn binds to a protein called APAF-1 (apoptosis-activating factor-1) to form the apoptosome.
This complex is able to bind caspase-9, the critical initiator caspase of the mitochondrial pathway, and this step is responsible for the activation of other caspases.",,C,

Q15,JAK2 mutation is most commonly associated with _____,"a)Polycythemia vera
b)Essential thrombocytosis
c)CML
d)PMF","polycythemia vera is strongly associated with activating point mutations in the tyrosine kinase JAK2.
A mutation in JAK2, a key member of the cytokine intracellular signaling pathway, can be found in 9o–95% of patients with polycythemia vera.
It is characterized by :
• Increased marrow production of red cells, granulocytes, and platelets (panmyelosis)
• Low erythropoietin levels and elevated hematocrit
• Blood viscosity and sludging lead to both thrombosis and bleeding.
• Headache, dizziness, hypertension, dizziness, venous thrombosis (Budd chiari syndrome due to hepatic vein thrombosis), bowel infarction, and stroke.
• Intense pruritus especially aquagenic pruritus
• peptic ulceration, hyperuricemia
• 15% to 2o% of patients after an average period of 1o years -&gt;Myelofibrosis and extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis,



• PCv transforms into AML in 2% of patients.
Primary myelofibrosis
• Marrow fibrosis associated with extramedullary hemopoiesis in the spleen.
• Activating mutation in JAK2 (more commonly) or MPL.
• Presence of neoplastic megakaryocytes, which are responsible for the release of fibrogenic factors like PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) and TGF-β .
• Bone marrow aspiration yields dry tap due to fibrosis of the bone marrow.
• So, bone marrow biopsy is the investigation of choice, which shows the presence of hypocellularity with increased deposition of reticulin inside the marrow, abnormal     megakaryocytes and the characteristic finding of dilated marrow sinusoids.
• Blood shows mild leukocytosis, decreased Hb and hematocrit levels, and elevated LAP scores.
• Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in 5% to 2o% of cases.
Essential thrombocytosis (ET) may also be associated with JAK2, MPL, or CALR mutations.
• Essential thrombocytosis (ET) is often associated with activating point mutations in JAK2 (5o% of cases) or MPL (5% to 1o% of cases), a receptor tyrosine kinase that is normally activated by
thrombopoietin.
• In addition, recent DNA sequencing studies have revealed that most of the remaining cases have mutations in calreticulin (CALR), a protein with several functions in the endoplasmic reticulum     and the cytoplasm. Since JAK2 and calreticulin mutations are mutually exclusive, it is
hypothesized that the calreticulin mutations also increase JAK-STAT signaling through mechanisms that are currently unknown.
CML is the consequence of the balanced translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (t[9;22]). Pv, PMF, and ET are characterized by driver mutations that directly or indirectly constitutively  activate JAK2, a tyrosine kinase essential for the function of the erythropoietin
andthrombopoietin receptors and also utilized by granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor.",,A,
Q16,A 2o-year-old female with easy fatiguability and pallor presented to the OPD. The image of her hand is as given below. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Aplastic anemia
b)Vitamin B12 deficiency
c)Iron deficiency anemia
d)Hypoalbuminemia","Skin hyperpigmentation especially on the dorsum of hands involving the knuckles is seen in
cyanocobalamin or vitamin B12 deficiency which is a causative factor of megaloblastic anaemia.
In megaloblastic anaemia, there is impairment of DNA synthesis that leads to ineffective   hematopoiesis. It also causes distinctive morphologic changes, including abnormally large erythroid precursors and red cells.
Clinical features of megaloblastic anaemia (cyanocobalamin and folate deficiency) include:
Peripheral smear findings:
• Macro-ovalocytes
• Most macrocytes lack the central pallor of normal red cells and even appear hyperchromic, but the MCHC is not elevated.



• Reticulocyte count is low
• Nucleated red cell progenitors occasionally appear in the circulating blood when anaemia is severe
• Neutrophils are also larger than normal (macro polymorphonuclear) and show nuclear hypersegmentation, having five or more nuclear lobules

• sieve-like pattern of chromatin of immature precursors (Megaloblasts)
• Granulocytic precursors also display dysmaturation in the form of giant metamyelocytes and band forms
• Megakaryocytes can be abnormally large and have bizarre, multilobate nuclei
• The derangement in DNA synthesis causes most precursors to undergo apoptosis in the marrow (ineffective hematopoiesis) and leads to pancytopenia",1900-1200.PNG,B,1915-1206.PNG
Q17,Rees and Ecker diluting fluid is used in ______,"a)wintrobe tube
b)wBC Pipette
c)RBC Pipette
d)Hemoglobin pipette","Rees and Ecker's solution is used as a diluting fluid in the RBC pipette for performing platelet counts. Its composition is:
The steps involved in platelet count are:
I - Filling the pipette
• Diluting fluid is drawn to mark 1 of the RBC pipette and expelled
• Blood is aspirated to o.5 mark of the RBCs diluting pipette
• Diluting fluid is aspirated to 1o1 mark
• Blood and diluting fluid are mixed mechanically for 5 min
II - Filling the counting chamber
• Allow the counting chamber to stand for 2o-3o minutes to allow the platelets to settle.
• To prevent drying out of the preparation, it should be kept in a moist atmosphere, this is most easily arranged by placing the filled counting chamber in the bottom of a clean petri dish,
alongside which arrange a small piece of cotton wool which has been soaked in water and squeezed out. petri dish lid is additionally put over the dish.
• After 2o-3ominutes, the counting chamber can be removed and carefully transferred to the microscope stage.
III - Counting the number of platelets
• Focus on the surface ofthe hemocytometer chamber with a high power dry objective. Dim the light to make the thrombocytes visible, and count all of the thrombocytes in the entire center 1  mm2 (erythrocyte counting area) of both sides ofthe hemocytometer. This gives the number of  thrombocytes in o.2 l of 1: 2oo dilution of blood.
• The number of thrombocytes counted X 1ooo 〓 number of thrombocytes/l of undiluted blood.

Q20,"A patient presented to the OPD with long hands and feet, and a protruding lower jaw. which of the following genes is most likely implicated in this scenario?","a)GATA1
b)PIT1
c)TPIT
d)SF1","Mutations of the pituitary-specific gene PIT-1 can lead to the development of a somatroph
adenoma which produces elevated levels of GH Growth hormone (and IGF-1) which can lead to acromegaly as given in the clinical scenario above.
Somatotrophs, mammosomatotrophs, and lactotrophs are derived from stem cells that express the pituitary transcription factor, PIT-1.
If the increased levels of GH are present after closure of the epiphyses, acromegaly develops. In this condition, growth is most conspicuously seen in
• Skin and soft tissues, viscera (thyroid, heart, liver, and adrenals).
• The bones of the face, hands, and feet are thickened and enlarged.
• Bone density may increase (hyperostosis) in both the spine and the hips.
• Enlargement and protusion of the jaw is seen (prognathism), and broadening of the lower face.
• The feet and hands are enlarged, and the fingers become thickened and sausage-like.

Q23,which fixation technique is used for fat in the histopathological examination?,"a)IHC
b)Frozen section
c)Liquid paraffin
d)Formalin fixed","A frozen section is done for the fixation of fats. This ensures that the tissue need not go through routine processing, which can remove lipids.
when the tissue sample goes through rapid freezing, it becomes firmer. The ice acts as an embedding media allowing the tissue to be sectioned.
The temperature range in the cryostat machine usually ranges from o■c to -35■c. The majority   of the tissue can be appropriately sectioned between -15■c to -25■c. Tissue samples that contain water can be sectioned at a higher temperature. The tissues that contain more fat will need to be   cut at a lower temperature.
The stain used for fat is the oil red o stain. It can identify neutral lipids and fatty acids in smears and tissues. It is used in the following conditions:
• Fat emboli in lung tissue
• Renal cell carcinoma
• sebaceous gland tumors ofthe skin
• Lipid-rich carcinomas
Fixatives containing alcohols, or routine processing with clearing, will remove lipids. Fixation can be achieved by the following methods:

Q25,which of the following clotting factor deficiency will not affect clotting in vivo?,"a)Factor VII
b)Factor V
c)Factor XII
d)Factor IX","Factor XII deficiency will not affect the clotting in vivo.
unlike the clotting cascade in the lab (in vitro), the cascade in the body (in vivo) differs slightly - as tissue factor (TF) is the major initiator of the cascade. The TF/VIIa complex is the most
important activator of factor IX and factor IXa/factor VIIIa complex is the most important     activator of factor X. Factor V is involved in both the pathways as shown in the image below.
The coagulation cascade in the laboratory:
• Extrinsic pathway sequence (in a test tube):  Tissue factor → Factor VII → Factor X.
• Intrinsic pathway sequence (in a test tube): Factor XII →  Factor XI → Factor IX → Factor X Laboratory methods to initiate clotting include:
• Intrinsic pathway - adding phospholipids, calcium, and either a negatively charged substance such as glass beads

Q27,The absence of the structure marked as A will present with all except:,"a)pernicious anemia
b)carcinoid syndrome
c)Vit B12 Deficiency
d)zollinger ellison syndrome","The eosinophilic appearing cells marked as A are the parietal cells, the absence of which is not associated with zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The cells marked as B are Chief cells.
zollinger-Ellison syndrome is caused by gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine tumors, which leads to parital cell hyperplasia. Gastrinomas are almost always found in the small intestine or pancreas.   The most remarkable feature found in the stomach is an increase in oxyntic mucosal thickness
due to massive parietal cell hyperplasia.


other options:
option A and C: pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence
of autoantibodies that impairs the production or activity of the intrinsic factor (IF) that is released from the parietal cells, which is required for the uptake of vitamin B12. There are three types of
autoantibodies namely, type I, II, and III. The action of each of these include:
• Autoantibody type I prevents the binding of vitamin B12 to the intrinsic factor (IF).
• Autoantibody type II prevents the binding of vitamin B12-IF complex to the ileal receptors.
• Autoantibody type III acts against the α and β subunits of the gastric proton pump, which impairs the production of intrinsic factor.
These patients also develop chronic atrophic gastritis, characterized by loss of parietal cells, infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells, and megaloblastic changes in mucosal cells.
option B: Gastric carcinoid tumors originate from gastric enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. They are referred to as well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. The peak incidence of carcinoid
tumors is in the 6th decade. These tumors occur throughout the GI tract, most commonly in the appendix, ileum, and rectum, in decreasing order of frequency.
Gastric carcinoid tumors may be associated with endocrine cell hyperplasia, autoimmune chronic atrophic gastritis, MEN-I, and zollinger–Ellison syndrome. Ileal carcinoid may cause carcinoid
syndrome which is characterized by cutaneous flushing, sweating, bronchospasm, colicky abdominal pain, diarrhea, and right-sided cardiac valvular fibrosis.",1904-1203.PNG,D,1923-1209.PNG

Q29,Identify the correct statement regarding immune surveillance.,"a)Anti CTLA 4 Ab is a new modality in the treatment of advanced cancers
b)Mutation of tumor supressor genes decreases antigen toxicity
c)PD1/ PDL1 activation leading to tumor supression
d)Binding of CD28 leads to immune tolerance","Anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab was the first drug to achieve a significant improvement in survival of advanced-stage melanoma. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) plays an    important inhibitory role in the control of T-cell activation.
Ipilimumab is a fully-humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that inhibits cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4).
It has been postulated that anti-CTLA-4 antibodies act by blocking inhibitory signals from effector T-cells, allowing costimulatory signaling and generation of antitumor T-cell responses. In vitro
studies demonstrated also that the antitumor activity of CTLA-4 blockade is mediated by Fc    gamma receptor-expressing macrophage and hypothesized a possible role of regulatory T-cell depletion in the tumor microenvironment.
option B - Mutation of tumor supressor genes is associated with increased risk of cancer. Antigen  toxicity is when the immune response to an antigen is excessive or misdirected, causing damage to tissues or organs.
option C - PD1/PDL1 is an immune checkpoint whose activation inhibits T-cell function and helps with immune tolerance. Blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction using immune checkpoint inhibitors
reactivates T cells and enhances immune responses against tumors.
option D - CD28 is primarily involved in providing the second signal required for T cell
activation. The first signal comes from the interaction between the T cell receptor (TCR) and the antigen presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on antigen-presenting cells     (APCs). without CD28-mediated costimulation, T cells that only receive the TCR signal (without the second signal) can become anergic.",,A,
Q30,Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is seen in:,"a)1, 2, 3
b)1, 2, 3, 4
c)2, 3, 4
d)1, 2","Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is seen in HIV, SLE, CLL, and Hepatitis B. MPGN is caused due to immune-mediated injury. It often presents with a nephritic-nephrotic    picture.
The causes of MPGN are as follows:
• Primary MPGN (Idiopathic)
• Secondary MPGN



• System lupus erythematosus (SLE)
• α1-antitrypsin deficiency
• Infections -  hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, schistosomiasis, endocarditis, infected ventriculoatrial shunts, chronic visceral abscesses
• Malignancies - chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
MPGN is characterized by the proliferation of cells predominantly in the mesangium and the
capillary loops. Hence it is also called mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis. There are 2 types of MPGN:
• Type I - It is characterized by the deposition of immune complexes and mesangiocapillary proliferation.
• Type II - It is now known as dense-deposit disease. It belongs to a group of disorders called C3 glomerulopathies.
Light microscopy findings of MPGN are as follows:
• Lobular glomeruli with proliferating mesangial cells, capillary endothelium, and infiltrating leukocytes (endocapillary proliferation)
• Duplication of the basement membrane gives a double contour or tram-track appearance. It is especially evident in silver or PAS stains.",,B,1925-1210.PNG;1926-1211.PNG

Q33,which of the following statements is correct regarding peutz Jeghers syndrome?,"a)2, 4, and 5
b)1, 2, and 3
c)1, 3, and 4
d)2, 3, and 5","peutz-Jeghers syndrome is an autosomal dominant, hereditary disorder characterized by multiple intestinal hamartomatous polyps having an arborizing pattern of smooth muscle. Germline



heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the STK11 gene are present in approximately half of individuals with familial peutz-Jeghers syndrome.
It is also characterized by mucocutaneous dark blue to brown melanin pigmentation, which is particularly evident on the face, buccal mucosa, hands, feet, perianal and genital regions. This rare syndrome presents at a median age of 11 years.
The hamartomatous polyps seen in peutz-Jeghers syndrome are characterized by a branching network of smooth muscle fibers continuous with the muscularis mucosa that supports the
glandular epithelium of the polyp.
complications:
• peutz-Jeghers polyps can cause intussusception, which is occasionally fatal.
• It is associated with a markedly increased risk of many malignant conditions. Lifetime risk is
approximately 4o% and regular surveillance is recommended from a very young age for sex cord tumors of the testes.
• During later life, there is a risk for gastric and small intestinal cancers, and subsequently for colon, pancreatic, breast, lung, ovarian, and uterine cancers.

• seen in fifth and sixth decades of life
• Has male predominance
• Has (11;14) translocation
• IgH locus on – chromosome 14
• Cyclin D1 locus on – chromosome 11
• overexpression of Cyclin D1 is seen
