Q1,The type of knot seen in the image is:,"a)Half hitch knot
b)Reef knot
c)surgeon’s knot
d)crossed half hitch knot","The given image shows the suture material exiting the knot is on the same side as the entry i.e no cross-over is seen. This is seen in a reef knot.
A knot is a fastening made of threads intertwined together or on themselves. Each knot consists
of- 2 half-hitches placed in sequential throws. squaring refers to tightening the knot/half-hitch in a manner that the threads lay flat due to the alternating direction of half-hitches in adjacent layers.



Types of knots:
• Granny knot: half-hitch over a half-hitch in the same direction. It has better-holding power than half-hitch
• Reef knot: half-hitch followed by a second half-hitch after squaring.
• Triple throw knot: Reef knot with another half-hitch knot for added security. knots made with prolene sutures require 6-8 throws to prevent slippage.
• surgeon’s knot: Modification of the reef knot with two half-hitches in the first layer.
• slip knot: Modification of either granny/reef knot formed when one end of the thread is kept taut while tightening the knot.",4810-3006.PNG,B,4818-3010.PNG
Q2,which of the following drugs causes carcinoma bladder?,"a)cyclophosphamide
b)cisplatin
c)Taxane
d)Tamoxifen","Cyclophosphamide (an alkylating agent) causes bladder cancer
The risk of bladder cancer with cyclophosphamide is directly proportional to the duration and intensity of cyclophosphamide treatment. phosphoramide mustard is the primary mutagenic   metabolite that causes bladder cancer in patients exposed to cyclophosphamide.
painless, gross hematuria is the most common symptom that is indicative of a bladder carcinoma until proven otherwise.
Depending upon the depth of invasion, bladder carcinoma can be divided into
• Flat, non-invasive carcinoma in situ (CIs)
• Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (7o% of cases) - does not invade detrusor muscle but can invade lamina propria.
• Muscle-invasive bladder cancer - invades the detrusor muscle.
Diagnosis is by cystourethroscopy (directly visualizing the growth) and biopsy. Management is as follows:



• Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer:
• Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) followed by intravesical chemotherapy with mitomycin C or epirubicin
• Immunotherapy with regular intravesical instillations of Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) in high-risk tumors.
• Muscle invasive bladder cancer: Radical cystectomy along with urinary diversion procedure and lymph node dissection +/- neoadjuvant chemotherapy
other options:
option B: Cisplatin is an anticancer drug used to treat testicular cancer. It is associated with an increased risk for acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
option C: Taxane is an anticancer drug and is the main component in the treatment regimens of metastatic cancers. Taxane's adverse effects are neutropenia and fluid retention (pulmonary
edema).
option D: Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and is used in the
treatment of estrogen-dependent breast cancer. Due to its partial agonistic activity, it is known to increase endometrial cancer in post-menopausal women.",,A,
Q3,The most common site of branchial cyst is ______.,"a)Junction of upper and middle third ofthe sternomastoid muscle
b)Junction of middle and lower third ofthe sternomastoid muscle
c)Middle ofthe sternomastoid muscle
d)Between the two heads ofthe sternomastoid muscle","The most common site of a branchial cyst is at the junction of the upper and middle third of the sternomastoid muscle at its anterior border.
The below image shows a large right-sided branchial cyst.


Branchial cyst develops due to the persistence of the cervical sinus. The cervical sinus is formed   when the 2nd arch mesoderm overgrows the succeeding arches and overhangs them as shown in the image. The space between the overhanging 2nd pharyngeal arch and the 3rd, 4th, and 6th
arches is called the cervical sinus. The cavity of the cervical sinus is lined by ectoderm and



normally gets obliterated.
Branchial cysts are usually lined by squamous epithelium and contain thick, turbid fluid full of cholesterol crystals. It is fluctuant and may transilluminate when it contains clear fluid.
A branchial fistula may be acquired or congenital. The congenital fistula is seen at the junction of the middle and lower third of the sternomastoid (option B). An acquired fistula is usually seen in  cases of incomplete surgery for the branchial cyst or spontaneous rupture, and it is seen at the
same site as the cyst.",,A,4819-3011.PNG;4820-3012.PNG
Q4,Dohlman’s procedure is for:,"a)Meckel’s diverticulum

Q5,parathyroid gland post surgery is commonly transferred to:,"a)Triceps
b)Biceps
c)sartorius
d)Brachioradialis","The parathyroid is commonly transferred to the brachioradialis muscle post-surgery. This will facilitate easy removal if there is disease recurrence after surgery.



parathyroidectomy is indicated in:
• symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (HpT):
• Asymptomatic primary HpT with:
• raise in serum calcium &gt;1mg/dl of the normal range
• &gt;4oo mg urinary calcium in 24-hour urine test
• &lt; -2.5 Z-score of bone mineral density
• Age &lt;5oyr and failed medical treatment
• severe cases of secondary HpT
parathyroidectomy is performed in neck hyperextension (semi-Fowler position). The thyroid gland is mobilized, and the parathyroid gland with adenoma is identified and resected. The   parathyroid tissue is transplanted to the non-dominant forearm.
pockets are made in the belly of the brachioradialis muscle, and one to two pieces of parathyroid tissue measuring 1 mm each are placed into each pocket. A total of 12 to 14 pieces are
transplanted. This is a type of heterotopic transplant.
Miami criteria (confirm the absence of another hyperactive parathyroid): A drop of parathyroid    hormone intraoperatively, to more than half the maximum value at 1o minutes postresection is    considered an adequate resection in a parathyroid adenoma. However, if there is no drop in pTH level, then a multi-gland disease is suspected and the surgery is converted to a bilateral neck
exploration.
complications of parathyroidectomy include:
• persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism
• Hypoparathyroidism (presenting as hypocalcemia)
• Hungry bone syndrome
• Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve",,D,

Q7,The commonest surgical approach to a retrosternal goiter is via:,"a)Neck
b)chest
c)Median sternotomy
d)None of the above","The commonest surgical approach to a retrosternal goiter is via the neck and the most common type of goitre approached is the secondary retrosternal goiter.
A goiter is considered to be retrosternal if at least 5o% of the thyroid tissue is located
intrathoracically. They can be primary or secondary.
Retrosternal goiter presents with dyspnoea, stridor, and dilated neck veins. pemberton’s sign (venous congestion of the neck on the raising of hands above the head) is seen.
Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the neck is performed to assess the location of the thyroid. The definitive treatment is surgical excision of the ectopic thyroid.

Q10,"In a blast injury, which of the following organs is least vulnerable to the blast wave?","a)GI tract
b)Lungs
c)Liver
d)Ear drum","In a blast injury, the liver is the least vulnerable to blast wave (primary blast) injury.



Blast injury is a complex type of physical trauma resulting from direct or indirect exposure to an explosion. primary blast injuries result from the rapid overpressure or shock waves produced by an explosion. These injuries result from the dramatic changes in barometric pressure projecting  outwards from the point of detonation. They predominantly cause damage to air-filled hollow
organs of the body from rapid pressure change (barotrauma). This includes the middle ear, lungs, and GIT.
The most sensitive and most frequently injured hollow organs are the tympanic membranes &gt;   lungs. Blast damage to the lungs is the most common cause of life-threatening injury following an explosion.
solid organs are the most resistant to blast injuries as the parenchymal disruption requires very high levels of overpressure.
classification of blast injuries:

classification	Explanation	Injury type	Examples
primary blast	Due to air pressure from the blast	shockwave (overpressure)	Tympanic membraneinjury,   blast lung, intestinal blast inj ury

Q11,"A man presents with a slowly progressive swelling over the past 1 and 1/2 years. on
examination, it has a variable consistency and appears as shown in the image. what is the probable cause?","a)Adamantinoma
b)Dermoid cyst
c)pleomorphic adenoma
d)sebaceous cyst","A slowly progressive swelling, with a variable consistency, lifting the ear lobe, is suggestive of pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland.
pleomorphic adenoma, the most common benign salivary gland tumor, primarily affects the
parotid gland, particularly its superficial lobe. It is also referred to as a mixed tumor due to its   combination of epithelial and mesenchymal components. This tumor most commonly occurs in females around the age of 4o.
clinical features:
• painless, slow-growing swelling
• Lobulated, firm, variable in consistency
• Lifts the earlobe
• No facial nerve involvement



• curtain sign positive - cannot be moved above the zygomatic bone.
• In case of deep lobe involvement, tonsils, and faucial pillars will be pushed medially.
• Features of malignancy - a sudden increase in size, ulceration of the overlying skin, facial nerve palsy (involvement of facial nerve), painful swelling, and restriction of jaw movements.
Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAc) is the investigation of choice in diagnosing pleomorphic adenoma. open biopsy is contraindicated due to the chances of injury to the facial nerve.
All tumors of the superficial lobe of the parotid gland should be managed by superficial     parotidectomy. Radical parotidectomy is performed for malignant pleomorphic adenoma.
other options:
option A: Adamantinoma is a low-grade malignant tumor that usually presents with pre-tibial pain and swelling since it most commonly affects the tibial diaphysis.
option B:  Dermoid cysts present as firm painless subcutaneous nodules and are of 4 types:
• sequestration dermoid - sequestration of epithelium during embryological development.
• Tubulodermoid - accumulation of secretions from ectodermal tube/duct
• Implantation dermoid - implantation of the epidermis due to trauma
• Teratomatous dermoid - having all 3 germ layers (ecto, meso, and endoderm)
option D: sebaceous cysts are retention cysts of the sebaceous glands that present as smooth, non-tender, non-transillumination swelling with a punctum (in 7o% of the patients).",4813-3008.PNG,C,
Q12,what is shown in the given image?,"a)Dermoid cyst
b)sebaceous cyst
c)Meningioma
d)post auricular fistula","The image shows a dark-colored summit over a swelling, usually seen in a sebaceous cyst.
sebaceous cysts are the retention cysts of the sebaceous gland that are usually present on the face, scalp, or scrotum. They contain yellowish-white cheesy material with fat and epithelium.
clinical features:
• The swelling is painless, soft, and freely mobile.
• Though non-transilluminating, they are paget's test positive (fluctuant).
• punctum is seen in 7o% of the patients with sebaceous cysts. They are dark in color due to the accumulation of denuded epithelium.
• They also have an unpleasant sebum odor.
• The swelling can ulcerate and become painful (cock’s peculiar tumor).
• some cysts over the scalp may also harden over time (sebaceous horn).
• Many may get infected and lead to abscess formation.
Treatment:
• Excision including skin adjacent to punctum using elliptical incision-dissection method.
• Incision and avulsion of cyst wall.



• In the presence of an abscess, an initial treatment with an incision later followed by excision of the cyst
other options:
option A: Dermoid cysts present as firm painless subcutaneous nodules and are of 4 types:
• sequestration dermoid - sequestration of epithelium during embryological development
• Tubulodermoid - accumulation of secretions from ectodermal tube/duct
• Implantation dermoid - implantation of the epidermis due to trauma
• Teratomatous dermoid - having all 3 germ layers (ecto, meso, and endoderm)
option C: Meningiomas are benign tumors arising from the meningothelial cells of the dura. They present with headaches, seizures, or focal neurological deficits.
option D: postauricular cutaneous mastoid fistula is a rare complication of chronic otitis media that heals very slowly and needs surgical closure.",4814-3009.PNG,B,
Q13,A female patient presents with a breast abscess. An aspiration was attempted under antibiotic cover which failed to reveal any aspirate. what is the next step in management?,"a)Incision and Drainage
b)continue antibiotics only
c)A second attempt at aspiration
d)stop antibiotics as no aspirate was collected","In a patient with a breast abscess, the next step after a failed aspiration is to attempt aspiration once again under antibiotic cover.
Incision and drainage is not preferred, as it can potentially interfere with breastfeeding, and delicate structures such as ducts, lobules, and tubules may be injured, possibly leading to a   non-healing milk fistula.
A breast abscess is a complication of acute mastitis, which is more common in new mothers at the beginning of lactation (lactational mastitis). Non-lactational mastitis is more common in diabetic,  immunosuppressed people and people predisposed by duct ectasia and periareolar infections.
Clinical features of a breast abscess include:
• Fever and malaise
• Localized pain and tenderness
• Redness and swelling of the affected breast
• positive fluctuation test.





An ultrasonogram of the affected breast is performed to confirm the abscess, and treatment proceeds as follows:
• Analgesics, antipyretics, and breast support for pain and fever relief.
• Aspiration is performed under antibiotic cover, and the pus is cultured. If aspiration proves unsuccessful, it should be reattempted after a few days.
• Incision and drainage should be considered in cases of:
• Mastitis unresponsive to antibiotics for 48 hours.
• Brawny induration.
• progressive mastitis with persistent fever Note:

Q14,which nerve is involved in Frey’s syndrome?,"a)Facial Nerve
b)oculomotor nerve
c)Auriculotemporal nerve
d)Glossopharyngeal nerve","The auriculotemporal nerve (V3 nerve) is involved in Frey's syndrome (gustatory sweating).
Frey’s syndrome is also known as Dupuy syndrome or auriculotemporal syndrome. It commonly develops after parotid surgery. It is caused by an aberrant regeneration of post-ganglionic
parasympathetic nerve fibers crossed along the sympathetic pathways to the sweat glands near the parotid region.
clinical features are due to the result of salivary stimulation (by the smell or taste of food) leading to the sweating and flushing of the periauricular region on the involved side of the face. A starch    iodine test is used for diagnosis.
Treatment ranges from antiperspirants (in mild cases) to tympanic neurectomy or botulinum toxin injection (in severe cases). It can be prevented by incorporating careful extracapsular     dissection and closure of the superficial musculoaponeurotic layer during parotidectomy.


other options:
option A: Facial nerve is the 7th cranial nerve that supplies the muscles of the face, and results in facial paralysis if injured during parotidectomy
option B: oculomotor is the 3rd cranial nerve which supplies the extraocular muscles. If injured during ophthalmic surgeries, it results in ocular paralysis and the eye pointing down and out.
option D: Glossopharyngeal nerve is the 9th cranial nerve and its injury causes loss of taste sensation from the posterior 1/3rd of the tongue.",,C,4829-3017.PNG
Q15,which of the following statements is false regarding deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?,"a)Clinical assessment is unreliable
b)Mostly bilateral
c)Most common clinical presentation is pain and tenderness in calf
d)some cases may directly present as pulmonary thromboembolism","Most cases of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are unilateral. It is bilateral in only 3o% of the individuals.
DVT refers to thrombosis of the deep venous system.



caused by:
• postoperative thrombosis (most common cause)
• oral contraceptive pills (ocps)
• After childbirth
• Immobility
sites:
• pelvic veins—common
• Leg veins—common in femoral and popliteal veins (common on the left side).
Fever is the earliest symptom, which is also most commonly accompanied by pain and tenderness in the calf and thigh (option c).
The following signs could be elicited:
• positive Homan's sign: Resistance of calf muscles on passive foreceful dorsiflexion of the foot.
• Mose's sign: Gentle squeezing of the lower part of the calf from side to side is painful.
• Neuhof's sign: Thickening and deep tenderness seen on deep palpation of the calf muscles.
sometimes, the thrombus may get dislodged and present as pulmonary thromboembolism (option
D) with features of dyspnoea, tachypnoea, and chest pain.
clinical features are unreliable for making a definitive diagnosis (option A), and a venous Doppler is the best modality for confirming DVT. It reveals a non-compressible dilated vein. The likelihood of pulmonary embolism can be predicted using modified Wells criteria.
patients with DVT should be immediately started with subcutaneous low molecular weight
heparin (LMWH). If contraindicated due to renal insufficiency or thrombocytopenia-related
conditions, they should be started on fondaparinux (indirect factor xa inhibitor) or bivalirudin (direct thrombin inhibitor). Anticoagulants should be administered for a minimum period of 3 months. Vena cava filters are used in patients with bleeding risks (like hemophilia).",,B,

Q17,which of the following statements is false regarding rectal carcinoma?,"a)Hartmann’s operation is done in elderly debilitated patients
b)Adenocarcinoma is a rare variant of rectal carcinoma
c)Early morning spurious diarrhoea and tenesmus can occur
d)Growth confined to the rectal mucosa is stage A of modified Duke’s staging","Adenocarcinoma is the most common variant of rectal carcinoma.
colorectal cancer is:
• The second most common malignancy globally
• The second most common cancer in women
• The third most common cancer in men



• The fourth most common cause of death due to cancer.
symptoms of rectal carcinoma include:
• painless bleeding - earliest and most common
• Alteration of bowel habits - change in frequency and consistency of the stool
• Tenesmus - unable to pass a motion even when there is the sensation of needing to evacuate the bowel. It is suggestive of a tumor of the lower half of the rectum
• Early morning bloody diarrhea (option C) - passage of blood and mucus in addition to feces. pain and weight loss are usually late symptoms
Abdominal examination and digital rectal examination are used for the primary evaluation. Rigid sigmoidoscopy is performed to obtain a biopsy. A synchronous tumor (primary tumor with a
different origin than the one currently investigated) is excluded by performing a colonoscopy.
Modified Duke’s classification:

A	Growth limited up to the rect al mucosa (option D)
B	B1: Tumor invading muscular is propria, no lymph node in   vasion.B2: Tumors invading i nto or through serosa, no ly    mph node invasion.
C	C1: The tumour did not excee d the bowel wall, lymph node metastasis.C2: Tumour exce  eded the intestinal wall and l  ymph node metastasis.
D	Distant metastasis




surgery is the mainstay of management for rectal carcinoma. Non-operative management is offered to only those patients who have a complete clinical response to neoadjuvant.
The type of surgery depends on multiple factors (size, location, age of the patient, etc). However, the general consensus is:
• Early cancer (T1 and a few T2) is locally excised via the transanal approach.
• Most rectal cancer is treated by anterior resection and colorectal/coloanal anastomosis.
• Low extensive tumors are treated by laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection(ApR) and permanent colostomy.
• Hartmann’s operation (option A) is preferred in old and frail patients due to poor anal sphincter and postoperative incontinence.",,B,4831-3018.PNG

b)Intussusception
c)Acute pancreatitis
d)Crohn’s disease","A gasless abdomen is an X-ray feature that can be seen in acute pancreatitis. patients with acute pancreatitis can have significant vomiting and diarrhea that may produce a gasless abdomen.
common causes of gasless abdomen include:
• High obstruction: gastric outlet obstruction, congenital atresia
• small bowel obstruction
• Bowel ischemia
• Ascites
• Acute pancreatitis
• Gastroenteritis
• Large abdominal mass - due to displacement
• post-surgery following total colectomy, esophagogastrectomy, gastrectomy, and low anterior resection
