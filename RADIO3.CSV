Q1,All lung carcinomas for diagnosis requires CECT thorax but MRI is useful in which of the following:,"a)Small cell lung carcinoma
b)Adenocarcinoma
c)Carcinoid
d)pancoast tumor","MRI is useful in pancoast tumor because of the associated soft tissue infiltration, extent of which can be best visualised using an MRI
pancoast syndrome/superior sulcus tumor results from a local extension of a tumor growing in the apex of the lung, with the involvement of C8, T1, and T2 nerve roots.
It presents with pain that radiates to the ulnar distribution of the arm, often with the destruction of the 1st and 2nd ribs. patients with the central or endobronchial growth of the primary tumor
may present with a cough, hemoptysis, wheeze, stridor, dyspnea, or post-obstructive pneumonitis.
Regional spread can cause
• Tracheal obstruction,
• Esophageal compression with dysphagia
• Recurrent laryngeal paralysis with hoarseness
• phrenic nerve palsy with the elevation of the hemidiaphragm and dyspnea
• sympathetic nerve paralysis with Horner’s syndrome (enophthalmos, ptosis, miosis, and anhydrosis).",,D,
Q2,The following image of a FAST scan in a trauma patient suggests:,"a)positive fast
b)Negative fast
c)Equivocal fast
d)pneumoperitoneum","The image of FAST in a trauma patient suggests positive FAST as there is a fluid collection in the  abdominal cavity. The thin anechoic area located between the liver(on the left) and the kidney(on the right) is a collection of fluid visualized in this RUQ Sonogram image.
FAST stands for Focused assessment with sonography for trauma. It is a rapid diagnostic
examination to assess patients with potential thoracoabdominal injuries. It is performed within 2- -4□ minutes.
Technique:
• patient in the supine position
• 3.5-5.o MHz convex transducer
• Following regions are scanned :
• Subxiphoid: assess for pericardial effusion and left lobe liver injuries
• Right upper quadrant: assess for right liver injuries, right kidney injury, and Morison pouch
• Left upper quadrant: assess for splenic injury and left kidney injury
• Suprapubic region: assess the bladder and pouch of Douglas
An ""extended FAST or eFAST"" scan may be performed: left and right thoracic views to assess for pneumothorax and haemothorax.
Sequentially order of FAST is:- pericardial sac, the Right Upper Quadrant (RUQ), Left Upper Quadrant (LUQ), and pelvis.
4 ‘ps’ are evaluated in sequence: pericardial sac → perihepatic region → perisplenic region → pelvis.
Note:-
In pneumoperitoneum, air is collected in the peritoneal cavity which is usually hyperechoic not anechoic and would appear white in the ultrasound image.",3892-2447.PNG,A,
Q3,The given UsG of lung shows:,"a)stratosphere sign
b)sea shore sign
c)Troposphere sign
d)Mirror image artifact","The given image shows the seashore sign seen in M-mode imaging of the normal lung.
M-mode is defined as the time-motion display of the ultrasound wave along a chosen ultrasound line. with M-Mode, even rapid motions can be displayed, measured, and recorded.
In the M-mode of USG, the motionless portion of the chest above the pleural line creates
horizontal ‘waves', and the sliding below the pleural line creates a granular pattern, the ‘sand’. The resultant picture is one that resembles waves crashing in onto the sand and is therefore called the  ‘seashore sign’ and is present in a normal lung.
option A: Stratosphere sign or barcode sign is a finding in the M-mode seen as parallel horizontal lines above and below the pleural line. This is seen in pneumothorax.
option C: There is no named sign called troposphere sign.



option D: Mirror image artifact is seen when there is a highly reflective surface (eg: Diaphragm) in the path of the primary beam.",3893-2449.PNG,B,
Q4,"An 8-year old child presents with the history of cough for 7 months. He also gives a history of haemoptysis for 1 month and fever for 4 days. The X-ray is given below. what is the
diagnosis?","a)Lung abscess
b)Consolidation
c)Hydatid cyst
d)Thoracic duct malformation","The given X-ray shows opacities in the right middle lobe and history of fever, cough and haemoptysis suggesting consolidation due to lobar pneumonia.",3893-2448.PNG,B,
