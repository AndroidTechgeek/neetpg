Q1,All of the following are features of fragile X syndrome except:,"a)Trinucleotide mutation in FMR-1 gene
b)Mental retardation
c)Micro-orchidism
d)Large everted ears","Macro-orchidism (large testicles) are seen in fragile X syndrome, not micro-orchidism.
Fragile X syndrome is the second most common genetic cause of mental retardation (Down
syndrome being the most common). It is caused by a trinucleotide mutation, characterised by
multiple tandem repeats of the CGG sequence in the familial mental retardation-1 (FMR1) gene. It is associated with the phenomenon of anticipation, where the disease phenotype worsens over
generations within a family.
The affected males are mentally retarded, with an IQ in the range of 2o to 6o.
The characteristic phenotypic features include the following:
• Long face with a large mandible
• Large everted ears
• Macro-orchidism
• Hyperextensible joints
• High arched palate
• Mitral valve prolapse
The given image shows a child suffering from fragile X syndrome.",,C,1954-1222.PNG
Q2,predominantly osteoblastic secondaries are seen in ______,"a)prostate carcinoma
b)Breast carcinoma
c)stomach carcinoma
d)Bone carcinoma","predominantly osteoblastic secondaries are seen in prostate carcinoma.
Metastatic tumors of bone:
Metastatic tumors are the most common form of skeletal malignancy, greatly outnumbering primary bone cancers.
skeletal metastases are typically multifocal. However, carcinomas of the kidney and thyroid may   present with solitary lesions. Most metastases involve the axial skeleton (vertebral column, pelvis, ribs, skull, and sternum). The red marrow in these areas, with its rich capillary network and slow  blood flow, facilitates implantation and growth of the tumor cells.
The radiographic appearance of metastases may be purely lytic (bone destroying), purely blastic (bone forming), or mixed lytic and blastic. Furthermore, some cancers are associated with
predominantly one pattern or the other.
For example, prostatic adenocarcinoma is predominantly blastic whereas carcinomas ofthe kidney, lung, and gastrointestinal tract and malignant melanoma produce lytic lesions.",,A,
Q3,A 55 yr old man is found to have hepatomegaly on physical examination. He also complains of dark tan despite avoiding sun exposure. His liver microscopy is given on the slide below.  This patient most likely suffers from ________,"a)wilson's disease
b)Autoimmune hepatitis
c)Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
d)Hemochromatosis","The patient most likely suffers from hemochromatosis. In the given scenario, the liver microscopy image shows hepatocellular iron, which is stained blue with perl's prussian blue stain.
Hemochromatosis is an inherited or acquired metabolic disorder caused by excessive iron
absorption. Iron overload leads to the accumulation of iron in parenchymal organs such as the liver and pancreas followed by the heart, joints, and endocrine organs.
The image below shows the triad of haemochromatosis.


The image below is the liver microscopy image showing hepatocellular iron, stained with perl's prussian blue.





The total body iron pool ranges from 2 to 6 gm in normal adults. In hemochromatosis, total iron accumulation may exceed 5o gm, more than one-third of which accumulates in the liver.",1948-1219.PNG,D,1955-1223.PNG;1956-1225.PNG
Q4,punched-out ulcers in the esophagus are caused by:,"a)Herpes-simplex virus
b)cytomegalovirus
c)candida
d)Acid","Infection with Herpes simplex virus (HSV) typically results in punched-out ulcers in the esophagus.

Q5,α1-antitrypsin is the major inhibitor of the enzyme ________.,"a)catalase
b)collagenase
c)Elastase
d)phospholipase","α1-antitrypsin is the major inhibitor of the enzyme neutrophil elastase.
• Lysosomal enzymes, if unchecked, can potentiate further inflammation by damaging tissues.
• These harmful proteases, however, are normally controlled by a system of antiproteases in the serum and tissue fluids.
• α1-antitrypsin is the prototype member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily of proteins.
Clinical correlate:
• Alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency (α1-ATD) is caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene located in the long arm of chromosome 14.
• This genetic defect alters the configuration of the α1-antitrypsin molecule and prevents its release from hepatocytes.
• As a result, serum levels of α1-antitrypsin are decreased, leading to low alveolar concentrations, where the α1-antitrypsin molecule normally would provide protection against proteases such
neutrophil elastase.
• The resulting protease excess in alveoli destroys alveolar walls and causes emphysema.",,C,
Q6,All are true about Barrett oesophagus except:,"a)complication of chronic GERD
b)seen in 1o% of individuals with symptomatic GERD
c)Increases risk of squamous cell carcinoma
d)Intestinal metaplasia","Barrett's esophagus increases the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, not squamous cell carcinoma.
Barrett's esophagus is a complication of GERD and it is estimated to occur in as many as 1o% of individuals with symptomatic GERD. Microscopically, it is seen as the replacement of the
squamous esophageal epithelium with goblet cells (intestinal metaplasia).

b)caspase - 3
c)caspase - 9
d)caspase - 8","caspase- 1 activates the biologically active form of IL-1.
IL-1 is involved in pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death that is different from apoptosis
and necrosis. It is involved in the clearance of necrotic and microbe-infected cells. It occurs in the following sequence:
• Activation ofthe inflammasome complex
• Activation of caspase-1
• Generation of IL-1 - results in fever, inflammation, leukocyte recruitment",,A,
Q10,Flask shaped ulcers in the colon are caused by:,"a)Entamoeba Histolytica
b)Giardia lamblia
c)Helicobacter pylori
d)Entamoeba vermicularis","Flask shaped ulcers are classically seen in amoebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica.
In amoebiasis, amoeba attach themselves to the colonic epithelium, induces apoptosis, invade    crypts, and burrow laterally into the lamina propria. This recruits neutrophils and causes tissue damage, resulting in flask-shaped ulcers with a narrow neck and broad base.


clinical manifestations:
• Amebic colitis
• colicky abdominal pains and frequent bowel movements.
• Diarrhea associated with tenesmus and heme-positive stool.
• Trophozoites invade the intestinal mucosa, produce flask-shaped ulcers.
• Amebic Liver Abscess
• Fever is the hallmark of amebic liver abscess
• It is associated with abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and enlargement and tenderness of the liver.



• changes at the base of the right lung, such as elevation of the diaphragm and atelectasis or effusion, may also occur.
• The most common finding is a single abscess in the right hepatic lobe, detected on ultrasonography,computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging.",,A,1960-1229.PNG
Q11,which of the following is true about fever?,"a)Aspirin increases fever by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis
b)PGD2 is responsible for resetting the temperature to a higher level
c)IL-1 is an endogenous pyrogen
d)Fever occurs during inflammation due to release of histamine","IL-1 is an endogenous pyrogen
substances that induce fever are called pyrogens. They may be exogenous or endogenous.
• Endogenous pyrogens - IL-1, TNF, prostaglandins
• Exogenous pyrogens -
• Lipopolysaccharides of bacterial walls
• They stimulate leukocytes to release endogenous pyrogens (IL-1 and TNF)
In the hypothalamus, prostaglandins such as PGE2 stimulate the production of neurotransmitters that reset the temperature setpoint at a higher level. Aspirin decreases fever by inhibiting
prostaglandin synthesis.",,C,
Q12,Identify the anti-apoptotic factor among the following:,"a)P-53
b)K-ras
c)Bcl-2
d)BAK","Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic factor.
The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is initiated by the permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane. This is facilitated by pro-apoptotic proteins (BAX and BAK) and inhibited by      anti-apoptotic proteins.",,C,
Q13,what is the type of necrosis seen in the vessel wall of a patient with polyarteritis nodosa?,"a)Fibrinoid necrosis
b)Gangrenous necrosis
c)Fat necrosis
d)caseous necrosis","Immune reactions involving blood vessels, as seen in the case of polyarteritis nodosa, usually show fibrinoid necrosis. Fibrinoid means fibrin-like.
In some immune disorders, the antigen-antibody complexes get deposited in the blood
vessels. These complexes result in complement activation (type III hypersensitivity) leading to cell injury. This leads to leakage of fibrin out of the blood vessel, giving a pinkish appearance around   the blood vessels.
Fibrinoid necrosis is seen in the following conditions:
• sLE
• Libman-sacks endocarditis
• Arthus reaction
• serum sickness



• polyarteritis nodosa
• post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis
