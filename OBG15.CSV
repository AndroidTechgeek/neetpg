Q1,Identify the image shown below :,"a)ovarian torsion
b)Germ cell tumor
c)ovarian cyst
d)chocolate cyst of ovary","The given image shows a chocolate cyst of the ovary.



chocolate cysts of the ovaries represent the most important manifestation of
endometriosis. ovaries are frequently involved bilaterally. It is lined by columnar epithelium.
Beneath the epithelium, large cells with brown cytoplasm called pseudoxanthoma cells are
present. These are large macrophages or scavenger cells and their brown colouration is due to
ingested blood pigments such as  haemosiderin. They are polyhedral in shape and resemble lutein cells.

Q3,A ventouse vacuum was placed at the flexion point. what is the correct statement regarding flexion point?,"a)3 cm from posterior fontanelle
b)Midpoint of anterior and posterior fontanelle
c)3cm from anterior fontanelle
d)6 cm from posterior fontanelle","An important step in vacuum extraction is proper cup placement over the flexion point which is a point on the sagittal suture that lies 3 cm in front of the posterior fontanelle.





Advantages of correct positioning of the cup in vacuum extraction:
• Maximum traction
• Minimum cup detachment
• Twisting of the fetal head is avoided
• The smallest head diameter is delivered through the pelvic outlet
• The success rate is improved
• Fetal scalp injury rates are lowered
• Perineal trauma is reduced because the smallest fetal head diameter distends the vulva",,A,6285-3884.PNG

other options :
option B: oxytocin is the first-line drug to prevent and treat PPH according to WHo guidelines. carbetocin, which is a long-acting analogue of oxytocin, can also be used.



option C: Mifepristone (RU486) is a progesterone antagonist, which blocks the hormonal action on the endometrium, causing the sloughing and shedding of decidua, preventing implantation.
option D: Methyl ergometrine is contraindicated in hypertensive patients. It is given as an intramuscular injection or slow intravenous to avoid sudden hypertension.",,A,
Q5,A patient with a carcinoma cervix lesion showing cervical growth extending to the pelvic side wall along with the presence of hydronephrosis. what is the stage of the tumour?,"a)II a
b)II b
c)III B
d)III a","Cervical cancer with hydronephrosis is classified as stage III B  according to FIGo staging.
Cervical cancer is the second most common gynaecological cancer. The FIGo staging uses clinical, radiological, or pathological findings to stage cervical cancer from stage I to IV.
stage III cervical carcinoma involves the lower 1/3rd of the vagina, with or without pelvic wall extension, hydronephrosis, and lymph node involvement. It is further staged as follows:
• stage III A: Lower 1/3rd of the vagina involvement, no pelvic wall extension
• stage III B: pelvic wall involvement with or without hydronephrosis or a non-functioning kidney
• stage III C: Involvement of the pelvic and/or paraaortic lymph nodes
• stage III C1: Metastasis to pelvic lymph node only
• stage III C2: Metastasis to para-aortic lymph nodes
Note: If the carcinoma had extended beyond the true pelvis, involving adjacent pelvic organs like the bladder or rectum, it would've been classified as stage IV A.",,C,
Q6,"A 6o-year-old female presented with a mass per vagina, as shown in the image. what is the diagnosis?","a)uterovaginal prolapse grade 1
b)uterovaginal prolapse grade 2
c)uterovaginal prolapse grade 4
d)uterovaginal prolapse grade 3","In the given image, the uterus is visible outside the introitus suggesting the diagnosis of grade IV utero-vaginal prolapse.
The descent of one or more genital organs below their normal anatomical position is called pelvic organ prolapse (pop). It occurs when the muscles and tissues that support the pelvic organs
become weakened or damaged, leading to one or more organs bulging into the vaginal canal.
The image below summarises the various degrees of genital organ prolapse.





Types of vaginal prolapse-
• Anterior vaginal wall: prolapse in the upper two-thirds wall is cystocele and in the lower one-third is urethrocele.
• posterior vaginal wall: prolapse in the upper two-thirds wall is enterocele and in the lower one-third is rectocele.
Image given below shows cystocele.


Treatment options may include pessary, pelvic floor exercises, or surgery depending on the severity of prolapse.",6262-3864-1.png,C,6287-3886.PNG;6287-3885.PNG
Q7,A woman at 37 weeks of gestation comes to the OPD for an antenatal checkup. She is on warfarin for prosthetic valves. what would be the management of this patient?,"a)change to LMwH
b)continue warfarin
c)Immediate LScS
d)Induction of labour","The next appropriate step in the management of a pregnant woman with a prosthetic valve on warfarin therapy at 37 weeks of gestation is to stop warfarin and start low molecular weight
heparin (LMWH).
Warfarin is safe and effective in preventing thromboembolism in the mother during the 2nd
trimester. However, it is teratogenic and can lead to miscarriage, stillbirths, fetal anticoagulation, and fetal embryopathy if used in the 1st trimester.
Heparin is safe for the fetus as it does not cross the placenta but is less effective than warfarin in preventing thromboembolism.
LMWH- Low molecular weight heparin, UFH- Unfractionated heparin
For patients taking LMWH, factor Xa levels should be monitored weekly.
Heparin should be discontinued just before (at least 6 hours before) delivery. If delivery occurs before discontinuation and there is extensive bleeding, then iv protamine sulfate can be given.  Warfarin or heparin anticoagulation can be restarted after 6 hours of vaginal delivery, usually   without any problem.
Warfarin, LMWH, and UFH do not accumulate in breast milk and do not have an anticoagulant effect in the newborn. They are compatible with breastfeeding.

Q8,An 18-year-old girl with short stature has primary amenorrhea and has not attained puberty yet. Identify the chromosomal defect as shown in the image.,"a)Turner's syndrome
b)klinefelter's syndrome
c)kallman syndrome
d)AIS","The given karyotyping image shows a “45 Xo” abnormality, which is seen in Turner's syndrome.
clinical features of Turner's syndrome include short stature, low posterior hairline, broad chest, widely spaced nipples, coarctation of the aorta, bicuspid aortic valve, cubitus valgus, and
pigmented nevi.
Turner's syndrome is the most common sex chromosome abnormality in females. The classical  karyotype is 45, Xo. other variants have structural abnormalities of X chromosomes or mosaic patterns. some patients may present during infancy. They mainly present with oedema of the    dorsum of the hand and foot due to lymphatic stasis. The most important cause of increased
mortality in children with Turner's syndrome is cardiac abnormalities.
Turner's syndrome is a common cause of primary amenorrhea. During embryogenesis, fetal
ovaries develop normally and the absence of a second X chromosome leads to accelerated loss of   normally formed oocytes. This gets completed by the age of 2. The ovaries are reduced to atrophic fibrous bands without ova and follicles. These are called streak ovaries.



At puberty, they fail to develop secondary sexual characteristics.


other options:
option B: Eunuchoid body habitus with abnormally long legs is usually seen in klinefelter
syndrome (47, XXY). The image below shows the clinical features and karyotyping of klinefelter syndrome respectively. Note the two X and one Y chromosomes.






option C : kallman's syndrome is a hypothalamic disorder that occurs due to defective
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).
It is mainly associated with anosmia or hyposmia or hypoplasia. other associated features such as colour blindness, optic atrophy, deafness, cleft palate, renal abnormalities, and cryptorchidism
may be present.
option D : Androgen insensitivity syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder in which the
androgen receptors are absent, scanty, or fail to respond to testosterone. In complete AIs, the individual is born as a phenotypically normal female but generally presents with primary
amenorrhea.
The external genitalia appears normal, with absent or scant pubic and axillary hair. The vagina is shortened and blind-ending with an absent uterus and ovaries. These patients may also present    with a history of childhood inguinal hernias, due to the presence of undescended testis in the
abdomen or in the inguinal canal. Due to the constant conversion of testosterone into estrogen, these individuals have normal breast development.",6265-3866.PNG,A,6289-3888.PNG;6289-3887.PNG;6290-3889.PNG

Q13,"A woman at 3o weeks of gestation presents with pain and redness in the calf region. A
diagnosis of DVT is made. which of the following would you use in the management of the patient?","a)LMwH
b)warfarin
c)Fondaparinux
d)Rivaroxbaran","The pregnant woman with DVT at 30 weeks of gestation will be managed by low molecular weight heparin.
LMWH is the drug of choice in the management of DVT in any trimester of pregnancy, as it does not cross the placenta to cause fetal malformations. It has better bioavailability, longer half-life,   predictable dose response and reduced adverse effects like osteoporosis and thrombocytopenia.
LMWH is given subcutaneously twice a day for up to 3- 6 months, followed by a prophylactic dose for the remaining pregnancy and post-partum period. After the symptoms subside, graduated
compression stockings can be used for two years to reduce post-thrombotic syndromes like chronic leg paresthesia, intractable oedema and leg ulcers.
other options:
option B- Warfarin is used in the second trimester in patients with mechanical valves even though it is teratogenic, as LMWH does not provide adequate therapeutic effects and is associated with
increased maternal thromboembolic events.
option C and D- Fondaparinux and rivaroxaban are not typically used in pregnant women due to insufficient data about their safety during pregnancy. Fondaparinux is reserved for cases with
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and for those who do not tolerate heparin.",,A,
Q14,"A G2p1L1 woman with a previous history of breech delivery underwent an LSCS which was uneventful. Now, she was brought to the ER with an antepartum haemorrhage and was
shifted for LSCS during which she lost a lot of blood. An obstetric hysterectomy had to be carried out. An image of the uterus is given below. what is the diagnosis?","a)placenta previa
b)Abruptio placenta
c)placenta accreta syndrome
d)uterine rupture","The given clinical scenario of this woman with previous LSCS, bleeding per vaginum during
pregnancy with hysterectomy image showing placenta adherent to the uterine wall suggests that it is a case of placenta accreta syndrome.
placenta accreta is described as an abnormally implanted, invasive, or adhered placenta. It is due to the partial or total absence of the decidua basalis and imperfect development of the Nitabuch   layer.
Nitabuch layer is a layer of fibrin between the compact endometrium and the cytotrophoblastic shell in the placenta. This layer is absent in the placenta accreta.
There are 3 variants of placenta accreta syndrome. They are :
• placenta accreta - villi are attached to the myometrium.
• placenta increta - villi invade the myometrium.
• placenta percreta - villi penetrate through the myometrium and to or through the serosa.",6268-3869.PNG,C,6295-3893.PNG

Q17,"A P1L1 woman, with a history of uneventful previous delivery, presents with secondary
infertility and amenorrhea for 2 years. The laparoscopy performed is shown below. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Tuberculosis
b)Endometriosis
c)Multiple fibroids
d)Sarcoidosis","The clinical scenario of secondary infertility with previous uneventful delivery and the laparoscopy image showing multiple granulomatous foci which are tuberculous lesions point towards the
diagnosis of genital tuberculosis.
Genital tuberculosis is almost always secondary to a primary focus elsewhere. The most frequent location is the lungs (5o%), although it can also come from lymph nodes (4o%), kidneys, joints,  the gastrointestinal system, or as part of a broad miliary infection. It mostly spreads via the
haematogenous route or lymphatics sometimes.
In Genital tuberculosis, the leading presenting complaints include infertility, abdominal pain,
vaginal discharge, and suspicion of neoplasm. 1o-15% of women are found to be asymptomatic as well.



The fallopian tubes are the most common site to be affected. The disease subsequently spreads to other genital organs and the peritoneum.
Investigations:
1. Complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) tests - lgG and IgM, and Mantoux tests are done to evaluate the case of genital
tuberculosis. The nucleic acid amplification technique (NAAT) can detect tuberculosis within a few hours compared to culture.
2. Hysterosalpingography (HSG) - If genital tuberculosis is suspected, HSG should not be performed because of the risk of spread of infection.
If performed in an asymptomatic woman, the following patterns may be seen:
• The tobacco-pouch appearance of hydrosalpinx and pyosalpinx with blocked fimbrial end.
• Rigid non-peristaltic pipe-like tube (lead-pipe appearance).
• Beading and variation in filling defect.
• The jagged fluffiness of the tubal outline.
• Golf club appearance with slight or moderate dilatation of the ampullary portion of the fallopian tube.
3. The investigation of choice in genital tuberculosis is an endometrial biopsy. Endometrium
tissue is obtained by D&amp;C/hystroscopy-directed biopsy. The endometrial scrapings are used for histopathology, PCR testing, and AFB smear and culture.
Diagnostic laparoscopy is widely used to establish the diagnosis of genital tuberculosis/ abdominal pelvic tuberculosis. Tuberculous lesions can be seen on the parietal peritoneum, intestinal serosa,  omentum, surface of the uterus, and fallopian tubes.",6270-3871.PNG,A,
Q18,"A 45-year-old female came with complaints of spotting and foul-smelling discharge. on per speculum examination, cervical erosions were present. which of the following is the most    appropriate investigation required?","a)Liquid based cytology, cervical biospy, HpV antigen testing
b)pap smear, cervical biopsy, HcV testing
c)pap smear, cervical biopsy, HBV DNA
d)pap smear, Electrophoresis, HSV DNA","Liquid-based cytology, Cervical biopsy, and HPV antigen testing (option A) are the most
appropriate investigations required in this patient with spotting, foul discharge, and cervical erosion which are the features suggestive of cervical cancer.
In liquid-based cytology, a smeared plastic spatula is placed in the liquid fixative (methanol)
which removes blood, mucus, and inflammatory cells from epithelial cells. The epithelial cells are  then sucked into a filter and pressed onto a glass slide to form a monolayer. This is done to screen patients for cervical cancer.
Differentiating between cervical erosion/ectropion and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer is difficult on macroscopic visualization, therefore cervical biopsy is required to
rule out CIN and cervical cancer.
HPV antigen testing is required as HPV-16 is associated with anogenital warts and cervical carcinoma.
Pap/ Papanicolaou test is a screening test only. A positive test requires further evaluation - colposcopy, cervical biopsy, and fractional curettage should be done.",,A,
Q19,In the absence of other obstetric complications in twin pregnancies A and B. what is the preferred mode of delivery for A and B respectively?,"a)A. vaginal delivery B. LSCS

d)Both vaginal delivery","Image A shows 1st twin in the breech presentation and Image B shows 1st twin in the vertex  presentation, Therefore the mode of delivery for images A and B would be LScS and vaginal delivery respectively. (Option B)
Timing of delivery depends on the type of twin pregnancy:
The mode of delivery depends on the 1st twin:
After delivery of 1st twin, if the 2nd twin is in breech, assisted breech delivery is done. If the 2nd twin is in a transverse lie, the internal podalic version is done under GA in the OT followed by
breech extraction.
complications in attempting vaginal delivery in non-vertex presentation (i.e) transverse and breech:
• Interlocking of twins
• Fetal head trapping above the cervix
• umbilical cord prolapse

Q20,A P1L1 woman had delivered a baby 8 hrs before by vaginal delivery. what is the earliest time to insert an IUCD?,"a)After 3 months
b)within 48 hours
c)After 6 weeks
d)Between 48 hours - 6 weeks","The earliest time to insert an IUCD is within 48 hours.
PPIUCD (postpartum IUCD) can be inserted:
(a) post-placental (within 1o minutes of placental delivery)
(b) within 48 hours postpartum
(c) during cesarean section
(d) 4-6 weeks after postpartum.
with PPIUCD, the chances of perforation are less, and the expulsion rate is slightly high.
The timing of the insertion of IUCD is as follows:
Interval insertion (inter-conceptional period)- preferable to insert 2–3 days after menstruation, but it can be inserted at any time during the cycle. It can also be inserted during menstruation  which has certain advantages like an open cervical canal and a distended uterine cavity
It can also be inserted within 5 days of coitus as an effective method of emergency contraception (Eg: incase of ruptured condom during intercourse)",,B,
Q21,A pregnant woman presents with a history suggestive of hyperthyroidism at 8 weeks of POG. what is the drug of choice?,"a)Methimazole
b)Carbimazole
c)Propylthiouracil
d)Propranolol","The drug of choice for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis during the first trimester of pregnancy is propylthiouracil (PTU). It is because it has lower teratogenic effects than carbimazole or
methimazole.
Carbimazole and methimazole are associated with teratogenic effects such as:
• Aplasia cutis congenita



• choanal atresia
• Treacheosopageal fistula
• Fetal goiter
However, propylthiouracil use is limited to the first trimester due to the risk of hepatotoxicity. It is replaced with carbimazole or methimazole in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters ofthe pregnancy.
The lowest effective antithyroid drug dose should be used throughout gestation. This is to maintain the maternal serum-free T4 level in the upper limit of the non-pregnant normal  reference range.
propranolol is a non-selective beta blocker. It is used in thyroid storm preferentially as it blocks the peripheral conversion of inactive T4 to active form T3.",,C,
Q22,"A 42-year-old woman, p2L2, who had her last pregnancy 2o years ago, presents with heavy bleeding. A smooth, round, globular structure is observed on examination. on bimanual
examination, the uterus is described as multiparous and firm, and the cervix admits one finger. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Hypertrophied cervix
b)Myomatous polyp
c)polypoid adenocarcinoma
d)placental polyp","In the clinical scenario, the smooth, globular structure shown during examination as well as the presentation of heavy menstrual bleeding suggests the diagnosis of myomatous polyp.
Myomatous polyp, also known as a fibroid polyp, is a type of benign tumor originating from the smooth muscle cells of the uterus, called leiomyomas. These polyps can protrude from the
endometrial cavity or cervix and may appear as a smooth, pinkish, round mass, which can sometimes be seen on physical examination, especially when they extend into the vagina.
Fibroids can cause symptoms like heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), pelvic pain, and
pressure. These polyps may remain attached to the uterine wall via a stalk, which can give them a globular appearance.
since myomatous polyps are associated with fibroids, they tend to occur in women of reproductive age and may persist into the perimenopausal period, as seen in this 42-year-old patient.
other options:
option A: Hypertrophied cervix: A hypertrophied or enlarged cervix is not typically described as a smooth, globular mass. It usually does not present with a history of heavy bleeding.
option c:  polypoid adenocarcinoma mainly occurs due to malignant changes of uterine or
endometrial polyp in post-menopausal women. Endometrial polyps, another name for uterine polyps, are soft, microscopic growths that develop inside a woman's uterus, or womb. They
originate from the endometrium, the tissue that lines the uterus.

b)Malignant ovarian cyst
c)Follicular cyst
d)Hemorrhagic cyst","Transvaginal ultrasound findings of a left adnexal cystic mass, with incomplete septa and no vascular flow along with the complaints of lower abdominal pain suggest the diagnosis of
hydrosalpinx.
A hydrosalpinx is a chronic cystic swelling of the fallopian tube that forms after a distal tubal
obstruction. The cogwheel appearance and incomplete septa described in the ultrasound can
correspond to the appearance of a hydrosalpinx. The lack of vascular flow on Doppler imaging
supports this diagnosis. The tubes are enormously distended due to filling with clear serous fluid   and become retort-shaped. on histology, the tubal plicae appear flattened. The interstitial end of   the tube is open whereas the fimbrial end is indrawn and closed. This permits the dye to enter but



not exit the tube during HSG.
It is caused due to:
• pelvic inflammatory disease
• Endometriosis
• Tuberculosis - tubercular salpingitis may also cause tobacco-pouch appearance, lead pipe appearance and pyosalpinx
• Fallopian tube neoplasms (rare)
It can be an incidental finding during a pelvic exam or ultrasound. The patient may be asymptomatic, or present with infertility or chronic pelvic pain.
on HSG, it appears as terminal sacculation and occlusion of both fallopian tubes with a normal
uterine cavity. usually, a thin-walled, hypoechoic, cystic structure is seen. However, it may appear as multiple hyperechoic mural nodules around the inner circumference of the tube creating a
'beads on a string' appearance.
Treatment:
• Treat the underlying cause
• Laparoscopic salpingostomy - in mild disease
• IVF recommended for women with infertility and severe hydrosalpinx


other options:
option B: Malignant ovarian cyst: Malignant ovarian cysts can appear as complex masses with irregular shapes and internal vascularity.
option C: Follicular cyst: A follicular cyst is a common type of ovarian cyst that occurs when a follicle fails to release an egg. It typically appears as a simple cyst on ultrasound.
option D: Hemorrhagic cyst: A hemorrhagic cyst results from bleeding into a pre-existing cyst and often shows complex internal echoes and potentially some vascular flow on Doppler imaging.",6273-3874.PNG,A,6304-3900.PNG
Q25,A Woman undergoing infertility treatment is found to have bilateral tubal blockage on hysterosalpingography. what is the most appropriate next step in her management?,"a)Intrauterine insemination (IUI)
b)In vitro fertilization (IVF)
c)Laparoscopic chromopertubation
d)ovulation induction","The most appropriate next step in management for a patient with bilateral tubal blockage on hysterosalpingography is laparoscopic chromopertubation.
Tubal contractions, particularly cornual spasms, can give an incorrect impression of proximal
fallopian tube obstruction (a false-positive result) on hysterosalpingography. Laparoscopy with
chromotubation is therefore considered to confirm the diagnosis of cornual spasm. Laparoscopy is both diagnostic and therapeutic in this condition.
Laparoscopic chromopertubation involves the laparoscopic visualization of pelvic structures,
including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, followed by the injection of methylene blue dye through the cervix to assess tubal patency. In addition to evaluating tubal patency, laparoscopy
can help diagnose peritubal adhesions, endometriosis, and other pelvic abnormalities.
chromotubation may be performed, in which a dilute dye is injected through a Leech-wilkinson cannula placed against the cervix or through a balloon catheter positioned within the uterine
cavity. Tubal spill is evaluated through the laparoscope. Indigo carmine dye, if available, is
preferable to methylene blue, as methylene blue rarely may induce acute methemoglobinemia,
particularly in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. It is commonly done in the proliferative phase.
other options:
option A: Intrauterine insemination (IUI): IUI is used for treating infertility but relies on open fallopian tubes for natural fertilization.
option B: In vitro fertilization (IVF): while IVF is an effective treatment for infertility due to tubal blockage, the immediate next step to confirm and evaluate the extent of tubal blockage is typically laparoscopic chromopertubation.
option D: ovulation induction: ovulation induction aims to stimulate egg release but does not address tubal blockage.",,C,
Q26,"A primigravida experienced precipitous labor While being transported in an ambulance. Upon arrival at the hospital, the given injury is observed. what type of injury is most likely?","a)2nd degree perineal tear
b)4th degree perineal tear
c)3rd degree perineal tear
d)1st degree perineal tear","The given image shows a perineal tear extending up to the rectal mucosa, therefore, it is a grade 4 perineal tear.
The involvement of rectal mucosa as shown in the image differentiates it from grade 3 tear. Grade 3 tear involves the vaginal mucosa, perineal skin, perineal muscles, and the anal sphincter
complex (external and/or internal), but not rectal mucosa, while grade 4 tear involves all these layers including the rectal mucosa.
Minor perineal injuries are quite common, especially during the first birth. Gross injures like third or fourth degrees of perineal tears are a result of mismanagement of the second stage of labour.
This can be prevented by proper conduct of the second stage labour.
Management is as follows:



All recent tears should be repaired immediately after the delivery of the placenta. If there is a
delay of 24 hours, the repair has to be withheld and the patient has to be started on antibiotics to prevent infection. complete perineal tears that were not repaired in the first 24 hours should be   operated on between 3-6 months after delivery.
In 3 months of time, any local infection that might have been present would subside, the general    condition of the patient will also improve. However, if the perineal tear is untreated for more than 6 months, dense scar tissue forms and making the surgery difficult.",6274-3876.PNG,B,
Q27,what is the most common site for tubal ligation and the reason for ligation at this site?,"a)Ampulla; as it has more circular muscles than longitudinal muscles
b)Ampulla; as it is the widest part
c)Isthmus; as it has uniform muscle thickness
d)Isthmus; as it is the narrowest part","The most common site for tubal ligation is the isthmus of the fallopian tube due to its uniform muscle thickness, which facilitates effective occlusion.
The isthmus, being a narrow segment closest to the uterine wall, provides an ideal location for
surgical intervention. This site ensures a more reliable and efficient ligation, minimizing the risk  of complications and maximizing the success rate of the procedure. The uniformity of the muscle layer at this location allows for a consistent occlusion technique. common procedures for tubal
ligation at this site include the pomeroy method, where a loop of the tube is tied and excised, and other techniques like the Falope ring or the electrocoagulation method.
while the ampulla, which has a larger-diameter segment lateral to the isthmus, is also a part of the fallopian tube, it is less frequently chosen for tubal ligation. Additionally, ligation at the
isthmus allows for the possibility of future reversal, should the patient desire to conceive again, making it a favourable choice for women considering sterilization.
The fallopian tube consists of three layers: the mesosalpinx, an outer mesothelial layer serving as visceral peritoneum; the myosalpinx, which has an inner circular smooth muscle layer for
pressure during contractions and an outer longitudinal layer for tube movement; and the
endosalpinx, an inner columnar epithelium with ciliated and secretory cells, featuring longitudinal folds. Together, these layers transport the ovum efficiently toward the uterine cavity.
Note: The interstitial portion of the fallopian tube is the narrowest segment, located within the uterine wall, and it forms the tubal ostia that opens into the endometrial cavity.",,C,
Q28,"A 3o-year-old female, P2L2, presents with a mass per vaginum. on examination, infravaginal elongation of the cervix is noted. How will you treat this condition?","a)Mccall culdoplasty
b)Le Forte's surgery
c)Fothergill surgery
d)Latzko procedure","The appropriate treatment for a 3o-year-old female with infravaginal elongation of the cervix is Fothergill surgery.
Fothergill surgery, or the Manchester operation, involves performing an anterior colporrhaphy
combined with the amputation of the cervix. During the procedure, the Mackenrodt ligaments are sutured in front of the cervix, and the operation concludes with a colpoperineorrhaphy. This
surgical approach is particularly suitable for women under 4o years old who wish to maintain
reproductive function, although it’s important to note that fertility may be reduced following the procedure.
various other surgeries were performed for the management of uterovaginal prolapse:



• Anterior colporrhaphy: This is done for cystocele or cystourethrocele.
• posterior colporrhaphy/ colpoperineorrhaphy: This is done for posterior defects like rectocele or rectal defects with perineal laxity.
• Le Forte's repair(option B): This is preferred only in elderly women with advanced prolapse, or those unfit for surgery. women wanting an active sexual life are poor candidates for this
procedure as it creates an adhesive area in the midline.
• Abdominal sling surgeries: young women desirous of retaining menstrual and reproductive
functions are ideal candidates. These surgeries use tapes as slings to prevent organ descent. These include:
• Abdominal wall cervicopexy (modified by purandare and Mathre) - sling attached to cervix posteriorly near uterosacral ligaments.
• shirodkar's sling surgery - the sling fixes the cervix to the lumbosacral fascia.
• khanna's sling surgery - sling fixed to the anterior superior iliac spine, strengthening the Mackenrodt's ligament.
• Fothergill surgery (Manchester operation)
• ward-Mayo surgery: This is a combination of vaginal hysterectomy + pelvic floor repair. It is done in women &gt;4o years, not desiring reproductive function.
• Moschowitz surgery: This is performed for enterocele repair where the pouch of Douglas is obliterated.
Management of vault prolapse:
• If the patient is fit for abdominal surgery: Transabdominal sacral colpopexy, i.e., suspending the vault to the sacral promontory extraperitoneally. It is best suited for younger women since coital   difficulty following vaginal surgery is avoided
• If the patient is not fit for abdominal surgery: Right Transvaginal sacrospinous colpopexy. It is usually preferred in obese and elderly women, who are not fit for abdominal surgery.
• colpocleisis is permissible if sexual activity is not desired.
other options:
option A: Mccall culdoplasty is primarily used to prevent enterocele formation and provide support to the posterior vaginal apex, particularly following vaginal hysterectomy.
option D: The Latzko procedure is a surgical technique used to treat vesicovaginal fistula. It involves removing the vaginal epithelium around the fistula and approximating the edges to promote healing.",,C,
Q29,"A 28-year-old P2L2 woman presents with complaints of a mass descending through the

b)Ischial Tuberosity
c)Ischial spines
d)sacral Promontory","In abdominal sling procedures such as sacral colpopexy, which is used to treat pelvic organ
prolapse while preserving fertility, the mesh is typically attached to the sacral promontory. This site provides strong support for the prolapsed vaginal apex and allows for a durable suspension without significant compromise to the patient's fertility.

Q30,"A woman who had a mediolateral episiotomy during normal labor presents with pain at the episiotomy site, which worsens during her menstrual periods. The findings noted on
episiotomy site exploration are shown in the image below. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Retained Suture
b)Melanoma
c)Inclusion cyst
d)Endometriosis","This patient presenting with symptoms of cyclical pain at the episiotomy site with image showing  perineal scar endometriosis has ectopic endometrial tissue. Endometriosis can occur at the site of a surgical scar and typically presents with cyclical pain that corresponds with the menstrual cycle.
The extra-uterine sites of endometrial tissue are influenced by cyclical changes in the hormone levels which give rise to location-specific symptoms as mentioned above.
Management:



Investigations include:
• USG: TVS will show a chocolate cyst.
• MRI
• CA-125 more than 35 U/mL
• Laparoscopy: Gold standard for the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis. It is used to locate the sites, take a biopsy and surgically remove the deposits.
Drugs used for symptom control include the following:
• oral contraceptive pills
• Mirena IUD
• GnRH analogs
• Letrozole
Surgical management includes:
Minimally invasive surgery may be used to destroy the tissue by cautery, laser vaporization, and lyse adhesions that have formed as a complication of endometriosis.
Major surgical measures include incision of chocolate cyst and removal of lining,
salpingo-oophorectomy, hysterectomy, and unilateral or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
other options:
option A: Retained Sutures: Retained sutures can cause localized pain and inflammation, but this is usually accompanied by visible signs of infection or irritation rather than cyclical pain linked to menstruation.
option B: Melanoma: Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that would usually present as a
suspicious, irregularly shaped lesion rather than cyclical pain at the site of a previous surgical scar.

• Recurrent pregnancy loss
• preterm labor
• Malpresentations
• prematurity

d)Terminate the pregnancy because of high risk of infection","The most appropriate course of action in this patient at 1o weeks intrauterine gestation is to Remove the IUCD immediately and continue pregnancy.
Intrauterine Devices in pregnancy
• If IUD strings are visible and  the pregnancy is less than 13 weeks, the IUD should be removed as soon as possible to prevent later septic abortion, premature rupture of the membranes, and    premature birth .



• when the strings of the IUD are not visible, an ultrasound examination should be performed to localize the IUD and determine whether expulsion has occurred. If the IUD is present, there are   three options for management:
• Therapeutic abortion .
• Ultrasound-guided intrauterine removal of the IUD.
• continuation of the pregnancy with the device left in place Note :
If the patient wishes to continue the pregnancy, ultrasound evaluation of the location of the IUD should be considered .
• If the IUD is not in a fundal location, ultrasound-guided removal using small alligator forceps may be successful.
• If the location is fundal, the IUD should be left in place. when pregnancy continues with an IUD in place, the patient must be warned of the symptoms of intrauterine infection and should be
cautioned to seek care promptly for fever or flulike symptoms, abdominal cramping, or bleeding. At the earliest sign of infection, high-dose intravenous antibiotic therapy should be given and the pregnancy evacuated promptly.",,C,

Q36,"A woman presents with chronic lower abdominal pain that worsens during menstruation.
ultrasound reveals a right adnexal mass with homogeneous echoes. MRI shows a 4x5 cm T1 hyperintense lesion without fat suppression, while the T2 sequence demonstrates low signal intensity with characteristic dark shading. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)cystic tumor of ovary
b)Dermoid cyst
c)Endometrioma
d)Teratoma","The most likely diagnosis is endometrioma. The patient's chronic lower abdominal pain, which worsens during menstruation, and the ultrasound finding of a right adnexal mass with
homogeneous echoes are highly suggestive of an endometrioma.
Endometriosis is defined by the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue at a site outside of the
uterus. It is a benign condition but it is locally invasive. some common sites of endometriosis are ovaries, pelvic peritoneum, pouch of Douglas, uterosacral ligaments, rectovaginal septum, and
sigmoid colon. Endometriosis in the ovaries is called endometrioma.
Chocolate cysts of the ovaries represent the most important manifestation of endometriosis.
patients with endometriosis mainly present with progressively increasing secondary
dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, infertility, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain.
MRI is the diagnostic tool, it shows the characteristic hyperintensity on T1 weighted images and hypointensity on T2 weighted images. Laparoscopy confirms the diagnosis.
Medical management of endometriosis:
• Gestrinone is an anti-estrogenic, anti-progestational, and mildly anabolic drug that reduces sex hormone-binding globulin to release free testosterone. It also decreases the LH surge. It causes    regression of lesions and amenorrhea. It is a 19-nortestosterone derivative similar to danazol but with fewer side effects.
• Combined oral contraceptives are used for symptom control and alleviating disease. These also cause menstrual cycle regulation and delay pregnancy.
• oral progestogens exert an anti-estrogenic effect and cause decidualization and endometrial atrophy. This causes disease regression. It doesn't prevent ovulation, thus suitable for
women trying to conceive.
• Mirena IUCDs reduce dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia. It is a single-sitting treatment with minimal side effects.
• Aromatase inhibitors like letrozole are anti-estrogens given for disease regression.
• Anti-inflammatory drugs like mefenamic acid and naproxen relieve dysmenorrhea. Therapeutic procedures:
• Aspiration of peritoneal fluid from the cul-de-sac removes pGE2, relieves dysmenorrhea, and pelvic pain, and improves fertility.
• Destruction of endometriotic lesions &lt;3cm with diathermy, Nd-YAG laser, or Co2 vaporization can be attempted.
• Larger lesions and chocolate cysts can be excised.
• Laparoscopic breaking of adhesions relieves dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain. It also restores tubal patency and improves ovulation. pre-sacral neurectomy can be done
simultaneously.



• Laser uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA) is done for pelvic pain.

Q37,A woman’s vaginal sample shows an abnormal Nugent's score. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Bacterial vaginosis
b)Herpes Infection
c)Trichomoniasis
d)candida Albicans","The most likely diagnosis is bacterial vaginosis.
Nugent's criteria are used to evaluate three types of bacteria in a case of suspected bacterial
vaginosis: Mobiluncus, Lactobacillus, and Gardnerella/Bacteroides. Bacteria are graded through the gram stain of vaginal samples.
They are each graded on a scale of 1+ to 4+ where:
• 1+ is &lt; 1 cell per field



• 2+ is 1-5 cells per field
• 3+ is 6-3o cells per field
• 4+ is &gt;3o cells per field
Lactobacillus and Bacteroides/Gardnerella are given scores between o-4, but Mobiluncus is graded only from o-2. The total scores are then calculated and interpreted as follows:
• o-3 - Normal
• 4-6 - Intermediate bacterial count
• 7-1o - Bacterial vaginosis",,A,
Q38,"After ovulation, in which phase is the released egg arrested?","a)primary oocyte with meiosis I completed
b)secondary oocyte arrested in meiosis II
c)primary oocyte arrested in meiosis I
d)secondary oocyte with meiosis II completed","After ovulation, the released egg is arrested in meiosis II.
The released egg is in the secondary oocyte stage, having completed meiosis I. It then enters    meiosis II, but this process is arrested at metaphase II until fertilization occurs. If fertilization takes place, meiosis II will be completed; otherwise, the secondary oocyte remains arrested in  meiosis II.
oogenesis is the process wherein oogonia differentiate into mature oocytes. It begins before birth. At birth, there are approximately 2 million primordial follicles. primordial germ cells divide by
mitosis to form oogonia.
The majority of the oogonia divide by mitosis, however, some enter meiosis I and get arrested in the diplotene stage of prophase and are now called primary oocytes. These primary oocytes
remain arrested in this manner until puberty. primary oocytes haven't completed meiosis, hence they're diploid. The primary oocyte along with surrounding epithelial cells forms the primordial  follicle.
Meiosis I is completed after LH surge during puberty to form the secondary oocyte. The cell then enters meiosis II but arrests in metaphase approximately 3 hours before ovulation.
If fertilization does not occur, the secondary oocyte fails to complete the second meiotic division and degenerates about 24 hours after ovulation. If fertilization occurs, penetration by the
sperm signals the secondary oocyte to complete meiosis II. This results in one mature oocyte (ovum) and another smaller cell called the second polar body that is shed off.",,B,6316-3904.PNG
Q39,"A 45-year-old woman presented with menorrhagia. A hysterectomy was performed, and the specimen is shown below. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Intramural Fibroid
b)Myomatous polyp
c)Endometrioma
d)Adenomyoma","The given clinical scenario as well as the specimen suggests that this is a case of leiomyoma uteri or fibroid uterus. The specimen is of a leiomyoma.
Gross specimen appearance:
• The uterine body/corpus is enlarged and deformed.
• The cut surface shows multiple nodules, well-circumscribed, firm, and white-greyish with a
whorled appearance formed by the intersecting bundles of brown muscle fibres and white fibrous tissue.
• Leiomyomas can also present bleeding areas, cystic degeneration, and calcifications. The uterine cavity is compressed.
• A typical myoma is a well-circumscribed tumor with a pseudo capsule and firm inconsistency. The cut surface has a whorled appearance.
• The vessels that supply blood to the tumor lie in the capsule and send radial branches into the tumor.
• Therefore, the central portion of the tumour receives the least blood supply and degeneration is noticeable early in this part of the tumour.
• on the other hand, calcification begins at the periphery and spreads inwards along the vessels.
Risk factors:
Increased risk of leiomyomas is seen in nulliparous women, those with obesity, and individuals in a hyper-estrogenic state, such as in conditions like endometriosis, endometrial hyperplasia, or
endometrial carcinoma. Black women are also at higher risk.
conversely, the risk is decreased in multiparous women. Recent studies have shown no significant correlation between smoking and the development of leiomyomas.



Symptoms of fibroid uterus:
Most women with leiomyomas are asymptomatic, but those affected may experience bleeding,
pain, pressure, or infertility. Symptom risk increases with the size and number of myomas. Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is common, linked to dilated endometrial venules and dysregulated
vasoactive growth factors. when these engorged venules are disrupted during menstruation, bleeding can overwhelm normal hemostatic mechanisms, causing HMB.
Treatment:
Medical therapy for fibroids includes mifepristone, GnRh analogs, Aromatase inhibitors Drugs to reduce the size of the fibroid
• Antiprogesterone – Mifepristone/Ru-486
• Danazol (usually not used due to androgenic side effects)
• GnRH analogs
• Agonists – goserelin, leuprorelin, nafarelin, buserelin
• Antagonists – cetrorelix, ganirelix
• Levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system
• Selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM’s) – Asoprisnil

d)Serous cystadenoma of ovary","The most likely diagnosis is endometrioid carcinoma. It is the most common type of endometrial cancer, particularly associated with genetic mutations such as PTEN, KRAS, CTNNB1
(beta-catenin), and MSI (microsatellite instability). These genetic alterations are characteristic of Type I endometrial cancers, which have a better prognosis compared to other types.
The histopathological examination (HPE) shows glandular structures that resemble normal endometrial glands but are more crowded and irregular. The cells show nuclear atypia with  mitotic activity.



This cancer is generally hormone-dependent (Type I endometrial cancer) and often carries a better prognosis compared to other forms of endometrial cancer. The presence of PTEN and KRAS mutations are indicators ofthis type of malignancy, which often grows slowly and is    diagnosed early due to the symptoms of postmenopausal bleeding.
Endometrial cancer occurs in a state of estrogen excess and is therefore mostly seen in:
• nulliparous women
• early menarche
• late menopause
• PCoS
• HRT
• estrogen-producing tumors
• Hypertension, diabetes, and obesity (adipose tissue produces estrogen E1) together form the corpus cancer syndrome.
Endometrial biopsy is the investigation of choice and if positive should be followed by     hysteroscopy with fractional curettage (gold standard) for assessing grade and histology.
other options:
option A: Mixed Müllerian Tumor: Also known as carcinosarcoma, this tumor shows both
epithelial and mesenchymal components. It is less commonly associated with the mutations listed (PTEN, KRAS, etc.) and typically presents with more aggressive features than endometrioid
carcinoma.
option B: Leiomyosarcoma: This is a malignant tumor of smooth muscle, typically arising from the myometrium, and is not associated with genetic mutations (PTEN, KRAS, CTNNB1).
option D: Serous Cystadenoma of ovary: A benign ovarian tumor, this condition would not
typically involve the genetic markers found in endometrial carcinoma and would present
differently from endometrial cancer. Serous tumors of the ovary are more often associated with TP53 mutations, not PTEN or KRAS.",,C,
Q41,"A 21-year-old woman at 1o weeks of gestation, comes to you for medical termination of pregnancy. which method would you prefer for this patient?","a)Dinoprostone
b)Mifepristone and Misoprostol
c)oxytocin infusion
d)Intrauterine instillation of hyper-osmotic saline","Misoprostol and mifepristone are administered during first trimester to induce medical
termination of pregnancy.
2oomg of mifepristone is administered orally on day 1. The minimum recommended interval
between mifepristone &amp; misoprostol is 24 hours. 24- 48 hours later, misoprostol 8oo mcg is administered by the vaginal, sublingual, or buccal route. Clinical confirmation of MTP is done on day 14.
The various methods of termination of pregnancy are:
Misoprostol and Methotrexate regimen can also be used, but take a longer time of action.
The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Amendment Bill, 2o2o has extended the period of
termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks for special categories of women, including survivors



of rape, victims of incest, and other vulnerable women (like differently-abled women, minors). The upper gestation limit is not applicable in cases of substantial fetal abnormalities.

Q42,what is the time taken for the embryo to travel from point 1 to 8?,"a)2 days
b)8 days
c)5 days
d)14 days","The embryo takes approximately 8 days to travel from point 1 (fertilization) to point 8
(implantation) (typically 6-7 days).
Timeline of implantation:
• 3-4 days after fertilization: The morula (12-16 cells) enters the uterus.
• 4th day after fertilization: The advanced morula reaches the uterine lumen.
• 4-5 days after fertilization: The early blastocyst stage is seen.
• 6-7 days after fertilization: The blastocyst implants in the uterus. Implantation corresponds to 2o-22 days of the menstrual cycle.
The blastocyst normally implants in the functional layer of the uterine endometrium. In the
secretory phase, the endometrium comprises three layers: stratum compactum, stratum
spongiosum, and stratum basale. The first two layers, collectively known as the stratum
functionale or functional layer, are crucial for implantation. If implantation does not occur, this  functional layer is shed off during menstruation. However, if implantation occurs, the functional layer is retained as the decidua, marking the beginning of a successful pregnancy.",6280-3881.PNG,B,6320-3906.PNG;6320-3905.PNG
Q43,"A 28-year-old woman, G4P3L3, with 1 neonatal death (NND) and 2 previous lower segment     cesarean sections (LSCS), presents at term with an active genital herpes infection. what is the preferred mode of delivery?","a)Elective LSCS
b)Classical Cesarean section
c)Trial of labor (VBAC)
d)Induction of labor","For women with active genital herpes at the time of labor, elective cesarean section is the
preferred mode of delivery to prevent neonatal herpes transmission. A standard lower segment
cesarean section (LSCS) is typically performed unless there are other complications necessitating a different approach.
HSV infection in pregnancy can be caused by either HSV-1 or HSV-2 and transmitted by sexual contact. The infection can be primary, nonprimary, first episode, and recurrent.
HSV infection (both HSV 1 and 2) during pregnancy has a risk of vertical transmission of the infection to the fetus. The risk is higher in the primary than in the recurrent infection. The
maximum risk of fetal infection is during labor, although it can occur in utero and post-natally from direct contact.



suspicious lesions should be sent for PCR testing or culture. Antiviral treatment with acyclovir   should be given if found positive. women with no active genital lesions, asymptomatic, or those with active lesions in non-genital areas can undergo normal labor and delivery.
Management of HsV infection during pregnancy:
• oral acyclovir or valacyclovir for primary or recurrent infections during pregnancy.
• IV acyclovir followed by oral acyclovir for severe or disseminated infection
• oral analgesics or topical anesthetics for pain relief
• Catheterization for urinary retention
Cesarean delivery reduces the risk of vertical transmission during labor and is indicated in:
• Cases of active genital lesions - both primary and recurrent
• Prodromal symptoms like vulval itching or burning
other options:
option B: Classical Cesarean section: Classical cesarean section involves a vertical incision on the upper part of the uterus and is generally reserved for specific cases such as abnormal uterine
anatomy or placenta previa
option C and D: Trial of Labor (VBAC) and Induction of Labor: Vaginal birth after cesarean
(VBAC) and induction of labor are contraindicated in women with active genital herpes due to the risk of transmitting the virus to the newborn during vaginal delivery.",,A,

Q45,Identify the forceps typically used for delivering the aftercoming head in a breech delivery:,"a)wrigley's forceps
b)kielland's forceps
c)Das's forceps
d)piper's forceps","The image shows piper's forceps, identified by its distinct perineal curve. It is used to assist in the delivery of the after-coming head of breech.
It has a cephalic curve, reverse pelvic curve, and long parallel shanks that permit the baby’s body to rest against it during head delivery. It may be applied electively or when the Mauriceau
maneuver cannot be accomplished easily.
other options:
option A: wrigley forceps: These are short forceps generally used for low or outlet deliveries but are not suitable for delivering the after-coming head in breech deliveries.
option B: kielland forceps: These are rotational forceps used to assist in malpositioned heads during cephalic deliveries.
option C: Das forceps: These forceps are used for cephalic deliveries.",6282-3882.PNG,D,
