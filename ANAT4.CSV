b) Adduction and lateral rotation
c) Abduction and medial rotation
d) Extension and lateral rotation","The area marked in the given image is the gluteal tuberosity. The muscle that is inserted here is the gluteus maximus which causes extension and lateral rotation of the hip joint.
Gluteus maximus inserts onto iliotibial tract (3/4th part) and deep fibers (1/4th) attach on gluteal tuberosity (marked in image). It is supplied by the inferior gluteal nerve.

b) Dopamine
c) Glutamine
d) Noradrenaline","The area marked in the given image is substantia nigra (meaning- dark substance). The neurotransmitter secreted by this area is dopamine.

• Tuberoinfundibular",96-92.PNG,B,109-107.PNG
Q4,which of the following arteries passes in close proximity to the area marked by the arrow in the given image?,"a) Internal carotid artery
b) Middle meningeal artery
c) Anterior cerebral artery
d) Deep temporal artery","The area marked by an arrow in the given image is pterion and the artery that passes in close proximity to this area is the middle meningeal artery.
The pterion is an H shaped sutural junction between four bones of the skull:
• Frontal bone
• squamous part of the temporal bone
• Greater wing of the sphenoid bone
• parietal bone.
It is an important structure as it overlies the anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery and lateral fissure of the cerebral hemisphere. The bone in this area is thin and any injury to this area may lead to rupture of the middle meningeal artery leading to extradural hematoma.",97-94.PNG,B,110-108.PNG
Q5,where are the Ito cells in the liver located?,"a) space of disse
b) space of moll
c) sinusoids
d) Bile canaliculi","Ito cells/Hepatic stellate cells are located in the space of Disse. They are mesenchymal in origin. The space of Disse or the perisinusoidal space (or space of Disse) is a location in the liver between hepatocytes and the liver sinusoid.
significance of Ito cells:
Ito cells are in a dormant state for the majority of the duration. They store the fat-soluble vitamin A in their lipid droplets and are a signi¦cant source of growth factors involved in liver homeostasis and regeneration.
when there is liver injury, Ito cells get activated. They replace damaged hepatocytes with collagenous scar tissue and secrete intralobular matrix components, including collagen type III (reticular) ¦bres. This leads to hepatic ¦brosis.
Note: A narrow space which separates limiting plate (a sleeve of modified hepatocytes) from the connective tissue of the portal area is known as space of moll.",,A,111-109.PNG
Q6,which of the following features differentiates the exocrine pancreas from the parotid gland?,"a) Basal lamina lining the serous acini
b) Absence of striated duct
c) presence of serous acini with acidophilic tip
d) presence of apical acinar villi","Absence of striated duct in exocrine pancreas differentiates it from the parotid gland.
The exocrine pancreas is comprised entirely of serous acini. Hence, its general structure is similar to that of the parotid gland, but the two are easily distinguished by:
• The parotid gland has striated and intercalated intralobular ducts, whereas the pancreas has only the intercalated type.
• The excretory ducts of the parotid gland are striated columnar, whereas the excretory duct of the pancreas is a simple columnar.",,B,
Q7,Medial lemniscus is a continuation of which of the following structures?,"a) spinothalamic tract
b) spinocerebellar tract
c) spinotectal tract
d) Fasciculus gracilis","Medial lemniscus is a continuation of fasciculus gracilis.
posterior column–medial lemniscal pathway:
First-order axons carrying discriminative touch and vibration sensations enter the dorsal horn and continue traveling upward in the posterior white column as the fasciculus gracilis and fasciculus cuneatus.
Fibers of these fasciculi synapse on the second-order neurons of the ipsilateral nuclei gracilis and cuneatus in the medulla oblongata, respectively.
Axons of these second-order neurons then cross over as the internal arcuate fibers to form the medial lemniscus in the contralateral medulla.
These second-order axons ascend through the brainstem to reach the third-order neuronal cell bodies in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus. Axons from the third-order neurons then project through the posterior limb of the internal capsule to reach the primary somatosensory cortex.",,D,112-110.PNG
Q8,The type of fibers present in the fornix are:,"a) Association and commisural fibers
b) Association and projection fibers
c) commissural and projection fibers
d) Association fibers","The fibers present in the fornix are association fibers except for the hippocampal commissure of fornix which has commissural fibers. Hence the most appropriate answer is option A. i.e both association and commissural fibers.
Association fibers connect various cortical regions within the same hemisphere whereas commissural fibers connect corresponding regions of two hemispheres.

The structures marked in the image are:
A. Right vagus nerve
B. Left vagus nerve

D. Right phrenic nerve
paradoxical movements in the chest are as follows:
• paradoxical respiration - the abnormal movement of the chest wall or abdominal wall, where they move in during inspiration instead of moving out. It is seen in flail chest.
• paradoxical movement of the diaphragm - normally, the diaphragm moves down during inspiration. However, in cases of phrenic nerve palsy, the affected side of the diaphragm moves upward (paradoxical respiration) due to diaphragmatic paralysis. The gold standard investigation to detect this is the electrical or magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerve with a recording of the compound muscle action potential and/or the transdiaphragmatic pressure. This can be observed on ultrasound or fluoroscopy.",99-95.PNG,D,114-111.PNG

Reticular fibres are fine, anastomosing fibres composed of mainly type III collagen. They differ from type I collagen fibres in that, they are finer and are arranged in the form of a network (reticulum). The fibres appear black in colour on staining with silver impregnation. Due to this affinity to silver salts, they are also known as argentophil fibres.

Glenohumeral abduction is about 12o° or more. The glenohumeral arthrodesis restricts the abduction at about 45° . Further abduction occurs at the sterno and acromioclavicular articulations, and contralateral vertebral flexion.
Muscles involved in the abduction of the shoulder:
• The first 15° of abduction is initiated by the supraspinatus muscle.
• 15° to 9o° of abduction is carried out mainly by the middle fibers of the deltoid muscle.
• Abduction of the arm, beyond 9o°, is carried out by the movement of the shoulder girdle caused by the action of trapezius and serratus anterior.",,D,

b) primary cartilaginous
c) secondary cartilaginous
d) Fibrous joint","The middle radioulnar joint is an example of a fibrous joint (syndesmosis).
The radius and ulna are united with each other by three joints:
• proximal (superior) radioulnar joint
• Middle radioulnar joint
• Distal (inferior) radioulnar joint
proximal and distal radioulnar joints are uniaxial pivot joints (synovial) and are involved in pronation and supination movements of the forearm.
The middle radioulnar joint is a fibrous joint (syndesmosis). The radius and ulna, in the middle, are connected by two syndesmoses namely:
• The oblique cord - extends from the lateral side of the ulnar tuberosity to the radius, distal to the radial tuberosity.
• Interosseous membrane - a broad, thin collagenous structure, which runs perpendicular to the oblique cord. It extends distomedially between the interosseous borders of the radius and ulna.
Based on the structure, joints are classified into three types:
• Fibrous joints (sutures, syndesmosis, Gomphosis)
• cartilaginous joints (primary cartilaginous joints or synchondrosis, secondary cartilaginous joints or symphysis)
• synovial joints (Ball-and-socket or spheroidal joints, sellar or saddle joints, condylar or bicondylar joints, Ellipsoid joints, Hinge joints, pivot or trochoid joints, plane joints)",,D,122-120.PNG

option D: In cross-section at the level of T4-T5, where, the arch of the aorta begins and ends, bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk is visible.",105-102.PNG,C,125-124.PNG
Q24,A Patient is unable to abduct his arm. which of the following root values is likely to be affected?,"a) C4
b) C5
c) C6
d) C7","The inability to abduct the arm is most likely due to a lesion of the C5 root.
The deltoid muscle is the main muscle involved in the abduction of the arm. It is innervated by the C5 root of the axillary nerve. So, a lesion involving the C5 causes inability to abduct the arm.
