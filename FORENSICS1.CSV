Q3,A person was brought dead and an autopsy was performed to find the cause of death. The following findings were noted on examination. what is the probable cause of death?,"a)Throttling
b)strangulation
c)Hanging
d)Mugging","The given autposy images are suggestive of throttling.







In throttling, the following mechanisms may lead to death:
• occlusion of blood supply to the blood to the brain - carotid arteries
• occlusion of the airway - minor role
• carotid sinus pressure may result in vagus nerve stimulation resulting in cardiac arrest (vasovagal shock)
other signs in deaths due to asphyxia:
• petechial hemorrhages in the face, eyebrows, eyelids, forehead, ears, conjunctiva, sclera
• when they occur in the visceral pleura, they are called Tardieu’s spots
• congested larynx with slight oozing
• Marked venous congestion of internal organs
• Emphysematous, congested  lungs with serosanguinous fluid exudates in alveoli
• Dark-coloured blood due to accumulation of co2
option B: strangulation is a very generalised term used to describe deaths due to violent asphyxia. Eg- ligature strangulation, throttling etc
option c:  In the case of hanging, there will be a ligature mark, injury to the cervical spine etc.
option D: In case of mugging the neck is compressed or squeezed by holding it between the crook of the elbow or knee. The attack is usually made from behind. Though a victim killed by this
method shows signs of asphyxia and other struggle marks, the examination neck will not show  any evidence of violence, as the compression was affected by the soft muscles of the arm or leg.",2666-1630.PNG,A,2671-1632.PNG;2671-1631.PNG;2672-1633.PNG

Q5,A 14-year-old rape victim presents with 26 weeks of pregnancy. what should not be done?,"a)A female doctor should examine the patient
b)vaginal swab examination is not necessary
c)No need to confirm pregnancy by UPT
d)Termination of pregnancy with her consent by a Gynaecologist","According to the MTp Act 2o21 amendments, pregnancy beyond 24 weeks of gestation cannot be terminated. Also, the guardian's written consent is required in the case of a minor girl.
• Up to 2o weeks of pregnancy, any qualified practitioner can perform an abortion. However, he must have undergone compulsory training.
• Between 2o-24 weeks of pregnancy, the opinion of a second practitioner must be obtained to justify performing the abortion.
• The woman to be wanting an abortion should be above 18 years of age to consent. If not, consent can be obtained from the parents or guardian when she is a minor or mentally unsound.
In the cases of sexual assault of a female child, a female doctor is appointed for the examination (option A). In case, such a doctor is unavailable, then the head of the institution can nominate a woman for that purpose. These examinations are carried out in the presence of a parent or
guardian.
vaginal swab samples are typically collected within 96 hours (ideally up to 72 hours), as the chances of detecting evidence decrease significantly after this period. (option B)",,D,

Q7,"In a case of a gun shot injury to skull with entry wound at left temporal region surrounded by abrasion collar &amp; tattooing and a exit wound at right temporal region along with metal     fragments of bullet inside the bullet track. which of the following should be preserved to
determine the range of firing ?","a)Hair
b)Bullet pieces
c)Blood
d)clothes","The main objective of the study of a firearm wound (Ballistics) is to establish the range and direction of the firing. The ultimate purpose is to determine the weapon used for firing.
Firearm wounds are of two fundamental types: wounds of entry and wound of exit.
The wound of entry is the wound through which the bullet or pellets enter the body, and the wound of exit is the wound through which the bullet emerges out of the body.
To determine the Range of firing, the following parameters are used:
• Entry wound size and shape
• Blast effect – Muzzle end imprint and edge eversion
• Blackening, Tattooing, singeing of hair, Abrasion collar, and Grease collar.
In the above options, Hair should be preserved in order to determine the range of firing which can be examined for carbonization/desiccation in close range, also from lead deposition around the
wound to assess the range of firing.

Q8,order of appearance of rigor mortis:,"a)orbicularis oculi, facial muscles, thorax, upper limb
b)orbicularis oculi, neck, facial muscles, upper limb, thorax
c)Neck, muscles of eyelid, upper limb, thorax
d)Neck, muscles of eyelid, facial muscles, thorax, upper limb","The correct order is orbicularis oculi, facial muscles, thorax, and upper limb.
Nysten's rule describes the sequential onset of rigor mortis in various muscle groups.
Rigor mortis begins from the head and progresses down the body:
• The order of appearance of rigor mortis is heart (left chamber) → eyelids → muscles of the neck → lower jaw → muscles of the face → muscles of the chest(thorax) → upper
limb → abdomen → lower limb → fingers and toes (proximo-distal progression)
It disappears in the same order of appearance.
Note that in option B, the upper limb is mentioned before thorax and hence is not the answer.",,A,
Q9,Black foot is seen in which poisoning,"a)Arsenic
b)Lead
c)Mercury
d)phosphorus","Blackfoot's disease  is a form of arsenic induced peripheral vascular disease resulting in gangrene.
• Arsenic is a heavy metallic inorganic irritant poison. Metallic arsenic is not poisonous as it is insoluble in water and cannot be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. However arsenious  oxide or arsenic trioxide (sankhyal or somalkar) is poisonous.
• They are found in shell fish, cod, and haddock.
• Arsenic compounds act by inactivating the sulfhydril enzymes, which in turn interfere with the cellular metabolism, in the liver, lungs, intestinal wall, and spleen. Arsenic can replace
phosphorus in the bones where it may remain for years. It also gets deposited in the hairs.
• chronic poisoning with arsenic presents with a sequence of five different set of manifestations.
• Gastrointestinal : The victim presents with gradual weight loss, malnutrition, fatigue, loss of appetite, cirrhosis of liver, nausea, vomiting, etc.
• catarrhal changes :  The victim presents with running nose, headache, conjunctivitis, bronchial catarrh, etc.
• Raindrop pigmentation : It is known to produce milk and roses complexion initially, followed by patchy brown pigmentation of the skin (especially face), which resembles the raindrops. It might   also show hyperkeratosis of the skin of the palm and soles (Black Foot), which is prone to change  into basal cell carcinoma at a later stage. The scalp may also show alopecia (baldness).
• Meese’s lines : The victim’s nail manifests with whitish lines 1 to 2 mm breadth across the nail of the finger and toes representing the deposition of the poison as a result of high sulphhydril
content of the keratin.
• Arsenical neuritis : The victim presents with polyneuritis, optic neuritis, anesthesias, paresthesias, atrophy of extensors resulting in wrist and foot drop, etc.",,A,
Q10,criminal responsibility of Insane is defined in:,"a)McNaughten’s Rule
b)currens Rule
c)Durham’s Rule
d)American Law Institute Test","• McNaughten’s Rule was formed by the Judges of McNaughten’s case, to clarify the common law of insanity in England during 1843. It is similar to IPc 84/ BNS 22 which states “Nothing is an
offence which is done by a person who at the time of doing it by reason of unsoundness of mind is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to   law”.
• This forms the basis of the 6test’ of insanity that the jury should be instructed to apply in each case of alleged insanity.
• The rules are:
• Every man is presumed to be sane and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction.
• To establish an insanity defence, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of  the act, the accused was laboring under 6such a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know   he was doing what was wrong’.
• currenls rule of 1964 states that an accused person is not criminally responsible, if at the time of commiting the act, he did not have the capacity to regulate his conduct to the requirements of the  law, as a result of mental disease or defect.
• Durham ls rule of 1954 States that an accused person is not criminally responsible if his unlawful act is the product of mental disease or mental defect.",,A,
Q11,An autopsy was performed to find the cause of death of a person brought dead to the casualty and it showed a fracture of the thyroid cartilage and bruising around the neck. The cause of    death is?,"a)Hanging
b)Throttling
c)strangulation
d)Mugging","Both bruising around the neck and the fracture of the thyroid cartilage are findings seen in
throttling. Throttling/manual strangulation is when bare hands are used to compress the neck and strangulate.
Mechanism of death:
• occlusion of blood vessels supplying blood to the brain (carotid arteries).
• occlusion to airway probably plays a minor role if any, in causing death
• carotid sinus pressure may result in vagus nerve stimulation, resulting in cardiac arrest (vagal inhibition)
Autopsy findings:
• Bruising of neck: due to the grasping of the neck by the assailant.
• Abrasions on the neck: fingernail marks from assailant or victim
• Fracture of thyroid cartilage
• Inward fracture of greater cornu of the hyoid bone.",,B,
Q12,"A 3o-year-old drowsy male was brought to the casualty. His pulse was 13o/min, respiratory rate -3o/min. His lab reports are given below. He showed improvement on nasogastric
aspiration and administration of sodium bicarbonate, calcium gluconate, and 4-methyl pyrazole. what substance did he most likely consume?","a)Formaldehyde
b)Ethylene glycol
c)paraldehyde
d)Methyl alcohol","The given scenario point towards ethylene glycol poisoning.
Ethylene glycol is converted to glyoxyaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. Glyoxyaldehyde causes kidney damage.
Methanol is converted to formaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. Formaldehyde causes retinal damage like blurring of vision/loss of vision.
The principles of treatment for both these conditions are the same. It predominantly involves using fomipezole or ethanol to inhibit the metabolic conversion of these relatively non-toxic    alcohols to their toxic metabolites.",,B,
Q13,which of the following is false regarding teeth features and ethnicity?,"a)In Africanoids the cusps of molars are wide and deep and shovel shaped cusps in incisors
b)caucasians have carabelli cusps
c)upper third molar is most commonly absent in Mongolians
d)prominent lingual ridge and labial ridge in mongols","The cusps of molars are wide and deep and cusps of incisors are shovel-shaped in Mongoloid races.
Africanoid races tend to have large teeth and often have more cusps on their molars, even up to     eight, with two lingual cusps on the mandibular first premolars as an additional common finding.
In caucasian races, the lateral incisors in the upper jaw are usually smaller than the central. They also have long pointed canine roots. small nodules on the lingual surface of maxillary molars,
called carabelli’s cusp are most common in caucasian races.
In mongoloid teeth, enamel pearls and small nodules of enamel on the tooth surface, are much
more frequent. The condition of bull-tooth or taurodontism is most common in Mongoloid
people. The pulp cavity of molars is wide and deep, and the roots are fused and bent. A congenital lack of the third upper molar is most commonly seen. The lingual and labial ridges are more
prominent.",,A,
Q14,Jack knife position causes death due to:,"a)wedging
b)Burking
c)positional asphyxia
d)Traumatic asphyxia","Jack-knife position leads to positional asphyxia.
It is a position where the victim's thighs and knees are driven against the chest causing indirect compression ofthe chest and restriction of breathing movements.",,C,
