Q1,All of the following are indications of surgery in a patient of potts' spine except?,"a)cold abscess without neurological complication
b)Doubtful diagnosis
c)Drug resistant TB
d)progressive cauda equina syndrome/conus medullaris syndrome","A cold abscess without neurological complications is not an indication for surgery in pott’s spine/TB spine.
Indications of surgery in TB spine are:
• progressive neurologic deficit such as progressive cauda equina syndrome/conus medullaris syndrome (option D)
• progressive increase in spinal deformity
• Resistance to anti-tubercular therapy (option C)
• Recurrence of disease
• Cord compression
• severe pain due to abscess or spinal instability
• progressive impairment of pulmonary function
• uncertain diagnosis (option B): Inability to obtain a microbiological diagnosis through
microscopy, culture, or pCR techniques may occur. In cases where there is no accessible source  for sampling (such as discharging sinus or superficial abscess) or insufficient specimen obtained from image-guided percutaneous biopsy, an open surgical biopsy is the only option to obtain a    specific culture and sensitivity report.
Antero-lateral decompression is the surgery of choice for pott’s paraplegia as it helps in the removal of both solid and liquid debris.",,A,
Q2,"In case of a meniscal tear repair, which of the following zones heals best?","a)Red zone
b)white zone
c)Gray zone
d)Red+white zone","The red zone heals best in case of a meniscal tear due to its rich blood supply.
The menisci are divided into three zones depending on the perfusion of blood. The menisci are    supplied by perimeniscal blood vessels from superior and inferior branches of medial and lateral genicular vessels.
Following birth, the menisci become increasingly avascular. By adulthood, only the peripheral 1o% to 25% of the tissue is perfused. This gives rise to 3 distinct regions of the menisci:



• The peripheral relatively vascularised region called the red-red zone (zone 1)
• A zone of transition between the 2 zones, which is called the red-white zone (zone 2)
• The completely avascular inner zone known as the white-white zone (zone 3)
There is a direct relationship between the vascularization and capacity of the tissue to heal, predisposing the white-white zone to permanent post-traumatic and degenerative lesions.",,A,5284-3333.PNG
Q3,A 22-year-old male patient presents with a history of RTA. His leg is in abduction and external rotation. what could be the cause?,"a)Anterior dislocation of the hip
b)posterior dislocation of the hip
c)Intertrochanteric fracture
d)Fracture neck of femur","The patient presents with abduction and external rotation of the lower limb following a road traffic accident, which is suggestive of anterior dislocation of the hip.
Anterior dislocation of the hip is usually sustained following a high-energy accident. on physical examination, the affected limb will show abduction, external rotation, and slight flexion.
Lengthening of the limb is observed, along with a prominent anterior bulge in either the pubic or groin region.
In posterior dislocation of the hip, the lower limb is flexed, adducted, and internally rotated, and   this condition is associated with limb shortening. The neck of femur fracture and intertrochanteric fracture present with external rotation and shortening of the lower limb.
The given image shows a patient with an externally rotated, abducted, and slightly flexed left leg due to anterior dislocation of the hip:





According to the position assumed by the femoral head, anterior dislocation of the hip can further be classified as:
• Type I - superior or pubic
• Type II - Inferior or obturator
A lateral view X-ray will be confirmatory. Radiological findings include:
• The displaced femoral head will appear larger than the normal side
• As the thigh is externally rotated lesser trochanter is more prominent
X-RAY showing anterior dislocation of the hip:


Treatment of anterior dislocation includes a closed reduction under sedation or general anesthesia. If closed reduction fails, an open procedure may be planned.",,A,5285-3335.PNG;5285-3334.PNG
Q4,The most specific test for carpal tunnel syndrome is?,"a)Durkan's test
b)phalen test
c)Tinel test
d)Two point discrimination","Among the given options, Durkan's test is the most specific test for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).
CTS is a common entrapment mononeuropathy caused by median nerve compression as it passes  through the fibro-osseous carpal tunnel beneath the flexor retinaculum. patients present with pain and paresthesia over the radial 3 and a half digits. There may be a weakness of thumb opposition. In chronic cases, the thenar eminence is wasted. The diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds but nerve conduction studies can confirm the diagnosis.
Durkan's test is the most specific test for the diagnosis of CTS. In Durkan's test, direct median nerve compression for about 3o seconds, elicits paresthesias and pain.
other tests for CTS:
• phalen's test - Elicited by holding the wrist flexed fully. The appearance of sensory symptoms within 6o seconds implies a positive test.


• Tinel's test - Sensory symptoms reproduced by percussing over the median nerve imply a positive test.
Two-point discrimination is done to assess sensory loss and is not specific to carpal tunnel syndrome.",,A,5286-3336.PNG
Q5,"A female patient with a history of fall few months back presents with the deformity shown in the image. probing into history reveals it was managed with traditional treatment. This
deformity is likely to be due to ____________","a)Intra-articular fracture of wrist
b)Extra-articular fracture of wrist
c)Boxer's fracture
d)Barton's fracture","The given image shows the dinner-fork deformity seen in Colle's fracture which is an
extra-articular fracture of the wrist.
Colle's fracture is a fracture of corticocancellous junction of the distal end of the radius. The
dinner fork deformity is the prominence on the back of the wrist and depression in the front. It is due to the dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment. It is treated by a Colles’ cast, which     immobilizes the wrist in palmar flexion, pronation, and ulnar deviation.



Displacements that may be seen in colles' fracture:
• Dorsal tilt
• Dorsal shift
• Lateral tilt (Radial tilt)
• Lateral shift (Radial shift)
• supination
• Impaction of fragments
The given radiograph shows the dorsal tilt of the distal fragment leading to dinner fork deformity.",5278-3329.PNG,B,5287-3337.PNG
Q6,scoliosis screening in school children is done by?,"a)straight leg raising test
b)Forward bending test
c)Backward bending test
d)single leg standing test","The forward bending test is used as a screening tool in scoliosis.
Adam's forward bending test is the best clinical test for evaluating spinal curvature in scoliosis. steps of Adam's test :
• The patient is asked to bend forward at the waist until the spine is at the horizontal level
• knees must be maintained straight, with the feet together, the arms dependent, and the palms in opposition
• The examiner observes the trunk from behind (to assess midthoracic and lumbar rotation) and from the front (to assess upper thoracic rotation)
It is used to differentiate between structural and non-structural curves in scoliosis. on bending forward, non-structural scoliosis disappears, while structural scoliosis persists.





A straight leg raising test is used to find nerve compression in the lumbosacral area.",,B,5288-3338.PNG
Q7,Fishtail deformity is seen in the fracture of_____________,"a)Distal end of radius
b)Distal end of humerus
c)Distal end of tibia
d)Distal end of femur","Fishtail deformity is seen following a fracture of the distal end of the humerus.
Fishtail deformity of the elbow is a rare complication that can occur in childhood after a distal  humeral fracture. It is characterized by a contour abnormality of the distal humerus due to the absence or resorption of the lateral trochlear ossification centers.
Fishtail deformity of the distal humerus can be of 2 types:
• The first type is a sharp-angled wedge, which commonly occurs after fractures of the lateral
condyle. It is caused by the persistence of a gap between the lateral condylar physis ossification center and the medial ossification of the trochlea. Because of this gap, the lateral crista of the     trochlea may be underdeveloped, which may represent a small “bony bar” in the distal humeral physis
• The second type is believed to be associated with osteonecrosis of the lateral part of the medial crista of the trochlea.",,B,
Q8,Ring sequestrum is seen in?,"a)TB osteomyelitis
b)pin tract infection
c)chronic osteomyelitis","Ring sequestrum is seen in a pin tract infection.
sequestrum is a fragment of dead bone lying within a cavity formed by necrosis. Infection at a pin site in an external fixation construct leads to a ring sequestrum.
Types of sequestra:



Type	seen in
Tubular	pyogenic infections like osteo myelitis
Ring	Around pin tracts in external fixators
Black	Actinomycosis
corallifor m	perthes disease
coke	Tuberculosis (cancellous bon e)
Feathery	syphilis, Tuberculosis
sandy	Tuberculosis",,C,
Q9,A counterforce brace is used in?,"a)Tennis elbow
b)Ankle sprain
c)ulnar claw hand
d)Foot drop","A counterforce brace is used in tennis elbow.
Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis, is a condition involving the lateral epicondyle caused by repetitive contraction of the extensor muscles during activities that require forceful     wrist extension and supination, such as playing tennis or using a screwdriver.
A counterforce brace is a treatment option for tennis elbow (shown in the image below). It works by applying compression to the extensor muscles, specifically the extensor carpi radialis brevis
(EcRB) region, which helps release the forces exerted on the lateral epicondyle. This compression prevents the transmission of tension up to the lateral epicondyle, providing relief and promoting   healing in the affected area.
Management options in tennis elbow:
• conservative management: Rest and physiotherapy
• Medical intervention: Injection of local anesthetic and steroids
• surgical methods: percutaneous release of epicondylar muscles
• other management methods: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy, arthroscopic release,
autologous blood injections, counterforce bracing, rehabilitative exercises, and ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle therapy.",,A,5290-3339.PNG
Q10,"A 1o-year-old boy presents with pain around the left knee joint. on X-ray, there is a lesion at the distal femur extending up to the terminal end. The gross image of the condition is given   below. what can be the most probable diagnosis?","a)Giant cell tumour
b)chondroblastoma
c)osteoid osteoma
d)osteosarcoma","The given clinical scenario, involving a child and a gross specimen revealing a metaphyseal tumor in the distal femur that has infiltrated through the cortex, lifted the periosteum, and extended
through the epiphyseal plate, supports the diagnosis of osteosarcoma.
A giant cell tumor (option A) is primarily an epiphyseal tumor that usually affects adults between  ages 2o and 4o years when skeletal maturity is complete. chondroblastoma (option B) is a benign tumor of childhood most commonly seen in the epiphysis. osteoid osteoma (option c) is a benign tumor most commonly seen in the diaphysis ofthe proximal femur.
osteosarcoma is the most common non-hematologic primary malignancy of bone. It occurs most commonly in the second decade of life. It is typically metaphyseal. The distal femur, proximal
tibia, and proximal humerus are common sites.
Morphologically, osteosarcomas are bulky, gritty, gray-white tumors, often with hemorrhage and cystic degeneration. They destroy cortices, form soft tissue masses, and spread extensively in the medullary canal, replacing hematopoietic marrow. Although infrequent, they may also penetrate  the epiphyseal plate or enter the joint.
Radiological features:
• Irregular destruction in the metaphysis overshadowed by the formation of new bone
• Lifting of the periosteum (codman triangle) due to the formation of new bone inciting a periosteal reaction
• Bone formation along the blood vessels within the tumor centrifugally, giving rise to a sunburst (sunray) appearance",5280-3330.PNG,D,5291-3340.PNG
Q11,which of the following substances is used for bone formation in a patient with non-union?,"a)PMMA
b)BMP
c)ca Po4
d)caso4","Among the given options, bone morphogenic protein (BMP) is the substance used for bone formation in a patient with non-union.
BMP is a bone-stimulating protein used as a bone graft in the treatment of non-union and open tibial fractures.
Bone grafts can be:
• osteoinductive: They stimulate osteogenesis through the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoprogenitor cells. BMPs are osteoinductive.
• osteoconductive: They provide linkage across defects and a scaffold upon which new bone can   form. Calcium phosphate (option C), calcium hydroxyapatite, and calcium sulfate (option D) are osteoconductive.
Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), also known as bone cement, holds bone and metal implants together by forming an interlocking network between the irregularities.",,B,
Q12,The brace shown in the given image is _____.,"a)Boston brace
b)Milwaukee brace
c)Taylor brace
d)ASHE brace","The brace shown in the image is the Milwaukee brace.
The Milwaukee brace is an active corrective spinal orthosis primarily used in the ambulatory
treatment of structural scoliosis. Designed as a cervico-thoracic-lumbar-sacral orthosis (CTLSo),  the main objective of the Milwaukee brace is to delay or eliminate the need for surgery. However, in recent years, the use of the Milwaukee brace has declined due to the availability and
convenience of modern braces. Nonetheless, it is still employed for scoliosis cases characterized by high thoracic and cervical spine curves.





option A: Boston brace is a type of thoraco-lumbo-sacral-orthosis (TLSo brace). It has a hard polypropylene outer shell with a soft foam lining inside. It is used in patients whose scoliosis  curve apex is at T7 or lower. The below image shows a Boston brace.


option C: Taylor brace is designed to control the upper and lower regions of the spinal column and support your spine whilst standing, sitting, and walking after spinal surgery.





option D: ASHE brace (Anterior spinal hyperextension brace) is used in dorso lumbar spinal injury.",5281-3332.PNG,B,5292-3342.PNG;5292-3341.PNG;5293-3343.PNG
Q13,"A 4o-year-old man is suffering from increasing difficulty in bending forward with increasing stiffness of the spine and reduced chest movements. A CT was performed and shown below, the likely diagnosis is?","a)Ankylosing spondylitis
b)Rheumatoid arthritis
c)Reiter's syndrome
d)Fluorosis","The given clinical scenario of a 4o-year-old man with increasing stiffness in the spine, along with CT spine showing ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament and ankylosis involving the     thoracolumbar vertebral bodies points to a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
AS is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the spine and sacroiliac joint. It is more common in young males and has a strong association with HLA-B27.
Features of lower back pain in AS:
• Age at onset &lt; 4o years
• Insidious onset
• Morning stiffness &gt; 3o minutes
• Improvement with exercise
• pain persists with rest and is also present at night.
• Alternating gluteal pain
• persistence for more than 3 months
Examination findings in AS:
• Loss of lumbar lordosis
• Increased thoracic kyphosis
• Diminished spinal movements
• Decreased chest expansion ( &lt;7 cm)



• Tenderness over sacroiliac joints
Important X-ray features of ankylosing spondylitis:
• sacro-iliac joints:
• Cardinal sign/earliest sign is the erosion and fuzziness of the sacroiliac joints
• Later- periarticular sclerosis and bony ankylosis of the joint.
• vertebral changes:
• Early spondylitis is characterized by small erosions at the corners of vertebral bodies with reactive sclerosis: Romanus lesions of the spine (shiny corner sign)
• squaring of vertebral bodies or flattening of the normal anterior concavity of the spine due to inflammatory resorption of the bone.
• Later signs are ossification of the ligaments around the intervertebral discs producing syndesmophytes (bridges) between adjacent vertebrae
• Bamboo spine appearance is due to bridging at several vertebral levels
• Linear ossification along the central spine, representing interspinous ligament ossification can give a Dagger sign appearance on frontal radiographs.
CT imaging in As helps to visualize bone erosions, osteoporosis/osteosclerosis, and new bone formation in the form of syndesmophytes, ligamentous ossification, and ankylosis.
The X-ray below shows the bamboo spine appearance in As:",5281-3331.PNG,A,5294-3344.PNG;5294-3344-1.png;5296-3346.PNG
Q14,"In spine fusion surgery, the screws are fixed to which part of the vertebra?","a)spinous process
b)Lamina
c)pedicle
d)Facet joint","In spine fusion surgeries, screws are placed in the pedicle of the vertebrae.
Spinal fusion or spondylodesis is a surgical technique that joins two or more vertebrae. This procedure prevents any movement between the fused vertebrae.
pedicle screws are placed above and below the vertebrae that are to be fused. These are used in a spinal fusion to add extra support and strength to the fusion while it heals.
Rods are used to connect the screws as shown below. These prevent movement and allow the bone to heal.


The post-operative X-ray given below shows fusion of L5 and S1 vertebrae.",,C,
Q15,which of the following tests are not commonly used in osteoporosis:,"a)1, 2 &amp; 3
b)2 &amp; 4
c)2 &amp; 3
d)1, 3, 4 &amp; 5","Among the given options, bone scan and quantitative CT are not commonly used in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.
osteoporosis is a common metabolic bone disease characterised by a diffuse reduction in bone density due to a decrease in bone mass.
DEXA, chemical tests and X-ray are commonly used in the diagnosis of osteoporosis. while
quantitative CT also helps to measure bone mass density at the spine and hip, it is rarely used
clinically because the radiation exposure and cost are both much higher than with DXA. A bone    scan uses a radioactive tracer injected into the bloodstream to detect altered metabolic activity in the bone with the aid of a gamma camera. It is not used in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.
DEXA - dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, is the investigation of choice for the diagnosis of  osteoporosis. T-score less than or equal to 2.5 in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip indicates osteoporosis.
Chemical tests like serum calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase levels are usually normal in primary osteoporosis and help to rule out other conditions before establishing a diagnosis of
osteoporosis.
X-ray features of osteoporosis:
• Loss of vertical height of a vertebra occurs due to collapse
• Cod fish appearance characterized by the disc bulging into the adjacent vertebral bodies, resulting in a biconvex shape
• Ground glass appearance of the bones",,C,
