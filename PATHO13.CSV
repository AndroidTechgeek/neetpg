Q1,which of the following disorders is caused due to abnormal folding of proteins?,"a)cirrhosis
b)creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
c)Nephritic syndrome
d)sickle cell anemia","creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is caused due to abnormal folding of proteins.
creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (cJD) is a prion disease that causes higher cortical function deficits.  This infection can be acquired by corneal transplantation, contaminated electroencephalogram (EEG) electrode implantation, dura mater grafts, and contaminated human growth hormone     (hGH) preparations.



symptoms are almost always rapidly progressive, and the clinical presentation includes the following:
• Myoclonus
• Higher cortical deficits
• psychiatric manifestations - depression, psychosis, and visual hallucinations
• profound dementia - memory loss, impaired judgment, intellectual decline
• visual impairment or cerebellar gait and coordination deficits in a few patients
• Nonspecific prodromal symptoms - fatigue, sleep disturbance, weight, loss, headache, anxiety, vertigo, malaise, and ill-defined pain
• Extrapyramidal dysfunction - rigidity, masklike facies, choreoathetoid movements;
• seizures
• Hypoesthesia
• supranuclear gaze palsy, optic atrophy
patients commonly present with myoclonus and dementia. EEG shows characteristic periodic electrical bursts. MRI shows increased intensity in the basal ganglia and cortical
ribboning (ribbon-like signal hyperintensity of cerebral cortical gyri). on light microscopy, the pathologic hallmarks of CJD are spongiform degeneration and astrocytic gliosis.


other options:
option C: Nephritic syndrome classically presents with tea- or cola-colored urine (hematuria), edema, hypertension, and oliguria.
Conditions which present as glomerulonephritis:
• postinfectious glomerulonephritis
• IgA nephropathy (option D)
• Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis



• Henoch-schönlein purpura (HsP) nephritis
• systemic lupus erythematosus (sLE) nephritis
• Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
• Goodpasture syndrome (option C)
• Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUs)
option D: sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder that occurs due to the point
mutation in the β-globin gene, which results in the replacement of glutamate residue with valine. This causes the production of sickle-shaped red blood cells due to the polymerization
of deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hbs). Factors that predispose to sickling are infection, dehydration, and acidosis. Clinical features are moderately severe hemolytic anemia with jaundice and painful   bone crisis. The aplastic crisis stems from the infection of red cell progenitors by parvovirus B19,   which causes a transient cessation of erythropoiesis and a sudden worsening of the anemia. In
children, splenic sequestration crises occur which results in splenomegaly due to red pulp congestion.",,B,2233-1467.PNG
Q2,"A 65-year-old male patient with chronic fatigue and lymphadenopathy presents to the
outpatient department. His peripheral smear shows the presence of smudge cells. which of the following additional investigations will you do to arrive at a diagnosis?","a)polymerase chain reaction
b)Fluorescent in situ hybridization
c)Flow cytometry
d)cytogenetics","An elderly patient with chronic fatigue and lymphadenopathy, and a peripheral smear showing the presence of smudge cells suggest a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Immunophenotyping using flow cytometry is the investigation done to arrive at the diagnosis. The classical immunophenotypic feature of CLL is CD 19+, CD2o+, CD 23+, CD5+.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is a peripheral B-cell neoplasm usually affecting adults, more commonly men. Patients are often asymptomatic at diagnosis. when symptomatic, it
presents non specifically with easy fatigability, weight loss, and anorexia. Generalized
lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are present in most symptomatic patients.
The chromosomal defects in CLL include:
• Deletion of 13q (commonest and has a good prognosis)
• Deletion of 11q
• Trisomy 12q
• Deletion of 17p (poor prognosis)
The peripheral blood smear in cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) contains small round lymphocytes having condensed chromatin and scant cytoplasm. some of these cells may get
disrupted while preparing the smears, producing smudge cells. An absolute lymphocyte count of    &gt;5ooo/mm3 is required for diagnosis. Hypogammaglobulinemia is commonly seen, making the patient susceptible to infections. A few patients may develop hemolytic anemia or
thrombocytopenia due to autoantibodies made by non-neoplastic B cells.
on lymph node biopsy: Lymph nodes are composed of small lymphocytes admixed with larger     activated lymphocytes. The large lymphocytes contain mitotically active cells and gather in loose aggregates referred to as proliferation centers. These proliferation centers are pathognomic to
CLL when present.



Expectant management is the treatment of choice for asymptomatic patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The gold standard for therapy is a combination
of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab.
Richter’s syndrome is a complication of cLL in which there is a transformation to an aggressive lymphoma, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBcL).
The image shows small round lymphocytes and smudge cells seen in cLL.",,C,2152-1408.PNG
Q3,which of the following statements is true about blood products?,"a)platelets is stored between 2o°c to 24°c with a shelf life of 5 days.
b)cryoprecipitate is stored at -2o°c with a shelf life of 6 months
c)packed red cells stored with adenine, glucose, mannitol and saline is stored between -5°c to
d)Fresh frozen plasma is stored between -5°c to -15°c with a shelf life of 2 years","The statement that is true about blood products is platelets can be stored between 2o°c to 24°c with a shelf life of 5 days.
platelet concentrates can be stored for up to 5 days at +2o°c to +24°c, with agitation. It is used in thrombocytopenia, platelet function defects, disseminated intravascular coagulation, during
massive blood transfusion to prevent dilutional thrombocytopenia, and in bone marrow
failure. Agitation during storage is necessary to maintain their viability and function. This is
because platelets are stored at room temperature, where they continue to metabolize glucose and produce lactate. Agitation helps to maintain a uniform distribution of platelets, prevent their
clumping together, and facilitate gas exchange.
Fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate are generally stored at a temperature of –3o °c. They are thawed at temperatures between +3o °c and +37 °c in the blood bank before issue and
transported to the ward at ambient temperature. They must be used immediately and should never be refrozen.
whole blood and packed red cells are always stored at +2 °c to +6 °c and transported between +2 °c and +1o °c. packed red cells stored with SAGM (sodium, adenine, glucose, and mannitol as
components) provide a shelf-life of up to 42 days.",,A,
Q4,"A patient with lytic lesions on the skull is suspected of a diagnosis of Langerhan cell
histiocytosis. which of the following is a characteristic finding on electron microscopy?","a)Histiocytes
b)Birbeck granules
c)Eosinophils
d)Giant cells","The presence of Birbeck granules in the cytoplasm is a characteristic finding of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) on electron microscopy.
Birbeck granules have a dilated terminal end producing a tennis racket–like appearance.
It contains the protein langerin (CD207). It is seen on electron microscopy.
The image below shows Birbeck granules on electron microscopy seen in LCH.


Histopathologically, Langerhans cells have a single large nucleus with a characteristic folded or
grooved nucleus (coffee-bean appearance) with small inconspicuous nucleoli. Birbeck granules are seen in the cytoplasm. The tumor cells specifically express HLA-DR, S-100, and CD1a and
langerin (CD207) markers.
The image below shows histopathological image of Langerhan cells with folded nuclei.




Langerhans cell histiocytosis occurs due to the proliferation of a special type of immature
dendritic cells, called Langerhans cells. Their normal function is to present antigens. The most common mutation is BRAFV6OOE gain-of-function mutation.
It is characterized by single or multiple osteolytic bone lesions and can also infiltrate nearly every organ, like the skin (of the scalp), lungs, liver, spleen, bone marrow, or the central nervous
system.
LCH can present as the following clinical entities:
• Multifocal multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis (Letterer-siwe disease)
• unifocal and multifocal unisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis (eosinophilic granuloma)- The combination of bone defects, diabetes insipidus, and exophthalmos is called the
Hand-schüller-Christian triad.
• pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis

Q5,Identify the mode of inheritance from the pedigree chart given below.,"a)Autosomal dominant
b)Autosomal recessive
c)pseudodominant inheritance
d)Incomplete penetrance","The pedigree chart shows an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.
Autosomal dominant conditions are manifested in the heterozygous state, hence at least one
parent of an index case is usually affected. In this mode of inheritance, both males and females     are affected and both can transmit the condition. when an affected person marries an unaffected one, every child has one in two chance of having the disease.",2219-1460.PNG,A,Picture11.png

d)1-c, 2-b, 3-a, 4-d","The correct match is:
Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant progressive brain disorder that
causes uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and loss of thinking ability. It occurs due to atrophy, with loss of neurons and gliosis in the caudate lobe, putamen, and globus pallidus. There is an abnormal expansion of the trinucleotide CAG in the Huntington gene on chromosome 4.
Trisomy 18 results in Edward’s syndrome in which a complete extra copy of chromosome 18 is
inherited as a result of meiotic nondisjunction. The clinical features include micrognathia, low-set ears, prominent occiput, and rocker bottom feet. patients have significant hypertonia including
clenched hands with overlapping fingers. Cardiac anomalies (ventricular septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus) and gastrointestinal anomalies (Meckel’s diverticulum, malrotations) are
common. prenatal ultrasound reveals fetal growth restriction.

Q7,Most specific indicator of alcohol-induced liver dysfunction is _____,"a)Serum bilirubin
b)GGT
c)SGOT
d)SGPT","Among the given options, the most specific indicator of alcohol-induced liver dysfunction is gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT).
GGT is commonly used in patients with alcoholic liver disease as a marker of excessive alcohol intake. GGT is present in many tissues, including the kidneys, pancreas, and liver. It is
mainly derived from the liver and this is often used as a marker of hepatobiliary diseases. chronic alcohol consumption leads to the induction of hepatic microsomal GGT which leads to a rise in
GGT  in alcoholics.
Laboratory investigations in patients with alcohol-induced liver dysfunction:
• AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGpT) elevations that do not exceed 4oo IU/L.
• AST/ALT ratio of &gt;1.5.
• Serum bilirubin &gt;3 mg/dL.
Note that while GGT is a sensitive marker for alcohol-induced liver disease, it is not completely specific to this condition. Other conditions such as biliary obstruction or use of certain
medications can also elevate GGT levels.",,B,
Q8,Most common cause of adrenal incidentaloma is_________,"a)Subclinical cushing's syndrome
b)Aldosterone producing adenoma
c)Pheochromocytoma
d)Non-functioning adenoma","The most common cause of adrenal incidentaloma is non-functioning adenoma
Incidentalomas are evaluated to classify them as:
• Non-functional: most common
• Functional: may present with cushing's syndrome, pheochromocytoma, aldosteronoma, cortisol-producing adenoma, etc.
• secondary metastasis: from the breast, lung, and kidneys are seen in 2% of the patients.
For patients without a confirmed diagnosis, it is recommended to conduct specific tests to identify underlying hormonally active tumors. These tests include:
(a) performing a low-dose (1 mg) overnight dexamethasone suppression test to exclude subclinical cushing's syndrome.
(b) collecting a 24-hour urine sample to measure levels of catecholamines, metanephrines, or
VMA, or measuring plasma metanephrine levels to rule out the presence of a pheochromocytoma.
(c) In hypertensive patients, conducting tests for serum electrolytes, plasma aldosterone, and plasma renin to exclude the presence of an aldosteronoma.
Management of incidentalomas:
• Non-functional: Tumors with a size &lt;4cm are managed conservatively. MRI surveillance is done every 3-6 months. For size &gt;4cm, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is done.
•
Functional tumors: Hormonal assay studies are done in suspected functional tumors or patients presenting with symptoms. If positive, it should be managed accordingly. If not managed,
functional tumors can become malignant and the incidence increases 4-fold if the size of the lesion crosses 4 cm.
•
secondary metastasis: Fine-needle aspiration and biopsy is performed. Tests for
pheochromocytoma should always be done before this procedure to avoid precipitating a hypertensive crisis.
other options:
option A: patients with incidentaloma may present with subclinical cushing’s syndrome. This
condition is identified by subtle indications of excessive cortisol, including weight gain, thinning    of the skin, facial rounding, diabetes, and high blood pressure. These symptoms are accompanied by the absence of the typical daily variation in cortisol secretion, autonomous cortisol production, and insensitivity to suppression by dexamethasone. Although the total amount of cortisol
produced and the levels of cortisol in 24-hour urine samples may appear normal, other clinical signs and hormone irregularities indicate cortisol excess.
option B: Aldosterone-producing adenomas originate in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal
glands. These tumors are typically 1o to 2o mm in diameter when initially detected, and they have



a distinct appearance—well-defined and exhibiting a golden yellow color upon slicing, often referred to as the ""canary tumor.""
The most commonly observed mutations occur in the KCNJ5 gene, which encodes the potassium   channel. These mutations are believed to cause an influx of calcium into glomerulosa cells, leading to increased secretion of aldosterone and cellular proliferation. These tumors are more frequently  found in females and are associated with larger tumor sizes and higher levels of aldosterone.
However, they are not linked to adrenal hyperplasia.
option C: pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are catecholamine-producing tumors. The     dominant clinical feature in pheochromocytoma is hypertension. Most patients have paroxysmal episodes, which are abrupt elevations in blood pressure. They are accompanied
by tachycardia, palpitations, headache, and sweating. Lab diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is based on the demonstration of increased urinary excretion of free catecholamines and their    metabolites such as VMA.",,D,
Q9,A patient on long term hemodialysis due to renal failure is likely to develop which type of amyloidosis?,"a)Amyloid light chain (AL)
b)Amyloid A (AA)
c)Amyloid β2 microglobulin (Aβ2M)
d)Amyloid transthyretin (ATTR)","patients on long-term hemodialysis for renal failure can develop amyloidosis as a result of the deposition of β2-microglobulin.
β2-microglobulin is a component of the MHC class I molecule and a normal serum protein. In the past, it was retained in the circulation of patients with chronic kidney disease because it could not
be filtered through dialysis membranes. In these patients, it would get deposited in the joints,
muscles, tendons, and ligaments. one of the complications which can occur as a result is carpal   tunnel syndrome. However, with the advent of new dialysis filters, this complication has become uncommon now.",,C,
Q10,Given below is an electron microscopy image of a cell. Identify the cell.,"a)Target cell
b)Hairy cell
c)Gaucher cell
d)sickle cell","The given electron microscopic image shows a hairy cell.
Hairy cell leukemia is so-called because of the appearance of the leukemic cells, which have fine hair-like projections that are best recognized under the phase-contrast microscope.
Hairy cell leukemia is a distinctive B cell neoplasm, that predominantly affects middle-aged males. The markers expressed in hairy cell leukemia include the usual B-cell markers- CD-19 and 20,
and specific markers such as CD 11c, CD 25, CD103, and annexin A1.
on peripheral blood smear, hairy cells have round or reniform nuclei and moderate amounts of
pale blue cytoplasm with thread or bleb-like extension. In the bone marrow, these cells are usually trapped in a mesh of reticulin fibers and so it is difficult to aspirate and hence termed a dry tap.
patients commonly present with massive splenomegaly due to infiltration of the leukemic
cells. pancytopenia due to marrow involvement can also be seen. There can be atypical
monocytopenia due to which these patients experience an increased incidence of atypical
mycobacterial infections. These tumors respond well to chemotherapy and BRAF (B-type Raf proto-oncogene) inhibitors and they have an excellent prognosis.



The classic hairy cells can be seen in the slide is shown below:


other options:
option A: Target cells have a centrally located disk of hemoglobin surrounded by an area of pallor. There is an outer rim of hemoglobin adjacent to the cell membrane giving the cell the appearance  of a target. Conditions in which target cells appear are thalassemia, hepatic disease with jaundice,  hemoglobin C disorders, and postsplenectomy state.
option C: Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder with a deficiency
of acid-β-glucosidase. It has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. It leads to the
accumulation of glucosylceramide in the reticuloendothelial system. The features of this disease include growth retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and Erlenmeyer    flask deformity of the distal femur. Histology shows the presence of Gaucher cells, a
characteristic wrinkled-paper appearance resulting from the presence of intracytoplasmic substrate inclusions. The intelligence of the child is normal.




option D: sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder that occurs due to the point
mutation in the β-globin gene, which results in the replacement of glutamate residue with valine. This causes the production of sickle-shaped red blood cells due to the polymerization
of deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hbs).",2221-1461.PNG,B,2242-1470.PNG;2242-1469.PNG;2243-1471.PNG
Q11,which of the following statements is true regarding the immunological abnormality that is seen with the lack of CD4o in B cells is?,"a)Total lack of natural killer cells
b)Lack of CD8 mediated cytotoxicity
c)Decrease in IgG and increase in IgM
d)Inability of neutrophils to fight against infections","The deficiency of the CD4o and its absence in B cells leads to Hyper IgM syndrome. A decrease in IgG and an increase in IgM is seen in this syndrome.
The patients most often have loss-of-function mutations involving either CD4o or
activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a DNA-editing enzyme expressed in B cells that are required for Ig class switching and affinity maturation.
The deficiency of the CD4o and its absence in B cells interferes with class switching and the
production of memory cells. The B-cell response to antigens, is unaffected, accounting for the   presence of increased IgM antibodies. Hence, the condition is known as Hyper IgM syndrome.
The serum of the patients has normal or elevated levels of IgM but no IgA or IgE and extremely low levels of IgG. Clinical features are recurrent pyogenic infections because of low levels
of opsonizing IgG antibodies. They are highly susceptible to pneumonia caused by pneumocystis jirovecii.",,C,

Q14,which of the following are the true statements about amyloidosis?,"a)2,3,4
b)1,3,4
c)1,2,3
d)1,2,4","The true statements about amyloidosis are:
• It is an extracellular protein.
• It is called amyloid because of starch deposition.
• Beta-pleated sheets are seen on X-ray crystallography.
Amyloidosis refers to extracellular deposits of fibrillar proteins.
Abnormal fibrils are produced by the aggregation of misfolded proteins. The fibrillar deposits
bind a wide variety of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, including heparan sulfate and
dermatan sulfate, and plasma proteins, notably the serum amyloid P component (SAP). Amyloid appears as an amorphous, eosinophilic, hyaline, extracellular substance.
The adsorbed proteins contain abundant charged sugar groups that give the deposits
staining characteristics that resemble starch. Hence, these deposits were called amyloid.
It could be classified as systemic, localized, or hereditary amyloidosis. Microscopically, all types of amyloid deposits are made up of continuous, nonbranching fibrils. A characteristic
cross-β-pleated sheet conformation is visualized on X-ray crystallography and infrared
spectroscopy.
The stain used for amyloid deposits is congo red staining, which imparts pink to red color to the amyloid under ordinary light and apple-green birefringence under polarised microscopy.
AL type(Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis) of protein belongs to primary amyloidosis. It is seen in multiple myeloma and other monoclonal plasma cell proliferation.
The image shows a congo-red stained biopsy specimen with the following:
(A) Focal positive staining (orange-red) of amorphous extracellular material
(B) Apple-green birefringence under polarized light.
The next best step is to determine the type of precursor protein by immunohistochemistry,
immunoelectron microscopy, or extraction and biochemical analysis using mass spectrometry.",,C,
Q15,which of the following is an anti-apoptotic factor?,"a)PUMA
b)BAD
c)BAK
d)MCL1","Among the given options MCL1 is an anti-apoptotic factor.
Anti-apoptotic factors are BCL2, BCL-XL, and MCL1. They reside in outer mitochondrial
membranes as well as the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum membranes. By keeping the
mitochondrial outer membrane impermeable they prevent leakage of Cytochrome c and other death-inducing proteins into the cytosol.
pro-apoptotic factors are BAX and BAK. upon activation, BAX and BAK oligomerize within the outer mitochondrial protein and promote mitochondrial outer membrane permeability which    leads to leakage of death-inducing proteins into the cytosol.
Regulated apoptosis initiators are BAD, BIM, BID, puma, and Noxa. During cellular stress and damage, they get activated and initiate apoptosis.",,D,
Q16,Thymus is designed to recognize the MHC molecules presented to it and distinguish the cells as self and foreign. which gene is responsible for this?,"a)NOTCH1
b)E2A
c)Rag 1/2
d)AIRE","The above process is called central tolerance and the AIRE (AutoImmune REgulator) gene is necessary for this process.
Central tolerance is a process in which immature self-reactive T and B lymphocyte clones that recognize self-antigens during their maturation in the central lymphoid organs (Thymus for T cells, Bone marrow for B cells) are killed or rendered harmless.
The removal of self-reacting T lymphocytes in the thymus is called negative selection/ deletion. For this process, AIRE protein is needed. Mutations in the AIRE gene result in autoimmune
polyendocrinopathy.
B-cells undergo a process called receptor editing. when developing B cells encounter a
self-antigen, it formulates a change that makes the antigen unrecognizable. self-reacting B cells



can also undergo apoptosis.
other options:
option A: The NoTCH1 gene is associated with signal transduction. point mutations and translocations of this gene are associated with leukemias, lymphomas, and breast
carcinoma. NoTCH1 is the most commonly affected gene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).
option B: E2A also known as transcription factor(TCF3) is an important regulator of gene
expression in germinal center B cells. It is believed that E2A drives the expression of a set of
genes, including cyclin D, that collaborate with MYC to enable the rapid growth that characterizes Burkitt lymphoma.
option C: RAG1 and RAG2 are developed by B and T cells that permit the assembly of functional   antigen receptor genes. Adaptive immunity of B and T cells relies on their ability to diversify their
antigen receptor genes.",,D,
Q17,which of the following are the features of necrosis?,"a)1,2,4
b)1,2,3
c)2,3,4
d)1,3,4","The features of necrosis are:
• Disrupted cell membrane
• Induces inflammation
• swelling of the cell
The characteristics of necrosis are denaturation of cellular proteins, leakage of cellular contents through damaged membranes, local inflammation, and enzymatic digestion.
The causes are loss of oxygen supply, exposure to microbial toxins, burns, and other forms of chemical and physical injury.
when the cell membrane is damaged, lysosomal enzymes enter the cytoplasm and digest the cell. The contents from the cell leak through the damaged plasma membrane into the extracellular
space, where they elicit inflammation.
Morphological changes that occur in necrosis are:
• The cell size is increased.
• Cytoplasmic changes -
• Increased eosinophilic staining on H&amp;E specimens
• Moth-eaten appearance of the cytoplasm - due to vacuolated cytoplasmic organelles formed by enzymatic degradation
• Glassy and homogenous cytoplasm - due to loss of glycogen in the cytoplasm
•
• Nuclear changes -
• pyknosis - nucleus first shrinks and becomes more condensed
• karyorrhexis - fragmentation of the pyknotic nucleus



• karyolysis - nucleus fades away leaving behind only the cell membrane or empty cells",,B,
Q18,which of the following is not essential in the workup of a mosaic Turner syndrome?,"a)Anti-nuclear antibodies
b)Glucose tolerance test
c)Audiometry
d)Echocardiography","Among the given options, anti-nuclear antibodies are not essential in the workup of a mosaic Turner syndrome.
Turner syndrome occurs when females have a deletion or non-functional X chromosome.
Approximately 5o% of individuals with Turner syndrome have a condition called monosomy X (45, Xo), where they only have one X chromosome. The remaining 5o% have a mosaic
chromosomal component (45, X with mosaicism).
Mosaic Turner syndrome does not stem from inheritance. Instead, it is the outcome of a random    occurrence during cell division in the early development of the fetus. This results in a combination of cells in the affected individual's body, where some cells possess the usual two sex
chromosomes, while others have only one copy ofthe X chromosome.
The clinical features of Turner’s syndrome are mentioned in the image below:


prenatal diagnosis of Turner syndrome can be conducted through procedures like chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. If a prenatal ultrasound reveals fetal hydrops, cystic hygroma, or
cardiac defects, it may raise suspicions of Turner syndrome. However, the definitive confirmation of the diagnosis is typically done after birth through karyotype testing.
After receiving a diagnosis of Turner syndrome, it is essential to manage the condition by
assessing for any associated abnormalities such as cardiac anomalies, renal anomalies, and
learning disabilities. screening should be conducted as part of the initial evaluation, followed by regular periodic screenings.
During the initial diagnosis, patients should undergo renal ultrasonography and cardiovascular evaluation. Echocardiography is typically performed in infants and children, while MRI is
recommended for older girls and women. Regular monitoring of hearing, including serial
audiology evaluations, is recommended throughout life, with an audiology evaluation every 3 yrs



in children and every five years in adults.
Several laboratory tests are recommended for screening purposes at specific ages:
For patients aged four years and above, screening involves checking serum TSH to detect
autoimmune thyroiditis and conducting tissue transglutaminase testing with total IgA to screen for celiac disease.
For patients aged ten years and above, screening includes fasting blood glucose, glycated
hemoglobin, ALT, AST, serum creatinine, and urinalysis. These tests are performed to screen for conditions such as diabetes mellitus, fatty liver, and kidney disease.
For evaluation of vitamin D deficiency, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be measured between
9 to 11 years of age and every 2 to 3 years thereafter.",,A,2248-1472.PNG
Q19,Most common genetic cause of hypercoagulability is ______,"a)Factor V Leiden mutation

d)G20210A prothrombin gene mutation","The most common genetic cause of hypercoagulability is the Factor V Leiden mutation.
primary (inherited) hypercoagulability is most often caused by mutations in the factor V and prothrombin genes. Factor V Leiden mutation is the most common cause followed
by prothrombin G20210A mutation.
The Leiden mutation is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The mutation makes factor V resistant to cleavage and inactivation by protein C. This leads to the inactivation of an important    antithrombotic counterregulatory pathway.
protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III deficiency are rare causes of primary
hypercoagulability.
other options:
option B: protein C deficiency causes thrombosis in teenagers. It may also be induced by liver dysfunction, vitamin K antagonists, renal failure, DIC, and active thrombosis.
option C: Antithrombin III forms a complex with thrombin by binding to heparin on endothelial  cells. This complex inhibits coagulation. Its deficiency presents as early-age thrombosis (less than 50 years old) and it carries the highest risk for thrombotic events among the inherited
thrombophilias.
option D: The prothrombin G20210A mutation results in increased levels of
prothrombin which demonstrates a higher risk for arterial and venous thrombotic events.",,A,
Q20,Identify the histopathological image.,"a)Elastic fibres
b)Routine HPE
c)Amyloidosis
d)Collagen","The given histopathological slide shows congo red staining that is used in staining amyloid.
Amyloidosis refers to extracellular deposits of fibrillar proteins. Abnormal fibrils are produced by the aggregation of misfolded proteins. The fibrillar deposits bind a wide variety
of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, including heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate, and     plasma proteins, notably serum amyloid p component (SAp). Amyloid appears as an amorphous,



eosinophilic, hyaline, extracellular substance.
It could be classified as systemic, localized, and hereditary amyloidosis. Microscopically, all types
of amyloid deposits are made up of continuous, nonbranching fibrils. A characteristic  cross-β-pleated sheet conformation is visualized on X-ray crystallography and infrared spectroscopy.
The stain used for amyloid deposits is congo red staining, which imparts pink to red color to the amyloid under ordinary light and apple-green birefringence under polarised microscopy.
The image shows a congo-red stained biopsy specimen with the following:
(A) focal positive staining (orange-red) of amorphous extracellular material
(B) apple-green birefringence under polarized light
The next best step is to determine the type of precursor protein by immunohistochemistry,
immunoelectron microscopy, or extraction and biochemical analysis using mass spectrometry.

c)2,3,4
d)1,2,4","The statements associated with the BRCA1 gene are:
• Repair of ds DNA break
• Risk of development of ovarian cancer
• Tumor suppressor gene



BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes. Mutations of these genes are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in females. They play an important role in the repair
of double-stranded breaks in DNA.
In addition to breast cancer, women with BRCA1 mutations have a higher risk of developing
epithelial ovarian cancers, and men have a slightly higher risk of prostate cancer. BRCA2 is
associated with cancers of the ovary, prostate, pancreas, bile ducts, stomach, melanocytes, and B lymphocytes.
Few germline BRCA2 mutations can cause Fanconi anemia. Both BRCA proteins and Fanconi proteins function together in a DNA damage response network linked to homologous
recombination repair. Defects in this pathway can lead to the activation of a nonhomologous end-joining pathway that can result in telomere shortening.",,A,

pathogenesis?","a)IFN gamma
b)Bradykinin
c)C5a
d)Prostaglandin","Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is involved in the formation of   granulomas. It activates macrophages to differentiate into epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells, which are the main components of granulomas.



IFN-γ is the most important chemical mediator involved in the pathogenesis of granulomas. It is produced by T helper 1 (Th1) cells and other immune cells in response to a variety of stimuli,
including infections, autoimmune diseases, and foreign bodies.
Interferon-gamma-induced changes in the macrophages:
• Augmented ability of the macrophages to phagocytose and kill micro-organisms.
• Increased expression of class 2 MHC molecules to enhance antigen presentation.
• Increased secretion in presence of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and other inflammatory chemokines.
• Amplification of the Th1 response by producing more interleukin-12.
Granulomas are characteristic of a number of diseases, including tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and Crohn's disease. In these diseases, IFN-γ plays a central role in the formation of granulomas,
which help to contain and eliminate the offending agent. However, granulomas can also be
formed in response to non-harmful stimuli, such as foreign bodies or allergens. In these cases, granulomas can be harmful and can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction.
B. Bradykinin: Bradykinin is a vasodilator that is involved in the inflammatory response. It is not directly involved in the formation of granulomas.
C. Complement C5a: Complement C5a is a chemoattractant that attracts neutrophils and other    inflammatory cells to the site of infection or injury. It is not directly involved in the formation of granulomas.

Q24,"A patient with rapidly progressive renal failure (RPRF) presents with crescentic
glomerulonephritis which is found to be pauci-immune. which of the following antibodies are involved in this condition?","a)ANA
b)ANCA
c)Anti-GBM
d)Anti-PLA2R","ANCA - antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody is the most common antibody associated with pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis.
There are two main types of ANCA: myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA and proteinase-3
(PR3)-ANCA. MPO-ANCA is more strongly associated with renal-limited vasculitis, while PR3-ANCA is more strongly associated with systemic vasculitis.
Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is a clinical entity with features of nephritic
syndrome and rapid loss of renal function. It is a syndrome associated with severe glomerular
injury with necrosis and the formation of crescents, but it does not denote a specific etiologic form of glomerulonephritis.
In most cases, RPGN is immune-mediated. Circulating anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies
(ANCAs) are detected in the pauci-immune type of RPGN. serum analyses for anti-GBM
antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, and ANCAs are helpful in the diagnosis of specific subtypes Based on immunologic findings, RPGN is classified as:
Anti-GBM antibody-mediated disease (Type I) is characterized by linear GBM deposits of IgG and C3 on immunofluorescence and includes renal limited disease and Goodpasture's disease. Here,



the antibodies are produced against a peptide present in the noncollagenous domain of the α3   chain of collagen IV of the GBM. This serves as the antigen which is common to the alveoli and the glomerulus.
Immune complex deposition (Type II) is characterized by granular deposits of antibodies and    complement on immunofluorescence and can be a complication of any of the immune complex nephritides which include:
• Postinfectious glomerulonephritis
• Lupus nephritis
• IgA nephropathy
• Henoch-schδnlein purpura
Pauci-immune (Type III) exhibits no characteristic immunoglobulin or complement deposits on immunofluorescence. It includes
• ANCA-associated
• Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
• Microscopic polyangiitis

option A: ANA - antinuclear antibody: ANA is a non-specific antibody seen in most autoimmune   disorders; including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma. ANA is not typically associated with pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis.
option C: Anti-GBM - anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody: directed against the
glomerular basement membrane. Anti-GBM is associated with anti-GBM disease/Goodpasture
syndrome, a type of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis that is characterized by linear deposits of IgG along the BM.

Q25,sickle cells have _________:,"a)High mechanical fragility and high osmotic fragility
b)High mechanical fragility and low osmotic fragility
c)Low mechanical fragility and high osmotic fragility
d)Low mechanical fragility and low osmotic fragility","sickle cells have high mechanical fragility and low osmotic fragility.
when subjected to mechanical stress, such as shearing forces. trauma, turbulence. sickle cells     have high mechanical fragility because they are more rigid and less deformable than normal red blood cells. This makes them more likely to break apart when subjected to mechanical stress.
The higher concentration of hemoglobin in sickle cells makes them less likely to break apart when subjected to osmotic stress; such as changes in the concentration of salt - de/overhydration, CKD,  etc. This is because the sickle cell hemoglobin (Hbs) protein is more resistant to swelling in
hypotonic solutions.
Conditions that can cause increased mechanical fragility of red blood cells:
• sickle cell anemia



• Thalassemia: Thalassemia can cause RBCs to become smaller and less flexible. This can make them more mechanically fragile.
• Red blood cell membrane disorders
• G6PD deficiency
• Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
• Malaria

Q26,B cells express IgM and IgD antibodies at the same time due to which phenomenon?,"a)somatic hypermutation
b)Alternative RNA splicing
c)Affinity maturation
d)Allelic exclusion","B cells express IgM and IgD antibodies at the same time due to alternative RNA splicing.
Alternative RNA splicing is the process by which different proteins are produced from the same RNA transcript by splicing it in different ways.
Mature circulating B cells initially express IgM and IgD antibodies on their surfaces before they
are stimulated to produce specific antibodies. The heavy chains in IgM and IgD are mu (μ)
and delta (δ), respectively. The mu and delta genes for these heavy chains are located proximal to  the VDJ encoding regions (i.e., variable, diversity, and joining regions) of the heavy chain locus. A primary RNA transcript of this entire region is produced, which then undergoes alternative RNA   processing, enabling the production of both transmembrane IgM and IgD on B cells.
other options:
options A and C: somatic hypermutation is a cellular response by which the immune system
adapts to the new foreign elements that confront it. They do so by adding nucleotides in V gene regions of heavy and light chains, resulting in a better fit of antigen with the antibodies. This
hence increases the affinity of antibodies to antigens. Due to this, the subset of plasma cells with these improved hypervariable regions are more strongly selected by the antigen and therefore
constitute a larger part of the population of antibody-producing cells. This process is called affinity maturation.



option D: Allelic exclusion is the process by which a cell expresses one of the two alleles of the gene and excludes the other allele.
B cells are diploid, therefore, each B cell has six gene segment pools related to antibody chains:
• Two heavy-chain pools (one from each parent) and
• Four light-chain pools (one κ and one λ from each parent).
However, each B cell uses only two of the six gene segment pools: one out of the two heavy-chain pools (maternal and paternal) and one out of the four light-chain pools. Thus, each B cell must     choose not only between its κ and λ light-chain pools but also between its maternal and paternal  light-chain and heavy-chain pools. This process of choosing is by allelic exclusion.",,B,
Q27,A 75-year-old woman with diabetes and hypertension has a biopsy of her heart that is shown below. what is the diagnosis?,"a)Dilated cardiomyopathy

c)Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
d)Atrial fibrillation","The hyaline, eosinophilic deposits seen on the biopsy point to a diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis, which most commonly leads to restrictive cardiomyopathy.
Transthyretin is the major component of senile cardiac amyloid deposits. It
is a normal serum protein synthesized in the liver that transports thyroxine and retinol-binding  protein. The deposits may accumulate subendocardially, and slowly expand - compressing the     myocardial fibres - leading to pressure atrophy of myocaridial fibres. The stain used for amyloid deposits is congo red staining, which imparts pink to red color to the amyloid under ordinary
light and apple-green birefringence under polarised microscopy.
presentation of cardiac amyloidosis:
• Restrictive cardiomyopathy- most common
• Asymptomatic
• Dilation
• Arrhythmias
• Ischemic disease
The echocardiographic findings in cardiac amyloidosis may include a distinctive granular,
sparkling appearance of the thickened cardiac walls, representative of the infiltrative process.
Despite the thickened ventricular walls, the ECG in cardiac amyloidosis typically demonstrates
low limb lead voltage, often accompanied by ventricular conduction delay and pseudoinfarction    patterns. suspect cardiac amyloidosis when there is thickened ventricular walls with an ECG that shows low voltage. Amyloid infiltration can be detected with gadolinium enhancement on MRI.
A. Dilated cardiomyopathy/DCM is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes enlarged and    weakened. This makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood effectively. DCM can be caused by a variety of factors, including coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes.
B. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy/HoCM is a condition in which the IV septum becomes thickened and is typically genetic. on biopsy, myocardial disarray would be noted.

b)ER+ / HER2 neu+
c)ER- / HER2 neu-
d)ER+ / HER2 neu-, high proliferation","Luminal type A breast cancer is defined as estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) positive, HER2-negative, and low to moderate ki-67 proliferation index.
This means that the tumor cells have ER and/or PR proteins on their surface and that they are not overexpressing the HER2 gene. The ki-67 proliferation index is a marker of the rate of tumor
proliferation. A low to moderate ki-67 index indicates that the tumor cells are dividing slowly; ie:
less aggressive.
Luminal type A breast cancer is the most common subtype of breast cancer and has the best
prognosis. It is typically a low-grade, slow-growing tumor that is responsive to hormone therapy.
Luminal A type is more commonly associated with BRCA2 mutations. Hormone receptor-positive tumors are responsive to hormonal chemotherapeutic agents like tamoxifen and aromatase
inhibitors. In Her-2 negative cases, trastuzumab is not effective as it is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody directed against HER-2.
option B: ER+ / HER2neu+: This is a separate subtype that is more aggressive, and responds to targeted chemotherapy.
option C: ER- / HER2neu-: ER-negative breast cancer is a subtype that is not responsive to hormone therapy.

b)Megaloblastic anemia
c)Aplastic anemia
d)Thalassemia","The most likely diagnosis in this case is megaloblastic anemia, given the patient's vegetarian diet, macrocytosis, and low hemoglobin level.



Megaloblastic anemia can be caused by a deficiency of vitamin B12 or folate. Vegetarians are at increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency because vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal
products. other conditions can also cause megaloblastic anemia, such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. other causes of high MCV, such as liver disease, alcoholism, and  hypothyroidism.
Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by a low hemoglobin level and a microcytic (small cell)    anemia. Iron is essential for the production of hemoglobin, and a deficiency of iron can lead to a decrease in hemoglobin levels. However, IDA is typically associated with a low MCV, not a high   MCV.
In Aplastic anemia the bone marrow does not produce enough progenitor cells. It can be caused     by autoimmune diseases, medications, and radiation. Aplastic anemia can lead to a decrease in all types of blood cells and is associated with a low MCV and a low hemoglobin level, not a high MCV.

Q30,which of the following proteins shows a marked increase in size in nephrotic syndrome on serum electrophoresis?,"a)Albumin
b)Alpha 2 globulin
c)Beta globulin
d)Gamma globulin","Alpha 2 globulin becomes relatively more prominent in nephrotic syndrome.
Alpha 2  globulin, being a relatively large compared to others is not lost through urine as it is
unable to pass through the glomeruli in nephrotic syndrome. Hence the α2 band which includes
α2 macroglobulin is very prominent in serum protein electrophoresis of a nephrotic syndrome patient.
ALL proteins are lost in nephrotic syndrome and their size is relatively reducied, except alpha 2 globulin:
Albumin is the most abundant protein in the blood and is responsible for maintaining osmotic
pressure. In nephrotic syndrome, albumin leaks out of the glomeruli into the urine. This leads to a decrease in serum albumin levels, but the remaining albumin molecules may become larger due to increased glycosylation.
Beta globulins are a group of proteins that play a role in transporting hormones and other molecules in the blood.

Q37,Match the following genetic disorders with their inheritance patterns:,"a)A2, B4, C3, D1
b)A3, B4, C2, D1
c)A1, B4, C3, D2
d)A2, B4, C1, D3","cystic fibrosis: cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder; both parents must carry a copy of the mutated gene in order for the child to be affected.
Leber optic neuropathy: Leber optic neuropathy is a mitochondrial genetic disorder. This means that the mutated gene is located on the mitochondrial DNA, which is DNA that is outside of the  nucleus of the cell. Mitochondrial DNA is inherited solely from the mother.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy: Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive genetic
disorder. This means that the mutated gene is located on the X chromosome. Males have only one X chromosome, so if they inherit a mutated copy of the gene, they will be affected. Females have



two X chromosomes, so if they inherit one mutated copy of the gene, they will be carriers.
Myotonic dystrophy: Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder. This means that only one parent needs to carry a copy of the mutated gene in order for their child to be
affected.

Q38,which of the following conditions will not show gastric acid secretion after the injection of pentagastrin?,"a)Normal healthy individual
b)Gastrinoma
c)pernicious anemia
d)Duodenal ulcer","The correct answer is pernicious anemia that can have atrophic gastritis.
pentagastrin is a synthetic hormone that stimulates the release of gastrin from the G cells of the stomach. Gastrin stimulates gastric acid secretion. In pernicious anemia there are:
• Antibodies to parietal cells and intrinsic factor
• Reduced serum pepsinogen I concentration
• Hypergastrinemia
• Endocrine cell hyperplasia → carcinoid tumors
• vitamin B12 deficiency (pernicious anemia)
• Defective gastric acid secretion (achlorhydria)
After the injection of pentagastrin, patients with atrophic gastritis/pernicious anemia will typically show a weak or absent gastric acid response due to destruction of the parietal cells.
other options:
Normal healthy individual: A normal healthy individual will show gastric H+ secretion after the injection of pentagastrin. This is because gastrin is a potent stimulator of gastric acid secretion.
Gastrinoma: A gastrinoma is a tumor of the G cells of the stomach. Gastrinomas produce excess   gastrin, which leads to hypergastrinemia and increased gastric acid secretion. Therefore, patients with gastrinomas will show a vigorous gastric acid response after the injection of pentagastrin.
Duodenal ulcer: Duodenal ulcers are caused by an imbalance between gastric acid secretion and   mucosal defense mechanisms. Duodenal ulcer patients typically have normal or increased gastric acid secretion. Therefore, duodenal ulcer patients will typically show a vigorous gastric acid
response after the injection of pentagastrin.",,C,
Q39,"You have a 55-year-old male patient with a history of infective endocarditis presents with
high-grade fever, new-onset murmurs, and splinter hemorrhages. what is the correct way to collect blood culture samples?","a)3 sets of culture samples, 2 from the peripheral lines and 1 from the affected valve with a gap of 3o minutes between the collection of each
b)2 samples, 1 from the periphery and 1 from atrium, with a gap of 3o minutes between the collection of each
c)1 from the periphery
d)1 from the blood and 1 from the urinary catheter","Correct way to collect sample is 3 sets of culture samples, 2 from the peripheral lines and 1 from the affected valve with a gap of 3o minutes between the collection of each
The American Heart Association recommends collecting three sets of blood culture samples for
patients with suspected infective endocarditis. one set should be collected from the affected valve, if possible. The other two sets should be collected from peripheral veins. There should be a gap of  at least 3o minutes between the collection of each set.",,A,
Q40,"A 26-year-old patient presents with a history of headache, fever, and neck stiffness for several days. cerebrospinal fluid (cSF) analysis reveals the following parameters: protein 62, glucose  2o mg/dl (plasma glucose 14o mg/dl), and white blood cells composed of lymphocytes. what   is the most likely diagnosis?","a)coxsackievirus meningitis
b)HSV1 meningitis
c)Bacterial meningitis
d)Tubercular meningitis","The lymphocytic predominance and low CSF glucose points to a diagnosis of tubercular
meningitis.
Note: CSF glucose/Serum glucose &lt; o.4 -&gt; Hypoglycorrhachia; Secondary to glycolysis by bacteria or leukocytes, and/or by altered glucose transport.
Tuberculous meningitis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is caused by the formation
of tubercles in the brain parenchyma. This happens during the hematogenous spread of the bacilli during primary infection. It can also be due to the rupture of a subependymal tubercle into the
subarachnoid space.
Tuberculous meningitis presents as a subacute infection and has a longer course than bacterial meningitis. ocular nerve palsy is a common association as there is marked meningeal
involvement at the base of the brain. The patient can also develop hydrocephalus.
The CSF sample shows a pellicle or cobweb-like clots. Acid-fast bacilli can be best isolated from
these. There is usually lymphocytic leukocytosis, low glucose concentration, and elevated proteins. CSF culture remains the gold standard for diagnosis.
The clinical triad of fever, headache, and nuchal rigidity is common to all types of meningitis.
Nuchal rigidity is the resistance of the neck to passive flexion and is pathognomonic of meningeal irritation. kernig's and Brudzinski's signs are other features of meningeal irritation. Raised
intracranial pressure (ICP) is a complication that presents as papilledema, disorientation, or dilated poorly reactive pupils.
Important features of TB meningitis:
• Common between 6 months and 4 years of age
• usually spread by hematogenous route
• Gelatinous exudate infiltrates corticomeningeal blood vessels leading to hydrocephalus.
• Three stages
• Prodromal stage
• stage of meningitis
• stage of coma



• CSF study shows reduced sugar level, increased protein level, and lymphocytosis.
• Treatment includes antitubercular drugs for 12 months and corticosteroids (to reduce neurologic sequelae).
other options:
Coxsackie meningitis is a viral meningitis. (aseptic meningitis) The CSF findings in Coxsackie
meningitis are typically normal-elevated protein and lymphocytic pleocytosis. The glucose level in the CSF is usually normal.
The CSF findings in HSv encephalitis are typically normal-elevated protein and lymphocytic pleocytosis, and RBCs due to hemorrhagic necrosis of the temporal lobe. CSF Glucose levels would be normal.
The CSF findings in bacterial meningitis are typically elevated protein, neutrophilic
pleocytosis and low glucose level.",,D,
Q41,The protease of V.cholera disrupts the extracellular part of which of the following proteins?,"a)occludin
b)Integrin
c)cadherin
d)claudin","The protease of vibrio cholera disrupts the extracellular part of occludin.
occludin is a transmembrane protein that is found in tight junctions; prevents the leakage of
fluids and molecules across the epithelium. The protease of v. cholera cleaves occludin, which
disrupts the tight junctions and allows for the leakage of fluids and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen. This leads to the profuse diarrhea that is characteristic of cholera.
vibrio cholerae in addition to the cholera toxin (CT) produces some additional toxins such as,
• zonula occludens toxin, which alters the intestinal permeability by acting on intestinal epithelial cell tight junctions (which are also called zonula occludens)
• Accessory cholera enterotoxin.
zonula occludens:
• Also known as tight junctions
• Characteristically surround the apical margins of the cells in epithelia such as the intestinal mucosa, the walls of the renal tubules, and the choroid plexus.
• Also important to the endothelial barrier function and endothelium-dependent vasodilation.
• Made up of ridges- half from one cell and a half from another cell- which adhere so strongly that there is no space between the cells.
• Three families of transmembrane proteins are involved:
other options:
Integrin: transmembrane proteins that mediate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. They are not involved in tight junctions.
Cadherin: transmembrane proteins that mediate cell adhesion to other cells. They are not involved in tight junctions.



claudins are transmembrane proteins that are also found in tight junctions. However, the protease of v. cholera does not cleave claudins.
