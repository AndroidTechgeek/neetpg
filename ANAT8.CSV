Q1,A 6-month-old boy was brought to the casualty with seizures. The pediatrician tries to do CsF sampling. what are the structures punctured by the pediatrician while piercing through the marked structure?,"a) scalp, dura, arachnoid
b) scalp, epicranium, endocranium and dura
c) scalp, synchondral membrane, dura, arachnoid
d) pericranium, dura, arachnoid","The given image shows the skull of an infant and the arrow points towards the anterior fontanelle. The procedure of collecting CSF from the anterior fontanelle is called ventricular tapping. The various structures pierced are the scalp, dura, and arachnoid.
Fontanelle tap/ percutaneous ventricular puncture:
A fontanelle tap or percutaneous ventricular puncture is performed in infants without access to a Vp shunt, who require urgent ventricular decompression and have an open anterior fontanelle. The infants’ open fontanelle is directly punctured with a butterfly needle to enter the lateral ventricle to collect CSF samples or release the pressure or place a drain/catheter.
A 25-gauge butterfly needle is inserted through the anterolateral aspect of the anterior fontanelle (away from the midline, avoiding the superior sagittal sinus).
The scalp is a soft tissue that covers the calvaria of the skull. It consists of five layers (Mnemonic: SCALP). Below the scalp and the calvaria lie the meningeal layers, namely, pachymeninges [arachnoid + dura mater (P-AD)] and leptomeninges [arachnoid + pia mater (L-AP)]. one must reach the subarachnoid space below the arachnoid layer to collect or tap CSF. So, the layers pierced in the order are as follows:
• Skin
• Connective tissue (superficial fascia) with blood vessels and nerves
• Aponeurosis (galea aponeurotica) with occipitofrontalis muscle
• Loose areolar (subaponeurotic) tissue
• Pericranium
• Dura mater
• Arachnoid membrane",175-166.PNG,A,191-187.PNG
Q2,A 12-year-old presented with fever and difficulty swallowing. He had swelling in the marked region and was advised to undergo surgery. post-surgery the gauze continued to soak with blood. which of the following vessels must have been injured?,"a) Tonsillar branch of facial artery
b) Ascending pharyngeal artery
c) paratonsillar vein
d) Retromandibular vein","The given image is a cadaveric specimen with the arrow pointing towards, the tonsillar fossa, and the given clinical vignette is suggestive of tonsillitis. post tonsillectomy hemorrhage is commonly venous in origin, from the paratonsillar/ external palatine vein.
Torrential hemorrhage can be due to injury to an aberrantly large or aberrantly placed tonsillar arterial branch of the facial artery.
Blood supply of the tonsils:
Arterial supply:
• The tonsillar branch of the facial artery is the main supply.
• Ascending palatine branch of the facial artery.
• Ascending pharyngeal branch of the external carotid artery.
• Dorsal lingual branches of the lingual artery.
• Descending palatine branches of the maxillary artery.
venous supply:
• veins from the tonsils drain into paratonsillar vein which joins the common facial vein and pharyngeal venous plexus.
Types of Hemorrhage seen during/post tonsillectomy:
• primary hemorrhage: occurs during surgery due to injury to blood vessels.
• Reactionary hemorrhage: It occurs within 24 hours of surgery.
• secondary hemorrhage: It occurs between 24 hours to 1o days (most common between 5th to 8th postoperative days).",176-168.PNG,C,193-190.PNG

b) B
c) C
d) D","The given clinical situation with a positive card test and an inability to flex the distal interphalangeal joint of the 4th and 5th digits, suggests an ulnar nerve injury. The most likely site of injury would thus be medial epicondyle: site C.
Injury at the medial epicondyle damages the ulnar nerve, leading to paralysis of flexor carpi ulnaris (loss of ulnar deviation) and medial half of flexor digitorum profundus (loss of distal interphalangeal joint flexion). It leads to hypothenar paralysis (lead to atrophy) and sensory loss. The positive card test is due to the weakness of palmar interossei leading to loss of adduction.
other options:
• option A: Radial groove - Radial nerve

Q12,A boy with a history of a fall from a tree presents with a lurching gait and dragging of his feet. which of the following structures are involved?,"a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4","The structure involved in causing lurching gait in the child is gluteus medius (marked as 2).
The gluteus medius originates from the outer surface of the ilium between the anterior and posterior gluteal lines. It is supplied by the superior gluteal nerve.
when the gluteus medius and minimus are paralyzed, the pelvis sinks down on the unsupported (normal) side, when the patient tries to stand on the affected limb. This leads to a positive Trendelenburg's sign with a characteristic lurching gait - the patient lurches towards the affected side with contralateral pelvis drop.
