Q1,The image of a drug is given below. It is used in which of the following conditions?,"a)subglottic stenosis
b)Rhinocerebral mucormycosis
c)Adenoidectomy
d)Tympanoplasty","The given drug is Mitomycin-C. It is used topically in the management of subglottic stenosis.
Mitomycin-C is derived from the streptomyces caespitosus bacteria. It can modify wound healing at a molecular level by inhibiting DNA synthesis by cross-linking DNA, acting like an alkylating



agent (cell cycle non-specific). It has been used to inhibit post-surgical scar formation and as a chemotherapeutic agent for solid tumors.
Mitomycin-C is employed in the treatment of superficial bladder tumors, postoperative glottic and subglottic stenosis, and tracheal scarring after tracheal reconstruction surgery.
subglottic stenosis is the narrowing of the airway in the subglottis, clinically presenting with
biphasic stridor. Diagnosis is made if the subglottic diameter is &lt;4mm in full-term infants and if the subglottic diameter is &lt;3mm, in the case of premature infants.
Myer-Cotton grading of subglottic stenosis is as follows:

Grade	obstruction
Grade I	≤5o%
Grade II	51-7o%
Grade III	71-99%
Grade IV	No detectable lum en",3286-2041.PNG,A,
Q2,"Following total thyroidectomy, a patient started having difficulty in breathing, and repeated attempts to extubate were unsuccessful. The most probable cause is ___","a)superior laryngeal nerve injury
b)unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury
c)Bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury
d)Hematoma","The clinical picture of breathing difficulty and unsuccessful attempts at extubation after total thyroidectomy is suggestive of bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.
Thyroid surgery may cause injury to both external (ELN) and recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLN).  The upper part of the RLN is closely related to the inferior thyroid artery. unilateral RLN injury may be asymptomatic but in a few may cause hoarseness of voice.
The relation of RLN with the inferior thyroid artery is shown in the image below:






Bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy can also occur postoperatively and the presentation is acute. other causes of it include carcinoma of the cervical esophagus, carcinoma thyroid, and   cervical lymphadenopathy. All the intrinsic muscles are paralyzed in this condition.
The vocal cords lie in the median or paramedian position due to the unopposed action of the
cricothyroid muscles. This leads to dyspnoea and stridor, necessitating emergency tracheostomy.
For long-standing cases of bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, there are two main treatment options. one approach involves performing a tracheostomy with a speaking valve. Alternatively,   cord lateralizing procedures can be considered, such as transverse cordotomy, partial
arytenoidectomy, injection of botulinum toxin, thyroplasty type II, or re-innervation procedures.
Transverse cordotomy (kashima operation) involves excising laterally the soft tissue at the junction of the membranous cord and the vocal process ofthe arytenoid with laser.
partial arytenoidectomy involves excising the medial part of the arytenoid with a laser.
Thyroplasty type II creates a lateral expansion of the larynx which is similar to vocal cord lateralization.
Reinnervation procedures innervate paralyzed posterior cricoarytenoid muscle by implanting a nerve-muscle pedicle of sternohyoid or omohyoid muscle with its nerve supply from ansa

Q3,"A female patient presents with nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, and loss of smell. On
examination, foul-smelling discharge and yellowish-green crusts are present in the nasal
cavity. she is found to have merciful anosmia. which of the following finding can also be seen during the examination of her nose?","a)Roomy nasal cavity
b)Nasal polyps
c)Inferior turbinate hypertrophy
d)Foreign body","The clinical vignette of anosmia, foul-smelling discharge, and yellowish-green crusts in the nasal   cavity points to a diagnosis of atrophic rhinitis. The other examination finding that is observed in atrophic rhinitis is a roomy nasal cavity.
Atrophic rhinitis is a chronic inflammation of the nose characterized by atrophy of nasal mucosa and turbinate bones. The exact etiology of this condition is not known.
The patients present with nasal obstruction, foul odor, merciful anosmia, greenish-grey crusting of the nasal passage, pale nasal mucosa, atrophied nasal turbinates, and epistaxis following the
removal of the crusts. Roomy nasal cavity is seen due to the resorption of bones of the turbinates.
Treatment options for atrophic rhinitis include nasal irrigation using warm saline or an alkaline solution composed of sodium bicarbonate, sodium biborate, and sodium chloride (1:1:2) mixed   with water.
Local antibiotics such as kemicetine antiozaena solution, which contains chloromycetin,
oestradiol, and vitamin D2, can be used. Topical applications of 25% glucose in glycerine,     estradiol spray, and systemic administration of streptomycin, potassium iodide, or placental extract may also be employed.
surgical management options include young's operation, where flaps are raised within the nasal vestibule and both nostrils are completely closed, then opened after 6 months. During this time, the nasal mucosa may revert to a more normal state, and crusting is reduced. Another option is  the modified young's operation, where the nostrils are partially closed to avoid discomfort. The   results of this modified approach are comparable to the original young's operation.



Additionally, the nasal cavity can be narrowed through submucosal injection of teflon paste or by inserting fat, cartilage, or teflon strips beneath the mucoperiosteum.
The image below shows the endoscopic appearance of atrophic rhinitis:


other options:
option B: Nasal polyps are non-neoplastic masses of the edematous nasal or sinus mucosa. Nasal polyps can be antrochoanal polyps or ethmoidal polyps.
option C: Inferior turbinate hypertrophy is associated with various mucosal diseases which     include allergic rhinitis, infectious rhinitis, and vasomotor rhinitis. It can cause chronic nasal obstruction.
option D: Foreign body nose is commonly seen in children and the child presents with unilateral, foul-smelling nasal discharge.",,A,3291-2044.PNG
Q4,"A patient presents to the emergency with epistaxis. There was no relief on pinching the
nostrils. Nasal packing was done but the patient still continues to bleed. what would be the next appropriate step in the management of this patient?","a)Ligation of external carotid artery
b)Ligation of internal carotid artery
c)Ligation of sphenopalatine artery
d)Ligation of maxillary artery","The next appropriate step for the management of epistaxis which was not controlled by pinching of nostrils and nasal packing would be ligation of the sphenopalatine artery, as it is the main
artery contributing to kiesselbach’s plexus.
Little's area is the most common site of epistaxis. It is present in the anteroinferior part of the septum. Four arteries anastomose here to form kiesselbach’s plexus.
The image below shows the blood supply of the nasal septum and areas of epistaxis.





The first step in treating epistaxis is to pinch the nose with the thumb and index finger for about 5 minutes. The patient should sit leaning slightly forward over a basin to spit out blood and breathe through the mouth (Hippocratic or Trotter’s method).


If the bleeding point is localized, cauterization can be done with electrocautery. In cases of
uncontrolled bleeding or when the bleeding is posterior into the throat, anterior or posterior nasal packing may be required, respectively. If bleeding continues despite these measures, endoscopic     procedures or vessel ligation close to the bleeding point can be considered.






The recommended hierarchy of ligation of vessels in a patient of epistaxis is the sphenopalatine artery first, the internal maxillary artery followed by the external carotid artery, and finally the  anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries.
The sphenopalatine artery is ligated first through a trans-nasal endoscope (transnasal endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation) at the sphenopalatine foramen which is situated at the posterior    end of the middle turbinate.
However, if the bleeding persists, internal maxillary artery ligation is done at the pterygopalatine fossa via the caldwell-Luc approach. If bleeding is still not controlled, external carotid artery
ligation is done just above the origin of the superior thyroid artery.
If the bleeding site is located superior to the level of the middle turbinate, the anterior and
posterior ethmoidal arteries should be ligated via Lynch incision in the medial wall of the orbit.",,C,3292-2046.PNG;3292-2045.PNG;3293-2048.PNG;3293-2047.PNG
Q5,"A patient post-tonsillectomy in the recovery room starts bleeding from the operative site. On examination, blood clots are seen. what will be your immediate management?","a)shift to OT, remove the clots, and cauterize/ligate the vessel
b)shift to OT, start IV antibiotics, and pack the tonsillar fossa
c)Give anticoagulants, repeated gargling, and wait for 24 hours
d)Do blood transfusion and wait and watch","The given clinical picture suggests reactionary hemorrhage post-tonsillectomy. The immediate management is to shift the patient to OT, remove the clots, and cauterize/ligate the bleeding     vessel.
Hemorrhage is a common complication of tonsillectomy. It can be primary, reactionary, or secondary.
primary hemorrhage occurs at the time of operation. It can be controlled by pressure, ligation, or electrocoagulation of the bleeding vessels.
Reactionary hemorrhage occurs within 24 hours. It may be due to improper clipping action of the superior constrictor muscle.
The tonsillar artery perforates the superior constrictor and ramifies in the tonsil. Therefore, the presence of a clot can hinder the clipping action of the superior constrictor muscle, leading to    hemorrhage. slippage of ligature, or blood pressure returning to normal are other causes.
It is managed by removing the clot and application of pressure or vasoconstrictor. Ligation or electrocoagulation of the bleeding vessels is done under anesthesia if the above measures fail.
The image below shows the relation between the superior constrictor muscle and the tonsillar artery at the tonsillar bed.


secondary hemorrhage is usually seen between the 5th to 1oth postoperative day, due to sepsis   and premature separation of the membrane. Clots are removed, IV antibiotics are given and the bleeding vessel is electrocoagulated or ligated if bleeding continues.",,A,3294-2049.PNG
Q6,"A patient with a history of chronic ear infection presents with fever, headache, vomiting,   irritability, and confusion. His CT brain is shown in the image below. what is the possible diagnosis?","a)Temporal lobe abscess
b)Cerebellar abscess
c)subdural abscess
d)Meningitis","The clinical vignette depicting features of CNs infection (fever, headache, vomiting, and
confusion) in a patient with a chronic ear infection and the CT image showing a ring-enhancing lesion point to a diagnosis of a temporal lobe abscess.



Temporal lobe abscess is an intracranial complication that can arise from chronic suppurative otitis media (CsOM).
Brain abscess typically progresses through four stages. The first stage is the stage of invasion
(initial encephalitis), which often goes unnoticed. symptoms such as headache, malaise, low-grade fever, and drowsiness may be present.
The second stage is the stage of localization (latent abscess), during which a capsule forms around the abscess, effectively localizing the pus.
The third stage is the stage of enlargement (manifest abscess). The abscess enlarges, leading to     increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and the development of edema surrounding the abscess. As a result, symptoms worsen.
The final stage is the stage of termination (rupture of abscess). At this point, the abscess expands and eventually ruptures into the ventricle or subarachnoid space, which can result in potentially  fatal meningitis.
signs of raised ICP may include headache, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, drowsiness, confusion, papilledema, and coma.
Characteristic findings associated with temporal lobe abscess include nominal aphasia,
homonymous hemianopia, seizures, contralateral motor paralysis, pupillary changes, and oculomotor palsy.
The preferred diagnostic imaging modality for temporal lobe abscess is a CT scan of the brain. This imaging study reveals a ring-enhancing lesion indicative of a brain abscess.
Medical treatment involves initiating intravenous antibiotics, typically metronidazole. Raised ICP can be addressed using dexamethasone or mannitol.
surgical intervention is the definitive management and involves drainage of the abscess followed by radical mastoidectomy to address the underlying CsOM.
Other options:
Option B: Cerebellar abscess is a form of brain abscess and is usually associated with an otogenic source of infection. It can occur as a direct extension through Trautmann's triangle or via
retrograde thrombophlebitis.
An MRI image showing cerebellar abscess is given below:





option C: subdural abscess refers to the focal collection of purulent material between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater.
An MRI image showing subdural abscess is given below:


option D: Meningitis is the inflammation ofthe leptomeninges which includes the arachnoid  mater and pia mater. It can be due to an infectious or noninfectious etiology. It presents with fever, vomiting, neck stiffness, and signs of meningeal irritation. Ring enhancing lesion on
neuroimaging is not a feature of meningitis.",3288-2042.PNG,A,3296-2051.PNG;3296-2050.PNG
