Q1,"A 27-year-old IT professional has presented to you with intense watering, redness, and
foreign body sensation in the eye for the past 2 months. He took out his contact lens and
applied eye lubricants to help alleviate his ailment, but it didn't provide any relief. what is the most probable diagnosis?","a)Acute trachoma
b)Follicular conjunctivitis
c)Giant papillary conjunctivitis
d)spring catarrh","The clinical history of watering, redness, and foreign body sensation in a contact lens user, along with the image showing giant papillae in the conjunctiva, suggests a probable diagnosis of giant   papillary conjunctivitis.
Giant papillary conjunctivitis is a severe form of mechanically induced papillary conjunctivitis. It is most commonly associated with contact lens wear. It can also be associated with ocular
prostheses, exposed sutures, and scleral buckles.
patients usually present with redness, foreign body sensation, increased mucus production,
itching, blurring, and loss of contact lens tolerance. on examination, giant papillae are seen on the upper tarsal conjunctiva with hyperemia. Focal apical ulceration and whitish scarring may  develop on larger papillae.
papillae are reddish, flat-topped, raised areas that give a red and velvety appearance to the tarsal conjunctiva. These are caused by the hyperplasia of the normal vascular system, with
glomerulus-like bunches of capillaries growing into the epithelium.
The image below shows papillae in the tarsal conjunctiva.





Treatment includes the removal of the offending cause. Mast cell stabilizers, such as sodium
cromoglycate, and drugs like azelastine and olopatadine, which have combined antihistamine and mast cell–stabilizing effects, are effective. Steroids can be used for resistant cases.
other options:
option A: In acute trachoma, sago-like follicles are characteristically seen. It is caused by chlamydia trachomatis. The SAFE strategy is used in the management of trachoma.
The image below shows sago-like follicles in trachoma.


option B: In follicular conjunctivitis, follicles are seen. It is most commonly caused by herpes and  adenoviruses. Follicles are greyish-white raised areas on fornices and palpebral conjunctiva. These are formed due to the localized aggregations of lymphocytes in the sub-epithelial adenoid layer.
The image shows follicles.





option D: In spring catarrh (vernal catarrh), cobblestone appearance is a papillary reaction in the palpebral conjunctiva, ropy discharge, and Maxwell-Lyon sign are present. Horner-Trantas spots  that are discrete, whitish, raised dots along the limbus can also be seen. It is more common
during summer.
The image below shows Horner-Trantas spots.",3055-1863.PNG,C,3060-1868.PNG;3060-1867.PNG;3061-1870.PNG;3061-1869.PNG
Q2,A 6o-year-old patient with progressive painless loss of vision presents to the ophthalmology    OPD. The fundus image of the patient is given below. what could be the probable finding and the cause of it?,"a)soft exudate, hypertension
b)Hard exudate, diabetes mellitus
c)Flame-shaped hemorrhages, hypertension
d)soft exudate, central retinal vein occlusion","The given image shows small, discrete yellowish, waxy areas with crenated margins that are suggestive of hard exudates, seen in diabetes mellitus.
In diabetic retinopathy, hard exudates occur due to chronic localized edema and are composed of leaked lipoproteins and lipid-filled macrophages.



other common causes of hard exudates include hypertensive retinopathy, coats’ disease, and circinate retinopathy.


cotton wool spots (soft exudates) appear as whitish fluffy spots with indistinct margins that    represent areas of infarcts in nerve fiber layer. common causes are hypertensive retinopathy, toxemic retinopathy of pregnancy, diabetic retinopathy, anemias, and collagen disorders like  discoid lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, and scleroderma.
The image shows cotton wool spots


Flame-shaped hemorrhages are superficial retinal hemorrhages that occur due to disruption of the capillaries in the retinal nerve fiber layer. common causes are diabetic retinopathy,
non-ischemic central retinal vein occlusion, traumatic retinopathy, Eale's disease, hypertensive retinopathy, and anemic retinopathy.





Fundus examination of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) reveals massive engorgement,  congestion, and tortuosity of retinal veins. Ischemic CRVO has massive retinal hemorrhages giving a splashed tomato appearance involving the whole fundus.",3056-1864.PNG,B,3062-1872.PNG;3062-1871.PNG;2914-1752.PNG;3006-1830.PNG
Q3,A 33-year-old woman presents with complaints of progressive loss of vision in the right halves of both eyes. where is the lesion located in the optic pathway?,"a)Left optic tract
b)Right visual cortex
c)optic chiasma
d)Right optic nerve","The patient presenting with progressive visual loss in the right halves of both eyes is suggestive of right homonymous hemianopia. The site of the lesion in this case is the left optic tract.
Here, vision is lost in the right half of both eyes, which means:
• in the left eye, the nasal visual field is lost, and
• in the right eye, the temporal visual field is lost.



It means left temporal and right nasal fibers are destroyed which leads to right homonymous hemianopia. Anatomically, this can be explained by the fact that each optic tract contains
fibers from the ipsilateral temporal half of the retina and the contralateral nasal half of the retina.
optic tract lesions can occur due to pituitary adenomas (most common), craniopharyngioma, tumors of optic thalamus, large aneurysm of superior cerebellar or posterior cerebral
arteries, demyelinating diseases, and infarction.
other options:
option B - Lesion at right visual cortex causes left homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing.
option C - Lesion at optic chiasma causes bitemporal hemianopia.
option D - Lesion at the right optic nerve causes blindness in the right eye.",,A,3064-1874.PNG
Q4,A 2-month-old infant was brought by his mother with complaints of inability to open the eyes in light and excessive watering. The clinical picture is given below. what is the most probable diagnosis?,"a)ophthalmia neonatorum
b)congenital glaucoma
c)Mucopolysaccharidosis
d)cataract","The clinical history of inability to open eyes in light (photophobia), excessive watering, and the image showing hazy cornea are suggestive of congenital glaucoma.
Primary congenital glaucoma refers to abnormally high intraocular pressure (IoP) which occurs as a result of a developmental anomaly of the angle of the anterior chamber. It is not associated with any other ocular or systemic anomaly. It can be classified as follows:
• True congenital glaucoma: The IoP is elevated during intrauterine life.
• Infantile glaucoma: Manifests prior to age 3.
• Juvenile glaucoma: The IoP rises between 3 and 16 years of age. It is the least common type. The CyP1B1 gene is implicated in the pathogenesis of congenital glaucoma.
Clinical presentation: Lacrimation, photophobia, and blepharospasm form the classic triad
of symptoms of congenital glaucoma. A corneal haze is seen due to diffuse edema secondary to



raised IoP. Buphthalmos occur as a result of stretching due to elevated IoP prior to the age of 3 years. Haab striae that are curvilinear healed breaks in Descemet's membrane are seen. corneal scarring can also occur.
Evaluation under general anesthesia is generally required. IoP measurement, anterior chamber   examination, optic disc examination, corneal diameter measurement, gonioscopy, and refraction should be evaluated.
Management is essentially surgical with goniotomy or trabeculotomy. If angle surgery fails,
trabeculectomy, tube shunt implantation, and ciliary body ablative procedures are performed.
other options:
option A - In ophthalmia neonatorum, there will be inflammation of the conjunctiva. clinical
presentation includes conjunctival discharge, hyperemia chemosis, swollen eyelids, tender eyeball. corneal involvement is rare which may occur in the form of superficial punctate keratitis.
option c - In mucopolysaccharidosis, there will be bilateral cloudy cornea.
option D - In cataract, there will be opacification of lens presenting as whitish reflex/ leukocoria.",3057-1865.PNG,B,
Q5,A 15-year-old girl is not compliant with spectacles for her myopic astigmatism. what would be the appropriate management in her case?,"a)LASIK
b)Spherical equivalent spectacles
c)Femto LASIK
d)Implantable collamer lens","The appropriate management for myopic astigmatism in a 15-year-old girl (&lt;18 years) would be spherical equivalent spectacles.
Prescription in astigmatism has 3 components:
• Power of the spherical component: convex (+) or concave (-) in dioptre sphere (DS)
• Power of the cylinder: convex (+) or concave (-) dioptre cylinder (Dc)
• Axis or orientation of the cylinder
The cylinder power and axis are correcting the astigmatic part of the refractive error. If an
astigmatic eye were to be corrected with a spherical lens alone, the result would be a blur circle on the retina, called the circle of least confusion.
The spherical lens power places the circle of least confusion on the retina and is called the
spherical equivalent. It is defined as the spherical power whose focal point coincides with the    circle of least confusion, where one would see minimal blurring in their vision. To calculate the spherical equivalent, add half the cylinder power to the sphere power:
Spherical equivalent= spherical power + 1/2 (cylindrical power)
For example, for spherical power +2 and cylindrical power +3,
+2.oo +(+3.oo /2) = +3.5o.
Spherical equivalent spectacles are given if one has to give less cylinder power than was measured. other options:
options A and c - LASIK and Femto LASIK should be done in patients above 18 years of age.
option D - Implantable collamer lens is indicated for patients 21-45 years of age.

Q6,what is the most common complication associated with the following abnormality?,"a)Exposure keratopathy
b)Restricted eye movements
c)Diplopia
d)Amblyopia","The given image shows a coloboma of the upper eyelid. The most common complication associated with this condition is exposure keratopathy since the defect leaves the cornea exposed. If left untreated, it can lead to corneal ulceration.
coloboma of the eyelid is a partial or full-thickness eyelid defect. It usually occurs near the nasal side. It more frequently involves the upper lid than the lower lid. It occurs when eyelid
development is incomplete, due to failure of migration of lid ectoderm to fuse with the lid folds.
small defects can be managed by primary closure, while large defects require skin grafts and rotation flaps.
upper lid colobomas occur at the junction of the middle and inner thirds. It has a relatively strong association with cryptophthalmos, facial abnormalities, and Goldenhar
syndrome. cryptophthalmos is a congenital anomaly in which the eyelids are absent, replaced by a continuous layer of skin.
Lower lid colobomas occur at the junction of the middle and outer thirds and are frequently associated with systemic conditions.
Treacher collins syndrome (mandibulofacial dysostosis) is a genetically heterogeneous condition. It is characterized by mandibular and ear anomalies. lower eyelid coloboma, slanted palpebral
apertures, cataract, microphthalmos, and lacrimal atresia.",3058-1866.PNG,A,3067-1876.PNG
Q7,A 7-year-old boy presented with a white pupillary reflex for which enucleation was done. The histopathological examination of the specimen showed Flexner winterstein rosettes. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Retinoblastoma
b)Medulloblastoma
c)Rhabdomyosarcoma
d)Astrocytoma","The most likely diagnosis with a histopathological finding of Flexner winterstein rosettes in a
7-year-old child with a whitish pupillary reflex is retinoblastoma. Flexner winterstein rosettes
refer to an arrangement of columnar cells around a central lumen, which is highly characteristic of retinoblastoma.
Retinoblastoma is a malignant proliferation of immature retinal neural cells and is the most
common intraocular malignancy in children. It is associated with mutations in the RB1 gene at chromosome 13q14. It is a tumour of a group called small round blue cell tumours because the immature retinal neural cells are seen as small round cells with large nuclei.
white pupillary reflex or leukocoria is the most common presenting feature, followed by a squint which is usually convergent. Rarely, the child may present with nystagmus and defective vision.
Image showing leukocoria of left eye





Histopathology of the tumor shows small round cells with large nuclei. Microscopic features of a well-differentiated tumor include Flexner-wintersteiner rosettes (highly specific of
retinoblastoma), Homer-wright rosettes, pseudorosettes, and fleurettes formation. Areas of necrosis and calcification can also be seen.
The histopathological image of retinoblastoma is shown below.


Treatment typically involves chemotherapy plus focal therapy. The commonly used three-drug regimen is the CVE regimen consisting of Vincristine, Carboplatin, Etoposide. Focal therapy
includes cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation, thermotherapy, plaque radiotherapy, and external beam radiotherapy.
Enucleation is done when
• the tumor involves more than half of the retina
• the optic nerve is involved



• glaucoma is present and the anterior chamber is involved
In the stage of extraocular extension, the globe bursts through the sclera, usually near the limbus or near the optic disc. This is followed by rapid fungation and involvement of extraocular tissues  results in marked proptosis. Distant metastasis occurs through the lymphatic spread and the
direct extension by continuity to the optic nerve and brain.
other options:
option B - Medulloblastoma is a malignant embryonal tumor of childhood that occurs exclusively in the cerebellum. patients usually present with headaches, ataxia, and signs of brainstem
involvement.
Histologically, the tumor is very densely cellular. Individual tumor cells have scant cytoplasm
and elongated or crescent-shaped hyperchromatic nuclei. Tumor cells form Homer wright rosettes. They express neuronal markers such as synaptophysin.


option C - Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood. The child  usually presents with rapidly progressive unilateral proptosis. There are 4 subtypes - embryonal, alveolar, botyroid, and pleomorphic. Cells show light microscopic features of striated
muscle differentiation. Immunohistochemistry is positive for desmin.





Option D - Astrocytoma of the retina and optic nerve head is rare. It is usually asymptomatic and is most frequently seen in tuberous sclerosis. Fundus examination reveals a yellowish or white
plaque, nodule, or mulberry-like lesion. These lesions are semitransparent peripherally and calcified centrally.

Q8,An industrial worker was admitted to the hospital after an eye injury sustained while cutting   stone with a hammer and iron chisel. A foreign body was suspected to be impacted in his eye. which investigation can be detrimental to this patient?,"a)MRI
b)CT
c)X-ray
d)B mode scan","MRI can be detrimental for a patient with a history of an intraocular foreign body (IOFB) after cutting stone with a hammer and iron chisel. It can cause further damage by producing
movements of the foreign body if it is magnetic. The use of MRI is contraindicated for metallic (iron) foreign bodies and is not recommended as a screening procedure.



The foreign bodies most likely to penetrate and be retained in the eye are minute chips of iron or steel. while chipping stone with an iron chisel, the chip of the iron chisel is more likely to enter    the eye than the stone. A foreign body entering the eye may cause damage by:
• mechanical effects
• introduction of infection
• reacting with the intraocular tissues
Anteroposterior and lateral view X-rays are recommended for locating an IOFB as most foreign
bodies are radio-opaque. ultrasonographic localization can tell the position of even
non-radiopaque foreign bodies. CT scan is the best method of IOFB localization. MRI is contraindicated for metallic IOFB.
Management: A foreign body should always be removed unless:
• it is inert and probably sterile
• little damage has been done to vision
• the process of removal will destroy sight
siderosis bulbi refers to the ocular degenerative changes produced by an iron foreign body. It
usually occurs 2 months to 2 years after the injury. This condition is due to the electrolytic
dissociation of the metal by an intrinsic resting current in the eye which disseminates the metal, combining it with cellular proteins and cause atrophy.
Clinical features:
• Iris: first stained greenish and later turns reddish-brown, causing heterochromia iridis.
• pupil: iron deposition in sphincter leads to mydriasis.
• Lens: iron deposition in a radial fashion on the anterior capsule of the lens, leading to anterior capsular cataract.
• Retina: pigmentary retinopathy; followed by atrophy of the retina and retinal pigmentary epithelium.
• secondary open-angle Glaucoma: due to damage to the trabecular meshwork.",,A,
