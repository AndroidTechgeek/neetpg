Q1,A patient presents with renal calculus of &gt; 4 cm of the staghorn type. what is the best management?,"a)Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy
b)percutaneous nephrolithotomy
c)ureteroscopic removal
d)Retrorenal surgery","The best management for staghorn renal calculus of &gt;4 cm is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL).
The initial management of renal stones depends on the stone size and includes conservative
management, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL), and PCNL. PCNL is preferred for     stones &gt; 2cm in size and for staghorn calculi, while ESWL is used to treat renal stones of size o.6 to 1.5 cm. PCNL is indicated in
• Renal stones &gt;2 cm
• Staghorn calculus
• Failed shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) or retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for renal calculi
• Lower pole renal stones with anatomy that is unfavorable for ESWL
other options:
option C: ureteroscopic removal is attempted for failed SWLs or PCNLs, and is not the first choice in the surgical management of renal stones.



Option D: RIRS is a minimally invasive procedure similar to ureteroscopic removal, where the     kidney is accessed using a slim and flexible ureteroscope in a retrograde manner via the ureteric orifice. It is indicated for lower pole renal stones &lt; 2 cm.",,B,
Q2,You are doing an emergency laparotomy for a case of intestinal obstruction. which organ will you first visualize to know if this is a case of small bowel or large bowel obstruction?,"a)Ileum
b)caecum
c)Jejunum
d)sigmoid colon","The cecum is the first organ to be visualized to differentiate between the small and large bowel in cases of intestinal obstruction.
Distension of the cecum will confirm large bowel involvement. The identification of a collapsed distal segment of the large bowel and its sequential proximal assessment will lead to the
identification of the cause.",,B,
Q3,what is the best position for a conscious patient to be in during the insertion of a Ryle's tube?,"a)supine with neck flexion
b)supine with neck extension
c)sitting with neck flexion
d)sitting with neck extension","The best position for a conscious patient to be in during the insertion of Ryle's tube (RT) is sitting with neck flexion. The described position helps in directing the RT towards the esophagus and
also prevents it from coiling in the oropharynx or entering the trachea.
RT, also known as nasogastric (NG) tube, measures 12o-125 cm. It has 4 markings at 4ocm (cardia), 5ocm (body), 6ocm (pylorus), and 7o cm (duodenum) to indicate the approximate position after the placement.
Indications for NG tube:
• Feeding in patients with dysphagia, decreased appetite, or those who are nil per os (NPO) for medical or surgical reasons.
• Aspiration of gastric fluid
• Gastric decompression in cases of intestinal obstruction and paralytic ileus.
• zollinger-Ellison syndrome
• Bowel irrigation
The absolute contraindications for an NG tube are severe midface trauma, recent nasal surgery, and basilar skull fractures
Steps for the correct insertion of RT in an adult:
• Examination of the patient’s nostril for any anatomical abnormalities and then instillation with 1o ml of 1% lignocaine
• NEX method is used to measure the length of the RT:  Place the exit port of the tube at the tip of the nose. Extend the tube to the earlobe, and then to the xiphisternum.
• The patient is asked to sit upright with partial neck flexion. The tip of the Ryle’s tube is
lubricated and passed along the floor of the nasal passage until a resistance is felt(corresponds to nasopharynx)
• The patient is subsequently asked to swallow water to guide the tube through the esophagus into the stomach until the marked length (based on the NEX method).



• NG tube is finally taped to secure it in place.
Confirmation of the correct position is done by:
• Auscultation in the epigastric area while injecting a bolus of air
• X-ray chest to locate the lead markers
• Aspiration of contents and subsequently confirming gastric origin (pH &lt;6 indicates gastric placement)",,C,4693-2931.PNG
Q4,pick from the following the usual cause of thyroid storm in thyroidectomy:,"a)Rough handling of thyroid during surgery
b)Due to parathyroid gland
c)Inadequate patient preparation
d)Infections","The usual cause of thyroid storm in thyroidectomy is inadequate patient preparation before surgery. patient preparation pre-operatively involves ensuring a euthyroid state.
Rough handling of the thyroid in thyroidectomy does not cause a thyroid storm. Though a
significant amount of thyroglobulin is stored in the acinar cells, they are inactive unless converted to thyroxine (T3 and T4).",,C,
Q5,"which of the following colored cannula will you use to achieve maximum flow rate, in a patient who needs a large amount of fluids?","a)Grey
b)Green
c)Blue
d)Pink",Grey colored cannula is used to achieve maximum flow rate in a patient who needs a large amount of fluids.,,A,
Q6,"A patient who was admitted after a road traffic accident is put on mechanical ventilation. He opens his eyes on verbal command and moves all four limbs spontaneously. Calculate his
GCS.","a)Eyes-2, verbal-1, Motor-5
b)Eyes-2, verbal-NT, Motor-5
c)Eyes-3, verbal-1, Motor-6
d)Eyes-3, verbal-NT, Motor-6","The patients GCS is Eyes-3, verbal-NT, Motor-6.
It is calculated as follows:



• Eye opening: opening to verbal command - 3
• Verbal response: In the case of endotracheal intubation, the verbal response score is noted as NT (non-testable)
• Motor respone: Movement of all 4 limbs spontaneously - 6
Total GCS score is not recorded since one of the components is non-testable.",,D,
Q7,"A patient was brought to the casualty after a road traffic accident (RTA) with chest trauma.     He is conscious and speaks single words. He has a respiratory rate of 44 cycles per min and a BP of 9o/4o mmHg. There is a hyper-resonance on percussing the right side of his chest.
what will be your next, immediate step?","a)Intubate the patient
b)Insert needle in appropriate intercostal space
c)Start intravenous fluids urgently
d)Take a chest X-ray","The given clinical scenario of chest trauma with a hyper resonant note on the right side suggests  pneumothorax. Hemodynamic instability in this patient suggests tension pneumothorax and this is managed by immediate decompression by insertion of a needle in the appropriate place.
pneumothorax refers to the presence of excess air in the pleural space. Entrapment of air occurs by:
• primary spontaneous pneumothorax - Due to the spontaneous rupture of apical pleural blebs or cystic spaces immediately below the visceral pleura.
• Secondary pneumothorax - Due to the rupture of dilated cystic spaces in lung diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (CopD)
• Tension pneumothorax - Due to a one-way valve mechanism that directs airflow into the pleural space leading to a higher than atmospheric pressure environment. This leads to the affected lung  being unable to expand appropriately and leads to hemodynamic instability.
Tension pneumothorax is a surgical emergency and the excessive pressure has to be immediately relieved. A chest X-ray is not required before emergency decompression as it is a clinical
diagnosis, but an X-ray should be done following chest tube insertion (option D). Tension
pneumothorax is managed by immediate needle decompression in the 5th ICS (adults), followed by definitive management with a chest tube inserted in the same space.
other options:
option A: Intubation is performed when the patient is unresponsive post chest tube insertion.
option C: while IV fluids are a part of the resuscitation protocol, the management of tension pneumothorax takes higher precedence as the next immediate step.
Note: According to ATLS 1oth edition
• In adults, needle thoracostomy or needle decompression location is changed to the 5th ICS anterior to the midaxillary line from the 2nd ICS midclavicular line.
• In the pediatric age group, the needle thoracostomy location remains at the 2nd ICS midclavicular line.",,B,
Q8,which of the following is used for wound infection grading?,"a)ASA classification
b)SIRS criteria
c)Southampton grading
d)APACHE II score","Southampton wound grading system is used to score the severity of wound site infection.

• Grade o - Normal healing
• Grade I - Normal healing with different grades of erythema
• Grade II - Erythema with other signs of inflammation at different parts of the wound.
• Grade III - Clear or serosanguinous discharge at different sites
• Grade IV - Pus discharge
other options:
option A: American society of Anesthesiologists (AsA)  grading is used in pre-anesthetic checkups to assess a patient's physical health and fitness for anesthesia and surgery.
option B: systemic Inflammatory Response syndrome (sIRs) is a set of clinical criteria used to    identify and monitor critically ill patients with high-grade burns, severe trauma, and other major surgeries.
option D: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II)  is a scoring system used to assess the severity and predict the outcome of pancreatitis.",,C,
Q9,The most common mediastinal tumor is _______.,"a)Thymoma
b)Neurogenic
c)Lymphoma
d)Bronchial cyst","The most common mediastinal tumors in descending order of incidence are thymoma (25%), germ cell tumor (13%), lymphoma, mesenchymal, and thyroid.
The Masaoka classification and TNM staging are used in the staging of thymoma.
The most common mediastinal tumor in children is the neurogenic tumor.",,A,
Q10,"on the 5th postoperative day post CABG, the patient develops tachypnea and hypotension. what is the most probable cause?","a)Sepsis
b)Acute kidney failure
c)Acute respiratory failure
d)Acute cardiac failure","The clinical presentation oftachypnoea and hypotension in a post-op day 5 patient who
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) points towards lung collapse (atelectasis) - type 3 respiratory failure.
Atelectasis is the most common respiratory complication in a post-operative patient.
The factors predisposing to atelectasis are general anesthesia, upper abdominal surgery, and
thoracic surgery. They commonly present with tachypnoea and decreased oxygen saturation. on examination, the breath sounds are bronchial in nature and reduced in intensity.
Lung atelectasis can be reversed (within 24h-48h) with early mobilization, deep breathing (5 sequential breaths for 5s), incentive spirometry, and chest physiotherapy.
other postoperative systemic complications include:
• Pneumonia and myocardial infarction : First few days after surgery
• Venous thromboembolism, kidney failure, and urinary tract infection: Days 4 to 7
• superficial and deep surgical site infections: 2nd post-op week



other options:
option A: For a diagnosis of sepsis, SEpSIS 3 criteria needs to be satisfied:
• A documented infection
• An acute increase in &gt;2 SoFA points
option B: Acute kidney failure is defined as a decrease in urine output (&lt;o.5 mL/kg/h for 6-12h) and a rise in serum creatinine values ( &gt;1.5x baseline or &gt;o.3 mg/dL).
option D: Acute cardiac failure has features of hypotension and tachycardia, with peripheral signs of hypoperfusion characterized by cold clammy extremities.",,C,
Q11,The probable diagnosis based on the below clinical image of the breast is?,"a)paget's disease
b)Mondor's disease
c)zuska's disease
d)Tietze syndrome","The image shows a thrombosed subcutaneous cord attached to the skin of the breast which is the pathognomic feature of Mondor's Disease.
Mondor’s disease is the thrombophlebitis of the superficial veins of the breast and anterior chest wall. It may also occur in the arm or penis. on raising the arm, the skin over the chest gets
stretched and a narrow, shallow groove alongside the cord is seen. It is treated by restricting arm movements and usually subsides within a few months without recurrence, complications, or
deformity.
The differential diagnosis to be considered is lymphatic permeation from an occult carcinoma of the breast.
other options:
option A: paget’s disease is a type of ductal carcinoma in situ arising from the nipple and commonly presents as nipple erosion.
option B: zuska’s disease, also called recurrent periductal mastitis, is a condition of recurrent retroareolar infections and abscesses. Smoking has been implicated as a risk factor for this
condition. Managed symptomatically by antibiotics coupled with incision and drainage as necessary.
option D: Tietze’s syndrome refers to the benign inflammation of one or more costal cartilages.",4699-2932.PNG,B,
Q12,The most commonly involved artery in pseudoaneurysm formation:,"a)Aorta
b)Femoral artery
c)popliteal artery
d)None of the above","The most commonly involved artery in pseudoaneurysm is the femoral artery.
A true aneurysm involves all three vessel wall layers, while a pseudoaneurysm involves only the intimal and medial layers. pseudoaneurysms are most commonly iatrogenic due to repeated
arterial puncture for blood sampling or catheterization procedures which injure the arterial wall. The most commonly used artery in endovascular surgeries is the femoral artery, and hence, also  the most commonly involved in the formation of pseudo aneurysms.
Aneurysms are usually pulsatile on palpation and a systolic bruit can be heard on auscultation.



Doppler ultrasound reveals a bidirectional, 'to-and-fro' flow of blood which is known as the yin-yang sign.
Treatment options include endovascular stent insertion, ultrasound-guided thrombin injection, and surgical repair.


other options:
option A: Aortic aneurysm can be types - thoracic or abdominal. They are usually seen in heritable conditions like Marfan syndrome or vascular-type Ehlers-Danlos.
option C: The most common peripheral aneurysm is the popliteal aneurysm (8o% of the cases) followed by the femoral aneurysm.",,B,4715-2941.PNG
Q13,"A chronic alcoholic patient came to the emergency with pain in the epigastrium radiating to the back and recurrent vomiting. on examination, guarding was present in the upper
epigastrium. The erect chest X-ray was normal. what is the next step?","a)upper GI endoscopy
b)Alcohol breath test
c)serum lipase
d)CECT","The clinical scenario of the patient presenting with abdominal pain, recurrent vomiting, and   upper epigastric guarding in a chronic alcoholic is highly suggestive of acute pancreatitis. The normal erect chest X-ray indicates that there is no pneumoperitoneum (effectively ruling out   perforation). The next step is to send blood samples for serum lipase levels.
while contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen (option D) is the best investigation to rule out a case of acute pancreatitis, it is not the next step after an abdominal  X-ray.
Acute pancreatitis is often caused by gallstones (7o%) or alcoholism (25%). The cardinal symptom is acute-onset severe pain in the upper quadrant of the abdomen. The patient usually presents in    shock (hypotension and tachycardia) and tachypnoea. some may also present with signs of
bleeding into the fascial planes leading to discoloration of the sites involved:
• Cullen’s sign: Around the umbilicus
• Grey Turner’s sign: Flanks
• Fox sign: Inguinal region



• Bryant’s sign: Scrotum
The diagnosis is often clinical with a laboratory diagnosis of serum lipase preferred over serum
amylase. The severity of the acute pancreatitis is assessed using the Ranson and Glasgow scoring   system ( ≥3 at 48h of onset of pain ). APACHE, SoFA, SAPS, and MoDS can also be used to assess the severity of pancreatitis in intensive care (ICU) settings.
Pancreatitis is managed conservatively with initial nasogastric drainage followed by intravenous fluids, analgesia, and frequent monitoring of vital signs, urine output, and blood gases.
other options:
option A: Upper gastrointestinal intestinal (GI) endoscopy is performed by passing a flexible   endoscope and is the best method for examining the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. It doesn't help us diagnose pancreatitis.
option B: The alcohol breath test is used as a screening test to measure the concentration of alcohol in a person's breath, but doesn't help us diagnose pancreatitis.",,C,
Q14,The best way to manage the wound shown in the image is:,"a)cleaning and dressing
b)Debridement and dressing
c)cleaning and skin grafting
d)cleaning and use of allograft","The given image shows a superficial injury to the skin, an abrasion. Cleaning and dressing is the appropriate management of an abrasion.
wound cleaning is the removal of bacteria and particles to decrease the chances of infection. It includes the “TIME” acronym:
• T - Tissue : Assessment and debridement of non-viable tissue or foreign material
• I - Inflammation/Infection : Assess the etiology of each wound
• M - Moisture Balance : Assess the etiology of wound exudate
• E - Edge of the wound : Assess the edge and surrounding skin
wound irrigation or toilet is washing the wound with normal saline.
wound debridement is performed using a surgical blade or fine scissors to remove any
devitalized, nonviable tissue or any embedded foreign body (option B).
Skin grafting is required only in situations of wonuds with larger areas soft tissue loss (options C and D).",4700-2933.PNG,A,
Q15,Device shown in the image is used for which purpose?,"a)prevent viral infections
b)prevent transfusion related reactions
c)prevent infections
d)All of the above","The image shows a leukoreduction filter which is used for filtering out donor wBCs. This helps in reducing the incidence of transfusion-related reactions by removing wBC microaggregates. The     optimum time for performing leukoreduction is before the storage of blood.
Potential benefits include reduced risk of:
• Sensitization to HLA antigens (important for transplant patients &amp; preventing platelet refractoriness)



• Febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR)
• CMV transmission
Note: CMV also has an affinity for monocytes and macrophages (types of wBCs). Reduction in     wBCs is the cause for the decrease in CMV transmission (accidental benefit), and thus, the main purpose of a leukoreduction filter is not the prevention of CMV transmission (options A and C).
possible reduced risk of:
• Transfusion-associated graft versus host disease (TA- GVHD)
• Transfusion-related immuno-modulatory (TRIM) effects
• Transmitting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
other Methods of Leucodepletion are:
• Specific leucodepletion filters (Most Efficient)
• washing
• Freezing
• Buffy coat removal
• Micro-aggregate filtration
• Low leucocyte apheresis devices",4701-2934.PNG,B,
Q16,"In a child with a unilateral undescended testis, a diagnostic laparoscopy is performed which showed the blind-ending testicular vessels on the right side. what is the next best step?","a)Inguinal exploration
b)Abdominal exploration
c)scrotal exporation
d)No further exploration","In non-palpable testis cases, laparoscopically encountering blind-ending vas deferens and
testicular vessels prior to entering the internal ring is sufficient to diagnose a vanishing testis. In such cases, no further exploration is required.
Cryptorchidism is the failure of the descent of the intra-abdominal testes into the scrotal sac.  It is the most common congenital abnormality of the genitourinary tract. The descent of the testes
can arrest anywhere, and the most common site is the inguinal region.
phases of testicular descent:
• Transabdominal phase: Testes come to lie in the lower abdomen or pelvis, and this descent is regulated by Mullerian-inhibiting substances.
• Inguinoscrotal phase: Testes descend along the inguinal canal and reach the scrotal sac, and this phase of the descent is regulated by androgen-induced calcitonin gene-related peptide from the
genitofemoral nerve.
The exact pathogenesis remains unknown; however, deficiency in gonadotropins and
Mullerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) and increased expression of estradiol in the placenta are thought to play a role.
Cryptorchidism is histopathologically characterized by the following:
• Testicular atrophy: thickening of the basement membrane, arrested germ cell development, marked hyalinization



• Tubules showing sertoli cells but no spermatogenesis
• Increase in the interstitial Leydig cells
It is associated with testicular atrophy and dysfunction, which result in sterility. cryptorchid testes carry a 3–5-fold higher risk for testicular cancer (usually seminoma).",,D,
Q17,what is the surgical site infection rate expected in a patient with a clean-contaminated wound that is operated on after antibiotics prophylaxis?,"a)1-2%
b)3%
c)13-2o%
d)2o-3o%","The surgical site infection rate expected in a patient with a clean contaminated wound that is operated upon after antibiotics prophylaxis is 3%.
ssI rates relating to wound contamination with and without using antibiotic prophylaxis:

Type of surgery	Infection rate without prophy laxis (%)	Infection rate with prophylax is (%)

Q18,which of the following is not a component of qsoFA?,"a)Respiratory rate ≥22/min
b)systolic Bp ≤1oo mm Hg
c)Altered mental status
d)Bilateral pupillary reflex","qsoFA score (quicksoFA) is a bedside prompt that may identify patients with suspected infection who are at greater risk for a poor outcome outside the intensive care unit (IcU).
It uses three criteria, assigning one point each for
• Low blood pressure (sBP≤1oo mmHg),
• High respiratory rate (≥22 breaths per min)
• Altered mentation (Glasgow coma scale, &lt;15).
The score ranges from o to 3 points. The presence of 2 or more qsoFA points is a simple prompt to identify infected patients outside the IcU who are likely to develop sepsis.",,D,
Q19,which of the following does not classify as locally advanced breast cancer?,"a)Tumor more than 4 cm
b)Inflammatory breast cancer
c)chest wall involvement
d)skin involvement","A breast tumor of size &gt; 5 cm (not 4 cm) is classified as locally advanced breast carcinoma (LABc).



Invasive breast carcinoma is of 3 types:
• Early breast carcinoma (EBc) - TNM combination ofT1 to T2, No to N1, and Mo
• Locally advanced breast carcinoma (LABc) - T4NoMo, T3N1Mo, TanyN2-3Mo
• Advanced breast carcinoma (ABc) - TanyNanyM1
Locally advanced breast cancer (LABc) includes:
• Breast tumors more than 5 cm in diameter
• cancers that involve the skin or the underlying muscles of the chest (T4 of TNM staging)
• cancers that involve multiple local lymph nodes (axillary or sub clavicular)
• Inflammatory breast cancer - a rapidly growing type of cancer that makes the breast appear red and swollen",,A,
Q20,All of the following are features of sIRs except:,"a)Temperature &gt; 38 degrees celsius
b)Respiratory Rate &gt; 2o/minute and paco2 &lt;35 mmHg
c)pulse rate &gt; 9o/minute
d)wBc &gt; 12ooo/mm3 or &lt; 4ooo/mm3","Respiratory Rate &gt; 2o/minute or (Not and) paco2 &lt; 32 mmHg (Not &lt;35 mmHg) would be a feature of SIRS (Systemic inflammatory response syndrome).
Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is an exaggerated defense response of the body to a noxious stressor (infection, trauma, surgery, acute inflammation, ischemia, or reperfusion) to localize and then eliminate the endogenous or exogenous source of the insult.
SIRS is diagnosed when any two of the following are present:
• Hyperthermia (&gt;38 Degree celsius) or Hypothermia (&lt;36 Degree celsius)
• Tachypnoea (&gt;2o/min) or paco2 &lt; 32 mmHg

Q21,The most common neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas is,"a)Gastrinoma
b)somatostatinoma
c)Insulinoma
d)VIpoma","The most common neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas is insulinoma (4 per million).
Insulinoma is an insulin-producing tumor of the pancreas, with more than 9o% of them being
benign. It occurs in &gt;4o years in patients without MEN 1 syndrome and &lt;4o years in patients with MEN 1. It presents with symptoms of hypoglycemia such as weakness, headaches, sweating,   faintness, seizures, and altered behavior. These occur after fasting or exertion and improve after     glucose intake.
The investigation of choice for insulinoma is the determination of 72-hour fasting
glucose and serum insulin levels. c-peptide and proinsulin levels are also elevated.
Medical management includes:



• Frequent carbohydrate-rich meals
• somatostatin analogs like octreotide are effective in controlling symptoms due to excess insulin secretion. They should be used with caution as they can suppress counterregulatory hormones,    such as growth hormone (GH), glucagon, and catecholamines, and precipitously worsen
hypoglycemia.
• Diazoxide can be used in the initial management of insulinoma as it inhibits insulin release. Its side effects include sodium retention and nausea.
• Everolimus has been found to be highly effective in improving glycemic control in patients with insulinoma owing to its antitumor effect and induction of insulin resistance.
Enucleation and pancreatectomy are the definitive surgical management of insulinoma.
other options:
option A: Gastrinoma has an incidence of o.5 to 4 in a million.
options B &amp; D: somatostatinoma and vIpoma are much rarer than gastrinoma.",,C,
Q22,After parotidectomy patients complains of loss of sensation while shaving. which nerve is most likely affected?,"a)Auriculotemporal nerve
b)Great auricular nerve
c)Facial nerve
d)Mandibular nerve","After parotid surgery, the nerve involved in the loss of sensation while shaving is the great auricular nerve.
The great auricular nerve (GAN) originates from the second and third nerve roots of the cervical plexus (C2-C3). It supplies the skin over the lower pinna, pre-auricular region, and angle of the   mandible (image below). The main trunk passes over the sternocleidomastoid and into the
anterosuperior portion of the parotid glands and branches into the anterior and posterior GAN.   The anterior branch of GAN is often injured during parotid surgery during the initial elevation of the skin flap.
when GAN is injured, it can cause reduced sensations in the earlobe, pre-auricular skin, and the angle of the mandible that can interfere with habits such as shaving, wearing earrings, etc.




other options:
option A: The auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve (V3 of trigeminal)
supplies the posterior part of the temple, tragus, and adjoining auricle. It does not supply the area where a person is likely to shave. However, the injury to the auriculotemporal nerve resulting in     aberrant regeneration would result in Frey's Syndrome (gustatory sweating).
option C: Though the facial nerve is the most common nerve affected during parotidectomy, any damage would result in facial paralysis and not loss of sensation of the face.
option D: The mandibular nerve is a branch of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) that supplies the skin over the mandible, lower lip, and cheek. However, they are not injured during
parotidectomy.",,B,4720-2942.PNG
Q23,ABCDE rule applies for:,"a)Malignant melanoma
b)BCC
c)SCC
d)Actinic keratosis","ABCDE algorithm is used to diagnose melanoma.
It comprises of:
• Asymmetry
• Border irregularity
• Color variegation
• Diameter of more than 6 mm
• Evolution or change
Melanoma is a malignant tumor arising from melanocytes at the epidermal-dermal junction.
Though it represents only 4% of skin cancers, it accounts for 8o% of deaths (high mortality rate). It presents as a pigmented lesion that has enlarged, ulcerated, or bled.
Histopathological confirmation is the gold standard in the diagnosis of melanoma. It is divided into four main types: nodular melanoma (NM), superficial spreading melanoma (SSM), lentigo  maligna melanoma (LMM), and acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM).
The treatment consists of wide local excision of the tumor and follow-up to detect any local recurrence around the scar and excluding nodal spread.",,A,
Q24,Identify the following instrument?,"a)unipolar cautery
b)Bipolar cautery
c)Harmonic scalpel
d)Ligasure","The given instrument is a unipolar cautery/monopolar cautery.
other options:
option B: The bipolar cautery contains two tips, unlike unipolar cautery which has only one tip.
The current flows between these two tips and hence it does not need a return electrode, unlike the unipolar cautery.





option C: The harmonic scalpel (shown below) is a surgical instrument used to simultaneously cut and cauterize tissue. ultrasonic energy is used in Harmonic scalpel where ultrasonic energy is
converted to mechanical energy at the active blade.


option D: Ligasure vessel sealing system (shown below) is a bipolar apparatus for sealing vascular tissue. It applies a high coaptive pressure during the generation of tissue temperature under
1ooo°C, hydrogen cross-links are first ruptured and then renatured, resulting in a vascular seal that has high tensile strength.",4703-2935.PNG,A,4722-2944.PNG;4722-2943.PNG;4723-2945.PNG
Q25,Radical neck dissection spares which of the following structures?,"a)Digastric muscle
b)sternocleidomastoid muscle
c)spinal accessory nerve
d)Ipsilateral cervical lymph nodes","Digastric muscle is spared in radical neck dissection (RND). RND is used in the treatment of malignant lesions of the neck with local spread or metastasis.
In 19o5, Crile described RND where Level I-v LN, sternocleidomastoid (SCM), internal jugular vein (IJv), and XI cranial nerve (spinal accessory nerve) are removed.
In 1962, Suarez described modified RND (MRND) where Level I-v LNs are removed and the following are preserved:
• MRND I - XI cranial nerve
• MRND II -  XI cranial nerve and IJv
• MRND III - XI cranial nerve, IJv, and SCM
Note: RND with an additional LN/muscle/nerve is called extended RND.",,A,
Q26,A patient comes with active variceal bleeding. which of the following is not done?,"a)platelet transfusion
b)Arrange pRBC
c)IV Octreotide
d)urgent Endoscopy","platelet transfusion is not done in the case of active variceal bleeding unless coagulopathy is
confirmed as the cause. platelet transfusions are indicated only in patients with a platelet count of &lt;5o,ooo/microL  or in patients with evidence of microvascular bleeding.
variceal hemorrhage is a medical emergency. varices usually present with the acute
onset large-volume haematemesis, the lower esophagus being the most common site for variceal bleeding.
The sites for portosystemic anastomosis are:
• Left gastric vein to distal oesophageal veins: oesophageal and gastric variceal bleeding



• superior rectal veins to Middle and inferior rectal veins: hemorrhoids and rectal bleeding
• Left branch of the portal vein to periumbilical veins: caput-medusae
• The right branch of the portal vein to retroperitoneal veins draining into azygos, hemiazygos, lumbar, intercostal, and phrenic veins
• omental and colonic veins near hepatic and splenic ■exures to Retroperitoneal veins near hepatic and splenic ■exures
Medical management of variceal bleeding includes blood transfusion (option B) and drug therapy with somatostatin analogs like octreotide (option C). short-term antibiotics like ceftriaxone are      known to decrease bacterial infection and increase survival.
surgical measures are preferred if medical management fails. They include balloon tamponade, endoscopic banding (option D), transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIps),
portosystemic shunts, splenectomy, and gastric revascularization
Note: sugiura procedure is the non-shunt surgical management of refractory oesophageal variceal bleeding. It is a procedure of de-vascularizing the distal esophagus and stomach.",,A,4724-2946.PNG

b)Immediate exploration on symptomatic side only
c)Delayed exploration on both symptomatic and asymptomatic side
d)Delayed exploration on symptomatic side only","In a case of suspected testicular torsion, immediate exploration needs to be done on both the   symptomatic as well as the asymptomatic side. After the de-torsion, the adequacy of the blood flow has to be assessed by Doppler.
In testicular torsion, the blood supply to the testicle is compromised due to the twisting of the
spermatic cord within the tunica vaginalis, resulting in ischemia of the epididymis and the testis. The patient usually presents with acute onset pain and swelling of the scrotum. on examination, the cremasteric reflex is lost, and the scrotum looks asymmetrical.
prehn’s sign is used to differentiate epididymitis from testicular torsion. prehn’s sign is said to be positive when the pain gets relieved on lifting the testis, and it is seen in epididymo-orchitis.



At the time of surgical exploration, contralateral testes also must be explored and fixed to the dartos fascia in order to prevent possible torsion occurring in this testes.
More than 8o% of the testis can be salvaged if surgery is performed within 6 hours. If the testis is found to be necrosed on scrotal exploration, orchidectomy of the necrosed testis and orchidopexy  of the contralateral testis is done.",,A,
Q28,what is the instrument shown below that is used to create a pneumoperitoneum ?,"a)veress needle
b)salah's needle
c)Hasson Trocar
d)von Graefe needle","The given image showing a long, slender laparoscopic instrument is veress Needle. It is used in direct puncture laparoscopy to produce a pneumoperitoneum.
Direct puncture laparoscopy (closed method):
• The abdominal wall is grasped with towel clips or fingers to elevate the abdominal wall away from the underlying structures.
• A small incision is made in the umbilicus and the veress needle is introduced into the abdomen. Two distinct pops can be felt as the needle pierces the abdominal wall fascia and the peritoneum.
The umbilicus is the preferred location for introducing a vereess needle because the abdominal wall is thin at this location.
carbon dioxide (co2) gas is usually used and the maximum pressure is in the range of 14-15
mmHg. But N2o is used if the procedure is done under local anesthesia. Insufflation with N2o is stopped at a pressure of 1o mmHg or when 2L of gas is insufflated.


The Hasson Trocar is used to gain access to the peritoneal cavity and generate
pneumoperitoneum by the open direct peritoneal access technique (option c). This is known as the Hasson technique and is done only occasionally. It is preferred for patients who have
undergone previous abdominal surgeries as the small bowel may be adherent to the undersurface of the abdominal wound in such cases.





other options:
option B: salah's needle is a type of reusable bone marrow biopsy needle that has a guard situated 2 cm from the tip and a side screw.


option D: Von Graefe needle (also known as Graefe's knife) is primarily used in ophthalmic surgery.",4705-2937.PNG,A,4725-2947.PNG;4726-2949.PNG;4726-2948.PNG
Q29,which of the following is the principle behind the wound-healing procedure shown in the image below?,"a)Negative pressure wound therapy
b)positive pressure wound therapy
c)Foam therapy
d)sponge therapy","The given image shows negative pressure wound therapy using a vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) device to promote healing in chronic wounds.
principle: An intermittent negative pressure of -125 mmHg hastens debridement and formation of granulation tissue in chronic wounds.



Indications: chronic wounds (such as diabetic foot ulcers, stage III and IV pressure
ulcers), traumatic wounds, flaps and grafts, and dehisced incisions.
contraindications:
• Exposed vital structures (organs, blood vessels, or vascular grafts)
• preexisting infection
• Inadequate debridement of devitalized soft tissue or bone increases the risk of infection.
• The presence of malignancy (Marjolin’s ulcer).
• An allergic reaction towards the adhesive used to maintain the vacuum seal.
Though not an absolute contraindication, there is no appreciable benefit for ischemic wounds.",4705-2936.PNG,A,
Q30,stage the bedsore in the following image:,"a)4
b)3
c)2
d)1","The given image shows complete skin loss that involves muscles and shows exposed bone indicating a stage 4 pressure sore.
pressure sores are skin or soft tissue injuries that occur due to prolonged pressure over specific     areas of the body. An external pressure of &gt;3o mmHg leads to the formation of pressure sores. The common sites of pressure sores in decreasing frequency are the ischium, greater trochanter,   sacrum, heel, malleolus (lateral followed by medial), and occiput.
pressure sores can be prevented with good skincare, the use of air-fluidized beds, special
pressure-dispersion cushions, or foams. Repositioning the patient every two hours can lessen the pressure on the area.
ulcers of stages 1 and 2 often do not require operative measures. They are managed with regular wound cleaning and dressing with a good antibiotic cover.
Stage 3 and 4 ulcers are adequately debrided, and vacuum-assisted closure (VAc) is used to
promote the growth of granulation tissue required for surgical closure. Large skin flaps that have muscle with sensory innervation are best for reconstruction.",4706-2938.PNG,A,
Q31,A patient with a road traffic accident presented to the emergency room and requires a large amount of fluids to be transfused. which of the following IV cannula is preferred?,"a)Green
b)Blue
c)pink
d)Grey","Grey coloured IV cannula is required for this patient in order to transfuse large amount of fluids.
The ATLS 1oth edition guidelines state that 2 cannulae of atleast 18G should be used to gain    vascular access in trauma patients. In this scenario requiring large fluid transfusions, the grey (16G) cannula would be preferable to the green (18G) cannula due to the higher flow rate.",,D,
Q32,A patient with a nodule of the neck presents to the surgery OPD. A junior resident performs the following method to palpate it. Identify the procedure shown in the video below.,"a)Lahey's method
b)crile's method
c)kocher's method
d)Pemberton's method","The video depicts Lahey’s method of palpation of the left lobe of the thyroid gland.



In Lahey's method, for palpating the left lobe, the examiner initially pushes the right lobe medially with the left hand, and then using the right hand, the border and consistency of the left lobe is
palpated.
other options:
option B: In crile's method the patient is asked to swallow, while the examiner palpates the gland with the thumb. This gives a clear indication regarding the slight enlargement of the thyroid gland or small nodules.


option c: kocher's method is done to demonstrate the pressure effect of the thyroid gland on the trachea or larynx. Lateral compression will result in stridor.
option D: pemberton's sign (not method), is engorgement of neck veins when the patient is asked to raise their hands above the head and the arms should touch the ears. It is seen in patients with retrosternal goiter.",4707-2939.PNG,A,4728-2950.PNG
Q33,The instrument given in the image is:,"a)Hemovac
b)Jackson-pratt drain
c)Minivac
d)corrugated drain","The given image is of a Jackson-pratt drain.
Drains are placed at surgical sites to freely drain the air or fluids that may accumulate. They promote wound healing by preventing the formation of unnecessary cavities. Drains can be:
• open : They are based on the principle of gravity
• semi-open : Their action is based on capillary effect
• closed : They carry out their actions through suction
Jackson-pratt drain is a closed, air-tight drainage system that operates by self-suction. The drain is sutured in place on the skin at the site of insertion to promote stability. There are two main
parts to a Jp drain:
• Hollow tube



• collection bulb
The drain should be emptied as often as possible to allow the bulb to be compressed fully in order to maintain suction. This is usually done every 4-6 hours the first few days.


other options:
option A: Hemovac is also a closed type of suction drain which can typically handle larger amounts of fluid than the JP drain.
option c: Minivac is a closed wound drainage system under negative pressure used in minor surgeries.
option D: corrugated drain is an open drainage system to remove excess fluid from the operated site.",4708-2940.PNG,B,4729-2951.PNG
