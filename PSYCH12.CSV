"Q1","A schizophrenic patient was prescribed drug A after he did not respond to haloperidol and thioridazine. He now presents with excessive salivation, an increase in blood glucose, and  hyperlipidemia. what is drug A?","a)ziprasidone
b)Risperidone
c)clozapine
d)Aripiprazole","Drug A is clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic used in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. Excessive salivation, an increase in blood glucose, and hyperlipidemia are side effects of
clozapine.
The side effects of clozapine are



• Agranulocytosis
• weight gain
• Seizures
• Drooling
• Hyperthermia
• Hyperglycemia
• Hypertriglyceridemia
Clozapine causes the highest weight gain among all antipsychotics. Agranulocytosis is a dose-independent side effect and seizures are a dose-dependent side effect.
other options:
option A: ziprasidone - Although it is an atypical antipsychotic, it does not typically cause
excessive salivation, significant increases in blood glucose, or hyperlipidemia. The side effects of ziprasidone include orthostatic hypotension, QT prolongation, and minimal weight gain.
option B: Risperidone - Risperidone is another atypical antipsychotic, but its side effect profile differs from the symptoms presented in the question. Risperidone is more likely to cause
hyperprolactinemia, weight gain, sedation, dystonia, and parkinsonism features than the symptoms mentioned.
option D: Aripiprazole - It is an atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder, but its side effects are typically less severe than those of clozapine. Aripiprazole is more likely to cause nausea, anxiety, and insomnia than the symptoms described.","","C",""
"Q2","A woman, who is 4 days postpartum, presented with tearfulness, mood swings, and occasional insomnia. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)postpartum depression
b)postpartum blues
c)postpartum psychosis
d)postpartum anxiety","postpartum blues is the most likely diagnosis in a postpartum woman with tearfulness, mood swings, and insomnia from day 4.
postpartum blues, also known as baby blues, is a transient mood disorder characterized by
sadness, tearfulness, confusion, and dysphoria. There are no suicidal thoughts or thoughts of
harming the baby. These symptoms typically develop 3-5 days after delivery. They are thought to be due to hormonal changes, the stress of giving birth, and the responsibilities of motherhood.    They resolve spontaneously within 1o-14 days.
Management involves reassurance, education, and support. The patient must be followed up and assessed if symptoms persist for &gt;2 weeks to evaluate postpartum depression.
other options:
option A: when the symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, insomnia, and weight changes start within 4 weeks as per DSM 5 or 6 weeks as per ICD 11, and the symptoms persist for ≥ 2 weeks, the diagnosis will be postpartum depression. The patient may have occasional thoughts of
harming the baby and suicidal thoughts. It can persist for months to years when untreated.
option C: postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency that usually occurs within 4 weeks after delivery (DSM 5) or 6 weeks after delivery (ICD 11). The predominant symptoms are



hallucinations, delusions, suicidal thoughts, and thoughts of harming the baby. psychotic symptoms such as insomnia, restlessness, labile mood, and agitation are seen.
Lithium, antipsychotics, and an antidepressant is the treatment of choice.
option D: postpartum anxiety is not defined by DSM-5. However, some platforms might describe postpartum anxiety as excessive or severe worry after childbirth.
Note:  zuranolone is the first-ever oral drug to be approved specifically for the treatment of
postpartum depression. It is a neuroactive steroid that enhances the action of GABA in the brain and regulates mood.","","B",""
"Q3","A 25-year-old female reported symptoms of anxiety, palpitations, sweating, breathlessness, chest pain, and a feeling of impending doom. she recalls having experienced 5-6 similar
episodes in the past 6 months, each episode lasting for about 2o-3o minutes. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Depression
b)panic disorder
c)Generalized anxiety disorder
d)phobia","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of a panic disorder.  panic disorder refers to an acute
intense attack of anxiety accompanied by feelings of impending doom. Such attacks may not only occur in response to a fearful situation, or phobic objects, or in response to obsession or
separation as in other anxiety disorders.
panic disorder is characterized by the presence of an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense
discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes. During the episode, the person may experience
symptoms like palpitations, sweating, trembling or shaking, shortness of breath, nausea,
dizziness, chest pain or discomfort or fear of dying. The patient also might feel like losing control, having a heart attack, or going crazy.
There is a dysfunction in major neurotransmitter systems like norepinephrine, serotonin, and
GABA. panic-inducing substances or panicogens may induce such attacks and include substances  like 5-35% carbon dioxide, sodium lactate, bicarbonate, yohimbine (α blocker), flumazenil (GABA antagonist), cholecystokinin and caffeine.
It is not attributable to any drug abuse, medication, medical condition or mental disorder.
Treatment of this condition can be done by cognitive behavioral therapy and drugs like
benzodiazepines (alprazolam, lorazepam), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (paroxetine), tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.","","B",""
"Q4","A chronic alcoholic is brought to the emergency department with confusion, ataxia, and
painful eye movements. The 6th cranial nerve is also involved. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)wernicke's encephalopathy
b)korsakoff psychosis
c)Delirium tremens
d)De clerambault syndrome","The above clinical history is suggestive of wernicke's encephalopathy caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency.
wernicke’s encephalopathy is an acute, neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by nystagmus and ophthalmoplegia, mental status changes (confusion), and unsteadiness of stance and
gait (ataxia). It is a medical emergency, and thiamine should be initiated immediately, either
intravenously or intramuscularly. The current standard of treatment for patients with symptoms of wernicke's encephalopathy is to give thiamine 1oo mg intravenously before administering
glucose-containing IV fluids.
other options:



option B: korsakoff psychosis - while korsakoff psychosis is also associated with thiamine
deficiency and can occur along with wernicke's encephalopathy, it is primarily characterized by memory loss and confabulation. The presence of confusion, ataxia, and painful eye movements  with 6th cranial nerve involvement is more indicative of wernicke's encephalopathy.
option C: Delirium tremens - It is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and usually occurs within 3-4 days of alcohol withdrawal. The features of delirium tremens are
clouding of consciousness, disorientation to time and place, poor attention and distractibility,   visual hallucinations and illusions, tachycardia, fever, hypertension, diaphoresis, and pupillary dilatation, and psychomotor agitation and ataxia.
option D: De Clerembault syndrome (erotomania) - It is characterized by the delusional belief that someone is deeply in love with them. It is more common in women than in men, commonly a
young woman who believes that a man whom she considers to be of higher social and/or
professional class, is in love with her. This condition is not related to alcohol abuse and does not cause the neurological symptoms described in the question.","","A",""
"Q5","A middle-aged man complains of very early ejaculation during intercourse. what is the non-pharmacological management that can be advised to the patient?","a)cognitive behavioral therapy
b)Exposure and response prevention therapy
c)squeeze technique
d)sensate focus therapy","The clinical scenario of ejaculation very early on vaginal penetration is suggestive of premature ejaculation (PE), and the squeeze technique is a non-pharmacological management (behavioral method) used to prevent it.
PE is a disorder of the orgasm phase of the normal sexual cycle.
In premature ejaculation, there is a persistent or recurrent achievement of orgasm and ejaculation before the patient actually wishes to. According to DSM-5, it is classified as follows:
• Mild if ejaculation occurs within approximately 3o seconds to 1 minute of vaginal penetration • Moderate if ejaculation occurs within approximately 15 to 3o seconds of vaginal penetration
• Severe if ejaculation occurs at the start of sexual activity or within approximately 15 seconds of vaginal penetration.
Pharmacologic therapy when combined with behavioral treatment appears to be more effective in treating premature ejaculation.
The squeeze technique is a behavioral method used on the penis to prevent premature ejaculation. Here, the penis is stimulated until just before orgasm after which it is gently squeezed.
other options:
option A: Although Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be beneficial for some patients with    sexual dysfunction. It is not a specific technique for managing PE. Instead, CBT is more useful in addressing underlying psychological issues or relationship problems that may contribute to the     condition. CBT is used in the treatment of depression, phobia, anxiety and panic disorders, oCD, personality disorders, and somatoform disorders.
option B: Exposure and response prevention therapy is a strategy within CBT that is effective in    the management of oCD. It is also useful in other conditions like tics but is not a suitable method for managing premature ejaculation.



option D: sensate focus therapy is a couple-oriented sex therapy that involves the exchange of
sensual touch between partners to alleviate anxiety and negativity associated with sex and to build better sexual intimacy and communication. It does not specifically address the issue of premature  ejaculation like the squeeze technique does and is hence not useful.","","C",""
