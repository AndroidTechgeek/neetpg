Q1,which is not an obvious advantage of high pressure oxygen through nasal cannula:,"a)Decreases need of intubation
b)Reduces nasopharyngeal dead space
c)Heating and humidification
d)PEEP","High flow nasal cannula (HFNC), which delivers oxygen at high flow, and pressure through the nasal cannula.
Advantages of high-flow nasal cannula:
• Soft and pliable nasal prongs provide comfort to the patient.
• warming and humidification of secretions: The heating of air to core temperature and
humidification of the inspired air is better at high-flow. The humidification causes increased water content in the secretions, which facilitates the removal of secretions. It also decreases the work of  breathing and avoids airway dessication and epithelial injury.
• Reduces dead space: The high flow of the oxygen delivered clears the upper airway of the expired air, which reduces dead space by a decrease of rebreathing and allows a higher fraction of minute  ventilation to participate in alveolar gas exchange.



• Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP): HFNC increases the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and reduces the work of breathing.
• High flow rate causes decreased entrainment of room air, allowing more accurate delivery of oxygen.",,A,
Q2,Duration of action of Proparacaine:,"a)2 min
b)5 min
c)4o min
d)2o min","The duration of action of proparacaine is approximately 1o-2o minutes.
Proparacaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution is used as a topical anesthetic agent.
Indications: For procedures which require corneal anesthesia of short duration such as:
• Tonometry
• Gonioscopy
• Removal of corneal foreign bodies
• For short corneal and conjunctival procedures
Contraindication: Patients with known hypersensitivity",,D,
Q3,Glycopyrrolate is used as a pre-anesthetic agent for:,"a)Reducing the secretions
b)sedative effect
c)skeletal muscle relaxant
d)Anxiolytic","Glycopyrrolate is used as a pre-anesthetic agent for reducing the secretions.
Anticholinergic drugs e.g. atropine, glycopyrrolate are routinely administered with
anticholinesterases in order to attenuate the undesirable muscarinic effects. Glycopyrrolate is
usually preferred because it has less vagolytic effects than atropine at doses that inhibit secretions and does not cross the blood-brain barrier. It should be administered as early as possible to
maximize its effectiveness.
Glycopyrrolate o.2 mg IV, is administered to dry airway secretions before flexible scope
intubation of the trachea, during the bronchoscopic examination.",,A,
Q4,Identify the device shown in the image below.,"a)Automated External Desynchonizer
b)Automated External Defibrillator
c)Automated Electronic Defibrillator
d)Automated External decompressor","The device is an Automated External Defibrillator (AED).
This is a special medical device that is commonly used for recognizing the absence/presence of rapid ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. with no need for intervention by an
operator, it determines whether an electrical shock right to the heart must be performed (defibrillation).
An automated external defibrillator can be used on those victims, who are unconscious and aren’t breathing in a normal way. As a rule, it is used together with CPR in cases of sudden cardiac
arrest. It is forbidden to use it on patients who are less than eight years old or those weighing less than 25 kgs.",3416-2138.PNG,B,
Q5,"You are an intern posted in the ICU. while taking a blood sample for ABG, which of the following steps would you not do?","a)Normal ph can't rule out acid base disorder
b)Add o.5 ml Heparin to the syringe before taking blood
c)If modified Allens test is negative, alternate site is chosen
d)Radial artery is the preferred site","o.5 ml of Heparin is not added to the syringe before taking blood.
very little heparin is needed in the sample to prevent clotting; o.o5 to o.1o ml of a dilute
solution will help prevent coagulation of 1 ml of blood without affecting its pH. This is achieved by drawing o.5 ml into the syringe and flushing it out. The residue that remains adherent to the
syringe is sufficient for the procedure.
Heparin must be added to the syringe as an anticoagulant. Because the pH of heparin is near 7.o, and the Po2 and Pco2 of the heparin solution are near room air values, excess heparin can alter    ABG measurements. After flushing the syringe with heparin, a sufficient amount usually remains  in the dead space of the syringe and needle for anticoagulation without distortion of the ABG
determination.
Note:
• Modified Allen's test positive indicates that the collateral blood flow is normal
• Modified Allen's test negative indicates that the collateral blood flow is abnormal and an alternate site must be chosen.",,B,3419-2139.PNG
Q6,which of the following is not a risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications?,"a)BMI &gt; 3o
b)well controlled asthma
c)Upper abdominal surgery
d)Age &gt; 7o years","well-controlled asthma is not a risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications. Risk factors for postoperative pulmonary complications:
• Age &gt;7o years
• COPD (uncontrolled)
• Neck, upper abdominal, Aortic, neurologic surgical procedures



• prolonged procedure &gt;2 hours
• General anesthesia with intubation
• BMI &gt; 3o
• Albumin concentration &lt; 35 g/L
• Inability to walk two blocks on level land or one flight of stairs",,B,
