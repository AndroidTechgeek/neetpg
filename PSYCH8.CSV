"Q1","A person often feels that his hands are contaminated and he is forced to wash his hands.    Recently, he feels this repetitive, distressing thought of repetitive hand washing has begun affecting his performance. which of the following is the best treatment option for this
patient?","a)DBT
b)Exposure and response prevention
c)systematic desensitization
d)CBT","A patient presenting with an obsession with contamination and repetitive handwashing is
suggestive of classical obsessive-compulsive disorder (OcD) and the best treatment option for this patient is exposure and response prevention (ERp).
First line management of OcD in adults can include pharmacotherapy or
psychotherapy. psychotherapy is primarily based on exposure and response prevention.
Exposure and response prevention is a form of exposure therapy that is included under behavioral therapy. It is a more specific treatment modality for OcD than cBT. It refers to exposing the
patient to OcD-inducing situations and preventing them from exhibiting the usual compulsive responses. The level of exposure and control of response to it, is gradual and is decided by the  therapist and the patient. The dose and duration of exposure and response prevention therapy should be sufficient for it to be effective.
cognitive therapies aim to address distortions in thought like increased responsibility to clean hands by replacing them with adaptive thinking patterns.
pharmacotherapy consists of SSRIs and clomipramine. pharmacotherapy is preferred in patients with severe symptoms or with co-morbid depression.
combined therapy with pharmacotherapy+ psychotherapy are effective in patients not responding to either of them alone.
Somatic therapies like targeted neurosurgical lesions to cortico-striatal-thalamic cortical tracts (cSpc) and deep brain stimulation have proven efficacious in treatment-refractory patients.
cognitive behavioral therapy (Option D) with ERp for OcD is preferred in children and
adolescents. cognitive-Behavioral therapy comprises of a number of treatment patterns that
include both cognitive and behavioral interventions. cognitive therapy aims to correct
maladaptive beliefs and behavioral therapy facilitates better functioning by reducing symptoms. Broadly, it is used to treat depression, generalized anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress

Treatment of nicotine addiction
1. Behavioral therapy- Elimination of the factors that favor smoking in the patient's environment, skill training, etc.
2. pharmacotherapy used in the treatment of nicotine addiction are:
• Nicotine replacement therapy- It is used to reduce the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal without the use of tobacco. It is given for the initial maintenance period followed by a reduction period
both lasting for about 6-12 weeks. It is available in various forms like
• Nicotine gum- It releases nicotine by chewing and buccal absorption. smokers can use 1-2 gums per hour and a maximum of 24 gums per day. Acidic beverages like coffee, tea, soda, and juice
should not be used during gum use because they decrease absorption.  poor compliance is a drawback.
• Nicotine lozenges- This is especially useful for people who smoke immediately after awakening.
users must suck the lozenges until it is completely dissolved and must not swallow it. It provides the highest level of nicotine compared to other nicotine replacement therapies.
• Nicotine patches- It provides continuous delivery of nicotine and is available as 16 or 24-hour tapering preparations. It has good compliance.
• Nicotine nasal spray- provides nicotine concentration in the blood similar to smoking. Major adverse effects are rhinitis, watering eyes, and coughing
• Nicotine inhaler - Even though it was designed to deliver the nicotine to the lungs, the actual absorption occurs in the upper throat.
• Non-nicotine medications
• Bupropion is an antidepressant medication. It has dopaminergic and adrenergic actions.
• varenicline is a partial agonist of alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic receptor. It blocks nicotine from
binding to the receptor and decreases the rewarding aspects of cigarette smoking. At the same   time, it also stimulates the receptor and reduces withdrawal and cravings. There were concerns about its neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular side effects, but according to recent studies
varenicline is considered a safe drug.
• Nortriptyline - second-line drug
• clonidine- It decreases the sympathetic activity from locus ceruleus and is useful in controlling the withdrawal symptoms.
Nicotine addiction:
It acts on the nicotinic subtype of acetylcholine receptors. Its addictive properties are thought to be due to the activation of the dopaminergic pathway in the ventral tegmental area. It causes
improved attention, problem-solving ability, learning, and lifts the mood of the users.

c)Depression is a common comorbidity
d)Contamination is uncommon obsession","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is commonly associated with depression. The lifetime
prevalence of the major depressive disorder in patients with OCD is 67 percent. Other common
psychiatric comorbidities in patients with OCD are social phobia, alcohol use disorders, panic, and personality disorders.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) comprises symptoms that include intrusive thoughts, preoccupations, and compulsions. These recurrent obsessions or compulsions cause severe  distress to the patient. The patient might have an obsession, a compulsion, or both.

They repeatedly wash their hands or avoid touching objects which are thought to be contaminated. In extreme cases, patients may rub the skin off their hands due to    excessive hand washing or may refuse to leave the house in fear of germs.
• pathological doubt - This is the second most common symptom pattern. The patient presents
with an obsession with doubt and a compulsion to check. This obsession arises due to possible
danger or violence (e.g., forgetting to turn off the stove or not locking a door) which is followed by multiple trips to check, for example, if the stove is turned off, if the door is locked, etc.

intrusive obsessional thoughts without compulsion. These thoughts could be sexual or an
aggressive act that the patient doesn't agree. The patients might report themselves to the police or confess to a spiritual leader.

• pharmacotherapy: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or clomipramine
• Behavioral therapy: Approaches include:
• exposure and response prevention
• desensitization
• thought stopping
• flooding
• implosion therapy
• aversive conditioning
A combination of behavioral and pharmacotherapy is most effective.

"Q7","which of the following is true statement about korsakoff syndrome?","a)Triad of confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia
b)Loss of long term memory but intact personality
c)Anterograde amnesia with loss of recent memory
d)Loss of implicit memory and immediate recall","In korsakoff's psychosis, there is anterograde amnesia with loss of recent memory.
korsakoff's syndrome is a chronic amnestic syndrome that can follow wernicke's syndrome. It is   caused by thiamine deficiency that is associated with chronic alcohol abuse. The typical feature of this disease is anterograde amnesia with loss of recent memory in an alert and responsive
patient. patients with korsakoff's syndrome also typically have a change in personality, with a lack of initiative, reduced spontaneity, and a lack of interest.
The treatment is with 1oo mg of thiamine orally for 3-12 months. Despite adequate treatment and nutritional support, very few of the patients fully recover. with treatment, patients may remain
amnestic for up to 3 months, and then improve gradually during the next year.
prolonged use of alcohol causes alcohol-induced persisting amnestic disorder with loss of
short-term memory. when the symptoms are acute, it is called wernicke's encephalopathy and when chronic, it leads to korsakoff's syndrome. These conditions are caused due to thiamine     deficiency and when they occur together, they are called wernicke-korsakoff syndrome.



other options
option A -Triad of confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia is seen in wernicke's
encephalopathy. There may also be vestibular dysfunction. wernicke's encephalopathy is
completely reversible. The treatment is parenteral administration of 1oo mg thiamine for 1-2 weeks.
option B - personality is affected in korsakoff's syndrome. Recent memory is affected more compared to long-term memory.
option D - Implicit memory refers to memory that does not require conscious recollection.
Implicit aspects of memory are preserved, however, some studies conclude that implicit memory may be intact or impaired depending on the specific task parameters.","","C",""
