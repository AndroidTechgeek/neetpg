"Q2","Gastric lavage can be performed in case of poisoning by:","a)Sulphuric acid
b)Strychnine
c)Carbolic acid
d)kerosene oil","Gastric lavage can be performed in case of carbolic poisoning.
In carbolic acid poisoning, if the patient survives for 48 hrs, there will be carboluria followed by anuria. The victim will pass dark, smoky urine which soon turns olive green on standing due to  oxidation of hydroquinone and pyrocatechol.
It is a corrosive acid, however, it hardens the GI mucosa producing a leather bottle stomach and anesthetizes the nerve endings. This allows for gastric lavage.
contraindications of gastric lavage:
• corrosives poisoning (except carbolic acid)
• convulsants/cNS stimulants
• comatose patients
• volatile poison
• upper GI pathology (eg. esophageal varices)
• Hypothermic patient
• Severe heart disease



• Advanced pregnancy
Sulphuric acid and kerosene are corrosives and strychnine is a convulsant. Hence gastric lavage is not done in these poisonings.","","C",""

"Q5","which of the following statements is true about battered baby syndrome?","a)skin lesions and bruises of various ages are seen on the body
b)It occurs due to the tendency of a child to fall repeatedly
c)Multiple stab wounds are seen
d)The syndrome is a result of firearm injuries","Skin lesions and bruises of various ages are a classical feature of a child with battered baby syndrome.
A battered child is one who has received repetitive physical injuries as a result of
non-accidental violence, produced by a parent or guardian, there may also be deprivation of nutrition, care, and affection.
The syndrome must be considered in any child:
• In whom the degree and type of injury varies with the history given
• when injuries are of different ages and in different stages of healing
• when there is a purposeful delay in seeking medical attention despite serious injury



• who exhibits evidence of fracture of any bone, subdural hematoma, failure to thrive, soft tissue swelling or skin bruising
• who dies suddenly
skeletal survey, which includes the following, should be done in a case of suspected child abuse:
• Ap views of the entire skeleton
• Dedicated views of hands and feet
• Lateral views of appendicular skeleton, skull and spine","","A",""
"Q6","which of the following tests is based on the principle that prior knowledge of the events/activity will influence the suspect’s reaction?","a)Truth serum
b)polygraph
c)Brain Mapping
d)Hypnosis","Brain Mapping is based on the principle that if the suspect has prior knowledge of the
event/activity being described it will reflect in the suspect’s brain wave responses.
It is a technique that measures recognition of familiar stimuli by measuring electrical brain wave responses(p3oo) to words, phrases, or pictures that are presented on a computer screen.
Truth serum : This is based on the principle, that at a point very close to unconsciousness, the subject will be mentally incapable of resisting questioning and will be incapable of lying.
polygraph : It is based on the theory, that when a person lies in the answer to a question, if he/she experiences fear, the emotion of fear will result in certain physiological changes.
The physiological changes are commonly observed are :
• Relative rise in blood pressure
• pulse rate increases
• slowing down of breathing/erratic breathing
• suppression of involuntary muscular movements
• Increased activity of sweat glands","","C",""
"Q7","In alleged history of gunshot injury, there is burning, blackening, tattooing around the wound. The injury is:","a)close shot entry wound
b)close shot exit wound
c)Distant shot entry wound
d)Distant shot exit wound","Based on the ballistics, the gunshot injury is close shot entry wound.
• The main objective of study of a firearm wound (Ballistics) is to establish the range and direction of firing, the ultimate purpose is to determine the weapon used for firing.
• Firearm wounds are fundamentally of two mains types: wounds of entry and wound of exit. The  wound of entry is the wound through which the bullet or pellets enter the body, and the wound of exit is the wound through which the bullet emerges out of the body.
• To determine the Range of firing, following parameters are used:
• Entry wound size and shape
• Blast effect – Muzzle end imprint and edge eversion



• Blackening, Tattooing, singeing of hair, Abrasion collar and Grease collar
• In the above options, Hair should be preserved in order to determine the range of firing which can be examined for carbonisation/dessication in close range, also from lead deposition around  the wound to assess range of firing.

"Q10","which of the following acts as a physiological antidote to scorpion venom?","a)physostigmine
b)Norepinephrine
c)prazosin
d)Atropine","prazosin acts as a physiological antidote for scorpion venom.
The venom is a clear, colorless, proteinous toxalbumen, having a hemolytic and neurotoxic effect. Its toxicity is more than that of snakes, but only a small quantity is injected. The venom is a
potent autonomic stimulator, resulting in the release of massive amounts of catecholamines from the adrenals.
If the scorpion has hemolytic venom, the reaction is mainly local and simulates the viper snake    bite. The scorpion sting will have only one hole in the center of the reddened area. The extremity will have edema, pain, and reddening. This usually lasts for one to two hours.
The symptoms produced by a neurotoxic venom are similar to a cobra bite. There is usually no     marked reaction in the local area. Nausea, vomiting, extreme restlessness, fever, various types of paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, convulsions, coma, respiratory depression, and death may occur   within hours from pulmonary edema or cardiac failure.
prazosin can counteract the alpha-adrenergic effects of autonomic stimulation, such as
hypertension.","","C",""
