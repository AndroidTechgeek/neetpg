Q1,"A 42-year-old man had a fall followed by one episode of vomiting. when brought to the
casualty, he was awake and conscious but had unrelieved anterograde amnesia. which of the following is the most likely cause?","a)Drunkenness
b)Diffuse axonal injury
c)concussion
d)cerebral venous thrombosis","The given history of fall and anterograde amnesia points towards the diagnosis of concussion.
A concussion is the most common type of traumatic brain injury. It can result from vehicle
accidents, falls, sports injuries, etc. Anterograde amnesia/post-traumatic amnesia is the hallmark of a concussion. In this type of amnesia, the events following the injury cannot be recalled.
other clinical features of concussion include headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting.
option A: Drunkenness - the patient will be drowsy or sleepy and not awake.
option B: Diffuse axonal injury - seen in high-speed deceleration which causes disruption and    shearing of axons leading to microhemorrhages. usually results in a persistent vegetative stage.
option D: cerebral venous thrombosis - acute thrombosis in dural venous sinuses; manifests as headache, visual abnormalities, or seizures.",,C,

The three zones in the given image represent EoG, EEG and EMG, respectively.





The following table helps identify the state of wakefulness from the graph : In the marked area,
• EOG shows positive activity
• EEG shows Mixed waves
• EMG shows Minimal activity
This is characteristic of REM sleep.

Q3,which of the following is the test for immediate memory?,"a)Digit span forward up to 7 digits with 2 skips allowed
b)serial (1oo-7) subtraction test up to 5 steps
c)Digit span backwards up to 5 digits with 2 skips allowed
d)serial (2o-1) subtraction test up to 5 steps","Forward digit span test is the best test among the given options.
Memory is of 3 types:
• Immediate
• Recent
• Remote
Immediate memory is attention dependent. Tests of attention and memory include
• Digit span test: Most important and best test for immediate memory
• serial (1oo-7) subtraction test is the best for concentration
• Days of the week backwards
• spell WORLD backwards
• (2o–3) test
Digit span test
The examiner recites numbers randomly without any sequence and asks the patient to repeat the same. The examiner starts with a 2-number sequence and the digit span increases from 2
numbers to 3 numbers and so on. The patient is asked to repeat until he/she fails to repeat all numbers correctly.
Digit forward
• Normally a person can repeat up to 7 digits (+/- 2)
• E.g., Examiner says 2 - 4 –8 –1 –5 –7 - 9. The person has to repeat in the same order 2 – 4 – 8 –1 –5 –7 –9.
Digit backward



• Reproduction of longer digits in backward direction.
• Normally a person can repeat up to 5 digits (+/- 1) in backward direction (making option c wrong)
• Eg : Examiner says 2 - 4 –8 –1 –5 –7 - 9. The person has to repeat it backwards. 9 -7 -5 -1 -8- 4- 2.
serial (1oo-7) subtraction test
• 5 scores / steps are taken in to account
• 1st score – when the patient tells 93 (1oo - 7 = 93)
• 2nd score - when the patient tells 86 (93 – 7 = 86)
• And so on . . 1oo , 93 , 86 , 79 , 72 , 65
Hence among the given options :
Digit span forward up to 7 digits with 2 skips allowed would be the answer of choice as it is the best test for immediate memory",,A,
Q4,A patient believes he is the most important person in the world and so his neighbours and family members are trying to harm him as they are jealous of him.

b)Fregoli syndrome
c)Delusion of subjective doubles
d)othello syndrome","According to the given scenario,

capgras syndrome



The delusion in capgras syndrome is the belief that a familiar person has been replaced by an imposter
Fregoli’s phenomenon
