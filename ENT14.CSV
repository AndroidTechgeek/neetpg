Q1,All of the following are features of otitis media with effusion EXcEPT?,"a)Most cases have Ad type of curve on tympanometry and a conductive hearing loss
b)Resolves on its own after the symptoms subside
c)usually occurs after an episode of common cold, but can occur de-novo
d)It is usually bilateral","Type B tympanometry curve is obtained in otitis media with effusion.
serous otitis media also known as secretory otitis media, mucoid otitis media, or glue ear is characterized by the accumulation of nonpurulent, serous effusion in the middle ear cleft.
Glue ear can occur either due to eustachian tube dysfunction (adenoid hyperplasia, chronic sinusitis or tonsillitis or rhinitis, cleft palate, tumors of nasopharynx) or due to increased
secretory activity of the middle ear mucosa (allergy, unresolved otitis media, viral infections).
Glue ear is commonly seen in children aged 5-8 years and is associated with insidious onset of hearing loss (not exceeding 4o dB), mild ear aches, and a history of upper respiratory tract
infections. Delayed or defective speech may also result from hearing loss.
otoscopy shows:
• Dull and opaque tympanic membrane with loss of light reflex
• Thin leash of vessels along the handle of the malleus
• Fluid levels and air bubbles can be seen when the tympanic membrane is transparent. The otoscopy image of serous otitis media is shown below:





Treatment is mainly aimed at the removal of fluid and preventing recurrence.
• Medical management includes decongestants, antihistamines, and antibiotics.
• surgical management is done if the condition cannot be controlled with medications.
It includes myringotomy and aspiration of fluid with grommet insertion. Adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy may be required and are usually done at the time of myringotomy.
Hearing tests suggestive of conductive hearing loss as seen in serous otitis media:
• Rinne negative (BC&gt;AC).
• weber - lateralized towards the worse ear
• Audiogram - AC abnormal, BC normal, air-bone gap present
• Impedance audiometry - flat curve (reduced compliance, shift to the negative side) B-type tympanogram is expected in a case of serous otitis media.
Here, compliance decreases. The fluid accumulation causes decreased mobility of the tympanic membrane leading to a flat or dome-shaped curve, this results in a B-type tympanogram, as
shown below:





Note: Tympanograph is Flat when there is Fluid in the middle ear.",,A,3371-2107.PNG;3372-2108.PNG
Q2,which of the following is typically not seen in allergic rhinitis?,"a)Allergic shiners
b)Allergic salute
c)otto veraguth folds
d)Dennie-Morgan line","otto veraguth folds are not seen in allergic rhinitis.
otto veraguth fold is a physical sign of depression wherein there is a triangular fold in the nasal corner of upper eyelid.
Allergic rhinitis is an IgE-mediated immunological response of the nasal mucosa to allergens in the environment.
patients typically present with recurrent bouts of sneezing, nasal obstruction, watery nasal discharge, and itching.
clinical signs include:
• Allergic shiners: dark circles around the eyes.
• Allergic salute: black transverse nasal crease on the dorsum of the nose due to repeated upward rubbing.
• Dennie-Morgan lines - transverse skin creases in the infraorbital area.
Allergic rhinitis can be classified into intermittent and persistent, based on the duration of the disease:
• Intermittent- symptoms are present for less than 4 days a week, or less than 4 weeks
• persistent- symptoms are present for more than 4 days a week, or more than 4 weeks It can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on the severity of the disease:
• Mild- None of the following symptoms are present- sleep impairment, impairment of daily activities, school, or work, troublesome symptoms.
• Moderate- severe: If at least one of the symptoms mentioned above are present.



A step-care approach is recommended for allergic rhinitis and its impact on asthma (ARIA) for the treatment of allergic rhinitis includes the following:
• oral antihistamines or intranasal cromolyn sodium are recommended for mild, intermittent disease. (option A).
• Intranasal corticosteroids are used for moderate disease as monotherapy. (option B).
• oral antihistamines and intranasal steroids can be used in combination to treat severe diseases. (option C).
• A short course of oral corticosteroids and immunotherapy can be used for severe, persistent disease in case the above intervention fails
In the given image, otto veraguth's sign or veraguth's fold is shown, a diagonal palpebral fold
running from the lateral corners of the eyes, medially upward to the medial end of the eyebrows. It is a physical sign of depression.
Another physical sign of depression is the omega sign. In this, there is vertical wrinkling between the eyebrows joined at the top by a horizontal crease.",,C,3373-2109.PNG
Q3,A 13 year old male patient presents with unilateral nasal obstruction and recurrent episodes of epistaxis for past 6 months. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Antrochoanal polyp
b)Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma
c)coagulation disorder
d)Allergic rhinitis","The most likely diagnosis is juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA), as there is unilateral nasal obstruction and recurrent epistaxis.
Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is a highly vascular and locally aggressive tumor
seen almost exclusively in adolescent males, associated with significant morbidity and occasional mortality.
patients usually present with:
• Epistaxis (most common presentation): profuse, recurrent, and spontaneous
• Mass: A mass may be present in either the postnasal space, resulting in progressive nasal obstruction, or nasopharynx, where it may obstruct both choanae. The mass is firm in



consistency, but digital palpation of the same should not be done. If the mass obstructs the eustachian tube, conductive hearing loss and otitis media with effusion may be observed.
• proptosis, swelling of the cheeks, broadening of nasal bridge, and involvement of 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th cranial nerves may occur
JNA can be diagnosed using CT, MRI, and carotid angiography.
Anterior bowing of the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus due to the presence of a mass in the   pterygomaxillary space is a characteristic CT finding of JNA. This is known as the Holman-Miller sign or antral sign.
Recurrence has been reported up to 35%. surgical excision is the treatment of choice. Recurrent angiofibroma is treated with revision surgery or radiotherapy when the tumor is inaccessible.",,B,
Q4,which of the following is not recommended in an 8 yr old child with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss?,"a)Adenoidectomy and grommet insertion
b)cochlear implant
c)Hearing aid
d)sitting in front row of the class","Adenoidectomy and grommet insertion is not recommended in bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (sNHL).
Adenoidectomy and grommet insertion is done in the management of serous otitis media.
serous otitis media is also known as secretory otitis media or mucoid otitis media or glue ear. It is characterized by the accumulation of nonpurulent effusion in the middle ear cleft.
Treatment is mainly aimed at the removal of fluid and preventing recurrence.
• Medical management includes decongestants, antihistamines, antibiotics, and middle ear aeration techniques.
• surgical management includes myringotomy and aspiration of fluid, grommet insertion,
tympanotomy, or cortical mastoidectomy. Adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy may be required and are usually done at the time of myringotomy.
option B: Cochlear implant is an electronic device which helps in hearing for those with profound sensorineural hearing loss, who cannot benefit from hearing aids. It has two components :
• External component : speech processor and transmitter
• Internal component : receiver / stimulator and electrode array





Sound signals received by the processor is then conducted to the stimulator via the transmitter. It is then decoded and sent to the electrode array which is placed over the scala tympani. Scala
tympani then transmits the signal to the spiral ganglion, which in turn stimulates the auditory nerve cells. Thus, sound is conducted to the brain.
Option c: Hearing aids are used in the management of SNHL. Hearing aids are of the following types
• conventional hearing aids
• Bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs)
• Implantable hearing aids (vibrant soundbridge)
Option D: Sitting in the front row of class is recommended in SNHL to help the child hear the class better.",,A,3375-2110.PNG
Q5,"A young male patient presents to ER with complaints of daytime somnolence and repeated awakening at night from sleep and his partner gives history of snoring in bed. All of the
following are true except?","a)Apnea results in awakening
b)Apnea is due to fall in oxygen saturation
c)Low oxygen stimulates respiratory effort
d)pharngeal muscle tone increases","pharyngeal muscle tone decreases during snoring.
pharyngeal muscles are relaxed during sleep and cause partial obstruction. Breathing against
obstruction causes vibrations of soft palate, tonsillar pillars and base of tongue producing sound.
Types of snoring:
• primary snoring: without association with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). primary snoring is not associated with excessive daytime sleepiness and has apnea—hypnoea index of less than five.
• complicated snoring: associated with OSA.
Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is diagnosed if the patient has either
symptoms of nocturnal breathing disturbances or daytime sleepiness, and ≥5 episodes of
obstructive apnea or hypopnea per hour of sleep. Each such episode should last for at least 1o
seconds, resulting in ≥3% drop in oxygen saturation or a brain cortical arousal. OSA is diagnosed



by overnight polysomnogram (psG).
osAHs is characterized by recurrent episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation
usually, there is a decline in neuromuscular output to pharyngeal dilator muscles during sleep. In predisposed individuals, this results in complete (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) pharyngeal
collapse.",,D,
Q6,Identify the procedure.,"a)stapedotomy
b)Myringoplasty
c)Tympanoplasty
d)ossiculoplasty","The above image shows a stapedotomy procedure performed in the middle ear.
It can be identified as a stapedotomy procedure by the following features in the image given:
• The footplate of the stapes is not removed
• The prosthesis is placed by creating a hole in the footplate of the stapes
stapedotomy is the excision of the superstructure of stapes and drilling a hole in the footplate
&amp; placing a piston in the hole. It is done to bypass the immobile stapes using a piston which will take over the function of conducting sound.


contraindications for stapedotomy:
• only hearing ear
• positive schwartze sign
• otitis external
• Meniere’s disease: can damage the inner ear while drilling a hole in the footplate
• young children
• professional athletes, pilots, construction workers, and divers: sudden changes in pressure can displace the piston and cause vertigo.



• Those who work in noisy surroundings: surgery makes them more vulnerable to noise-induced hearing loss.
otosclerosis is a primary disease of the bony labyrinth where foci of irregularly placed spongy
bone replace part of the normally dense enchondral layer of the bony otic capsule. otosclerosis commonly involves the stapes, causing stapes fixation and conductive hearing loss. clinically,
patients present with painless progressive bilateral conductive hearing loss and paracusis willisii (patients hear better in noisy surroundings as other people raise their voices to be heard). pure    tone audiometry would reveal conductive hearing loss with a dip in bone conduction at 2ooo Hz (carhart’s notch). The definitive treatment for otosclerosis involves stapedectomy, in which the    otosclerotic stapes is removed, and a prosthesis is placed in its place.
The image shown below shows carhart's notch.


other options
option A: Myringoplasty is the term given for the closure of perforation of pars tensa of the tympanic membrane. It is done to check repeated infections from the external ear.
option B: Tympanoplasty is the surgical reconstruction to correct damage in the middle ear and restore the integrity of the tympanic membrane. It involves ossiculoplasty (ossicular chain
reconstruction) with or without myringoplasty.
option c: ossiculoplasty eradicates the disease from the middle ear and reconstruction of hearing.",3376-2111.PNG,A,3376-2111.PNG;3377-2112.PNG
Q7,what is the most commonly used test in screening for neonatal hearing?,"a)conduction audiometry
b)Otoacoustic emissions (OAE)
c)Brainstem evoked response audiometry
d)clap and smile","otoacoustic emissions (oAE) are used in the universal neonatal hearing screening protocol.
In India, a two-stage screening protocol is followed according to which infants are screened first    with otoacoustic emissions (oAE). Infants who fail the oAE are screened with auditory brainstem response (ABR) or Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry (BERA), which is also the definitive    test. All babies kept in NIcU must be screened by BERA test as per the protocol.



The first screening is usually conducted at birth or before discharge. Conducting the first
screening before discharge is preferred to ensure better coverage and reduce loss to follow-up. A  second screening is scheduled anytime between 1–3 weeks or during the next scheduled visit at 6 weeks.
All babies with abnormal BERA should undergo detailed ENT evaluation and hearing-aid fitting (cochlear implants) and auditory rehabilitation must be done before 6 months of age.
other options
option A: Conduction audiometry is used in older children and adults to measure hearing thresholds, requiring active cooperation, which is not feasible in neonates.
option C: Brainstem evoked response audiometry (BERA): while BERA is more precise and can detect auditory pathway issues up to the brainstem, it is more time-consuming and costly. It is    typically used for confirmation if oAE results are abnormal.
option D: Clap and smile is an outdated, subjective test and is not reliable for neonatal hearing screening.",,B,
Q8,Identify the type of hearing loss.,"a)Mixed hearing loss
b)conductive hearing loss
c)sensory hearing loss
d)Normal","The given audiogram is suggestive of left-sided mixed hearing loss.
Interpretation of the audiogram:
• Blue colour indicates the left ear.
• &gt; indicates bone conduction (BC), and the threshold is &gt;25 dB. Hence, BC is abnormal, which implies that the abnormality is in the sensorineural pathway.
• × indicates air conduction (AC), and the threshold is &gt;15 dB. Hence, AC is abnormal.
• Both AC and BC are abnormal. It indicates sensorineural hearing loss.
• In addition, the air-bone gap is present, which implies conductive hearing loss.
• Hence, the interpretation is left-mixed hearing loss.
A mixed type of hearing loss presents with defects in both conductive and sensorineural pathways. This type of hearing loss is seen in chronic suppurative otitis media and otosclerosis.",3367-2104.PNG,A,
Q9,The posterior end of the marked structure is present at the level of which of the following?,"a)Eustachian tube
b)sphenopalatine foramen
c)odontoid process
d)sphenoidal sinus","The marked structure shown is the inferior turbinate. The posterior end of the inferior turbinate is present at the level of the opening of the eustachian tube.
The eustachian tube connects the nasopharynx and the tympanic cavity in the middle ear. It is
usually collapsed and opens during activities such as yawning or swallowing. Its function is to
maintain the pressure in the middle ear cavity and drain any secretions from the middle ear. It
opens approximately 1.25 cm behind the posterior end of the inferior turbinate, in the lateral wall of the nasopharynx.



The inferior turbinate is the largest turbinate located in the lower part of the lateral nasal wall. The woodruff’s plexus is located inferior to the posterior end of the inferior turbinate and is
responsible for posterior epistaxis in adults.


other options:
option B: sphenopalatine foramen is situated at the posterior end of the middle turbinate.


option C: odontoid process is a protuberance of the Axis (C2 vertebra). part of the axis is located much lower in the neck and not associated with the nasal cavity.
option D: sphenoidal sinus opens into the nasal cavity at the superior meatus.",3368-2105.PNG,A,3379-2114.PNG;3379-2113.PNG
Q10,Carhart's notch is seen in _______,"a)otosclerosis
b)Noise-induced hearing loss
c)Meniere's disease
d)serous otitis media","carhart's notch is seen in otosclerosis. carhart's notch is a dip at 2ooo Hz in Bone conduction, seen in pure tone audiometry.


pure Tone Audiometry in otosclerosis:
• Air conduction is poor &amp; worse for lower frequencies.
• Large A-B gap
• Bone conduction is normal.
• In some cases, there is a dip in the bone conduction curve.
• It is different at different frequencies but is maximum at 2ooo Hz and is called carhart’s notch.
Note: Boiler’s notch is a similar dip in the Bc and Ac curve but at 4ooo Hz, as seen in noise-induced hearing loss.",,A,3377-2112.PNG;3380-2115.PNG
Q11,which of the following is the most dangerous lesion?,"a)U/L Partial RLN lesion
b)B/L Partial RLN lesion
c)U/L Complete RLN lesion
d)B/L Complete RLN lesion","Bilateral complete RLN (recurrent laryngeal nerve) lesion is the most dangerous lesion among the given options.
In bilateral RLN paralysis
• Both the cords lie in the median or paramedian position, the airway is inadequate causing dyspnea and stridor. This may lead to death if untreated.
• The voice is good.
• Dyspnea and stridor become worse on exertion or during an attack of acute laryngitis.
All laryngeal muscles are supplied by the ipsilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), except   cricothyroid which is supplied by the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN). Both SLN and RLN are
branches of the vagus nerve.
The recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLN) on the right and the left side follow different courses-    • Right RLN takes origin in the root of the neck, winds around the first part of the subclavian artery, and then ascends in the tracheoesophageal groove.
• Left RLN takes origin in the thorax, winds around the arch of the aorta, and then ascends in the tracheoesophageal groove. Since it has a longer course, it is more likely to be injured.",,D,
Q12,Identify the nasal fracture.,"a)chevallet fracture
b)Jarjaway fracture
c)simple fracture
d)Le fort fracture","A Chevallet fracture usually results from a blow to the nose from below. This fracture line
runs vertically. It extends from the anterior nasal spine upwards to the junction of the bony and cartilaginous dorsum of the nose.
Injuries to the nasal septum can result from trauma to the nose from the front, side, or below. The septum may get buckled on itself, fracture vertically and horizontally, or get crushed
A Jarjaway fracture (option B) results from a blow to the nose from the front. The fracture line     runs horizontally backwards. It begins just above the anterior nasal spine and extends just above the junction of the septal cartilage with the vomer.





Early recognition and treatment of septal injuries are crucial, including drainage of hematomas.
Dislocated or fractured septal fragments should be repositioned and supported between
mucoperichondrial flaps using mattress sutures and nasal packing. Nasal pyramid fractures often coincide with septal fractures and should be treated simultaneously.
Neglecting injuries to the septum can lead to deviations in the cartilaginous nose, as well as asymmetry in the nasal tip, columella, or nostrils.
other options:
option C: simple fractures refer to the fractures of the nasal bone without displacement. simple fracture describes the nature of the fracture.
option D: Le Fort fractures are a group of fractures that affect the midface of the skull and collectively involve a partial or complete separation of the midface from the skull.",3369-2106.PNG,A,3245-2006.PNG
Q13,what causes maximum hearing loss?,"a)Malleus-incus discontinuity with intact tympanic membrane
b)Malleus-incus discontinuity with perforation of tympanic membrane
c)partial fixation of the footplate of stapes
d)otitis media with effusion","Malleus-incus discontinuity with an intact tympanic membrane causes maximum hearing loss.
This condition causes maximum conductive hearing loss, up to 6o dB,  as there is no alternative pathway for sound transmission to the cochlea. Even though the tympanic membrane is intact,   the disconnection of the ossicular chain severely disrupts sound transmission to the inner ear.
Hearing loss severity depends on the extent to which the normal transmission of sound waves through the middle ear is disrupted.
Average hearing losses seen in different lesions of conductive apparatus
• Complete obstruction of the ear canal: 3o dB
• perforation of tympanic membrane: 1o-4o dB
• ossicular interruption with intact drum: 54 dB



• ossicular interruption with perforation: 38 dB
• Malleus fixation: 1o-25 dB
• Closure of oval window: 6o dB other options
option B: Malleus-incus discontinuity with perforation of the tympanic membrane: Although this results in conductive hearing loss (38-4o dB), the perforated tympanic membrane allows some
direct transmission of sound to the inner ear, slightly reducing the severity compared to an intact tympanic membrane with ossicular discontinuity.
option C: partial fixation of the footplate of stapes causes a milder form of conductive hearing loss compared to ossicular discontinuity, typically around 3o–4o dB because some sound transmission still occurs through the fixed stapes.
option D: otitis media with effusion leads to mild to moderate conductive hearing loss (2o–3o dB), as fluid in the middle ear dampens sound vibrations but does not fully block sound
transmission.",,A,
