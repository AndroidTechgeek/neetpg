Q1,Identify the instrument.,"a)Episiotomy scissors
b)curved artery
c)curve-bladed Mayo
d)Mosquito forceps","The given instrument is Episiotomy scissors.
The episiotommy scissors is angulated to prevent extensions of the perineal tears into the anal margins and anal spinchters and it also prevents complete perineal tears.
Episiotomy is a planned incision made on the posterior vaginal wall and the perineum during the second stage of labor. It is done mostly to avoid spontaneous perineal injuries to the muscles and fascia at the time of delivery.
The ideal time to perform episiotomy is when the perineum is bulged thin during contraction, just prior to crowning. The most commonly performed episiotomy incision is mediolateral, which
prevents any rectal involvement even if the tear extends posteriorly. other types of episiotomy include: Median,lateral and J shaped.
Curved Mayo (option C)  is used to cut thicker tissues.
Mosquito forceps (option D)  is used to grasp the delicate tissues &amp; blood vessels.
The table below explains major differences between median and mediolateral type of episiotomy.

Midline Episiotomy	Mediolateral Episiotomy

Q2,"At term pregnancy, the normal amniotic fluid appearance is __________.","a)clear with white specks
b)cloudy without white specks
c)clear without white specks
d)cloudy with white specks","At term, the amniotic fluid is cloudy and contains a large number of white flakes of vernix.
Amniotic fluid appearance is determined by the proportion of cloudiness and the number offlakes released from the fetal skin over the period of pregnancy. This is summated by the amniotic fluid   macroscore.
At the end of the 32 nd week of pregnancy, the amniotic fluid is clear and does not have any flakes (option C). By the 36 th week, the amniotic fluid starts to have some flakes (option A) and
gradually we will begin to see traces of cloudiness also. By 42 nd week.i.e. term of pregnancy, the amniotic fluid has a large number of flakes and is very cloudy (option D).",,D,
Q3,Identify this condition.,"a)Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome
b)Monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy
c)Monochorionic monoamniotic pregnancy
d)Dichorionic diamniotic pregnancy","The given specimen depicts a monochorionic monoamniotic pregnancy as:
• 2 umbilical cords are arising from 1 placenta (monochorionic)
• No intervening amniotic membrane is attached to the placenta. This means that both fetuses must have been inside a single amniotic cavity (monoamniotic).
option B: In Monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy, on gross examination, there will be 1 placenta and intervening 2 layers of amnion attached to the placenta. In this type of pregnancy, each fetus  will have its own amniotic cavity (diamniotic) with a shared placenta (monochorionic). This is
seen if the fertilized zygote divides into 2 between 4-8 days.
The below given gross image of monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy shows two umbilical cords    arising separately from the placenta with the intervening amniotic membrane held by the forceps.


option D: In dichorionic diamniotic pregnancy each fetus has it’s own amnion &amp; chorion. The placentas here may be fused or separate. This is seen in dizygotic twins as well as
monozygotic twins that divide within o-4 days.
option A: Twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS)  most commonly complicates
monochorionic (single placenta) twin pregnancy. In TTTS blood is transfused from the donor twin to the recipient twin through the abnormal vascular connections within the placenta leaving the
donor anemic while the recipient becomes polycythemic.
The box below describes the type of amnion and chorion seen in different types oftwins depending on the time of division.

Q4,A lady with 7 weeks amenorrhea presented with slight vaginal spotting. Crown Rump Length  was 5 mm with a well-formed gestational sac with a calculated gestational age of 5.6 weeks on TVS. what is the next line of management?,"a)wait and watch for 4 weeks
b)Repeat TVS after one week
c)Serum HCG levels
d)Medical intervention","The given clinical scenario of a patient with amenorrhea presenting with spotting, raises   a suspicion of possible abortion and in the given case the next line of management would be to repeat TVS after one week.
In a normal intrauterine pregnancy a gestational sac will be visible on TVS by 5 weeks of LMP and the embryonic poles can be visualized by 5.5 weeks. The cardiac activity of the embryo can be first visualized on TVS around 5.5-6 weeks, when the crown rump length (CRL) is around 5mm.
In the event that, the embryonic poles are not visible on TVS, even when the gestational sac diameter has reached ≥25mm or the cardiac activity is not visualized even
at CRL ≥7mm a diagnosis of missed abortion can be made. The values, mean sac (gestational sac) diameter ≥25mm and CRL ≥7mm are known as critical cut off values which represent the upper    limit beyond which if a structure is not visualized, it is abnormal.
Hence, Missed Abortion should be suspected if, on USG
• CRL ≥7 mm and no heart beat is recorded (CRL-crown rump length)
• MSD ≥25 mm and no embryo is seen (MSD-mean sac diameter)
In this patient the CRL is still at 5 mm and hence, a diagnosis of missed abortion cannot be made. Thus, the next line of management would be to repeat TVS after one week.

b)Menorrhagia
c)previous ectopic pregnancy
d)previous history of abortion","An unmotivated patient or someone who does not consent to the procedure should never be taken up for a procedure.
contraindications for use of copper intrauterine devices (IUDs)
• Uterine abnormality with a distorted uterine cavity
• Active uterine and pelvic infection
• known or suspected uterine or cervical malignancy
• Genital bleeding of unknown etiology
• Mucopurulent cervicitis

Q6,"A 76 year-old female presented with a non-healing ulcer on the labia majora for a period of 6  months, measuring 2 cm x 3 cm. No lymph nodes were palpable. Biopsy shows squamous cell carcinoma. How do you manage this case?","a)Total vulvectomy with unilateral LN dissection
b)partial vulvectomy with ipsilateral inguinofemoral LN dissection
c)simple vulvectomy
d)chemoradiation with resection","According to the recent FIGO guidelines,the patient’s lesion measuring 2 cm x 3 cm with no
palpable lymph nodes falls under stage Ib vulval cancer and it's management is partial vulvectomy with ipsilateral inguinofemoral lymph node dissection.
For stage IB cancers, radical partial vulvectomy is recommended for the primary tumor and as the women with stage IB cancer can have diseased lymph nodes even without palpable enlargement of nodes, Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) and/ inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy is performed. Ipsilateral dissection of lymph nodes is performed if the vulvar lesion is present laterally, &gt;2cm beyond the midline. In cases where the vulvar lesion lies within 2 cm from the midline, bilateral     inguinofemoral Lymph Node dissection will be performed.
In this patient, the best management would be to perform partial vulvectomy with ipsilateral inguinofemoral LN dissection among the given options.",,B,
Q7,"A female comes to Gynecology OpD for pre-conceptual counseling, with 2 prior second trimester abortions. what is the next investigation you will advise?","a)pelvic sonography
b)Hysterosalpingography
c)Endometrial Biopsy
d)karyotyping of the parents","The most common cause of second trimester abortions are uterocervical structural anomalies and the next investigaton advised in this patient would be pelvic sonography to look for these
anomalies.
Although, Hysterosalpingography (option B) can be used in the patient during the
interconceptional period to diagnose internal anatomical abnormalities of the uterus and cervix, it is an invasive procedure and hence is reserved for use only after nonivasive procedures such as
sonography is done. Hysterosalpingography (HSG) has limited use in diagnosing the external uterine contour and it is contraindicated in pregnancy.
pelvic sonography is a non-invasive investigation that can be used to detect certain anatomical anomalies leading to abortions. A 3D sonography will provide better images of uterine and
cervical contour than a 2D sonography. This investigation can also be done in pregnant female.
karyotyping (option D) is done to rule out any suspicion of chromosomal abnormalities which, more commonly cause first trimester abortions.
NoTE: If a suspicion of cervical incompetence (H/o 1 painless second trimester loss) is present, a TVS is performed in a pregnant female between 18-24weeks and the cervical length and the
cervical shape is determined.
• Normal cervical length-3-4cm ; In cervical incompetence ≤2.5cm
• Normal cervix shape-Tshape; In cervical incompetence U shape
In the presence of ≥ 2 painless second trimester abortions, a history based diagnosis of cervical incompetence is made and the pregnant female can undergo prophylactic cervical cerclage with progesterone supplementation.

Q8,A pregnant female with known cardiac disease presents in the first trimester with history of warfarin embryopathy. what should be advised now?,"a)continue warfarin throughout the pregnancy
b)Replace warfarin with heparin in first trimester
c)Give acicoumarin
d)use LMw heparin","In the first trimester, warfarin has to be replaced with heparin due to its potential teratogenic effects such as miscarriage, stillbirths, achondroplasia and stippled epiphyses.
Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) must replace warfarin and shouldn’t be added along with the warfarin (option D).
The detailed guideline for anticoagulation in pregnancy is as follows:



• LMWH: low molecular weight heparin
• EDD: expected date of delivery
• UFH: unfractionated heparin
• PPH: postpartum hemorrhage

b)change the fluid to normal saline
c)continue the surgery with careful monitoring of fluid status
d)Give furosemide to the patient and continue surgery","This is a young patient with no comorbidities, subjected to an electrolyte poor fluid for irrigation. since the deficit is 5oo mL, it is recommended to continue the surgery with careful monitoring of fluid status.
The criteria for terminating the procedure for
• Electrolyte deficient fluid is—- a deficit of 1 L
• Electrolyte rich fluid is—-- a deficit of 2.5 L

Q11,"A 2o year old girl presents with primary amenorrhea. on examination breasts were found to be poorly developed, vagina was present. ultrasound revealed normal uterus but gonads
weren’t detected. Further evaluation done showed 46xy karyotype. The most probable diagnosis?","a)Androgen insensitivity syndrome
b)Turner syndrome
c)True hermaphrodite
d)swyer's syndrome","The given clinical scenario of a 46 Xy individual with female internal &amp; external genitalia and poorly developed breasts, presenting with primary amenorrhea points towards the diagnosis of
sweyer’s syndrome.
Turner syndrome (option B) is a disorder of 45 Xo individuals with short stature. The gonads in these individuals are streak ovaries.
Androgen Insensitivity syndrome (option A) is a disorder of 46 Xy individuals with complete insensitivity to testosterone. These individuals have female external genitalia with an absent   uterus. secondary sexual characteristics like the development of breasts are adequate.
However,pubic and axillary hairs are scanty.
True hermaphrodite (option c) can be a 46 XX or 46 Xy individual with both ovaries and testis.    These individuals have both male and female internal genitalia with ambiguous external genitalia.
sweyer’s syndrome is a type of male pseudohermaphroditism where there is an inactivation of the sRy gene that leads to formation of dysgenetic testis.
Thus,in the absence of hormones; AMH &amp; testosterone the mullerian duct grows and the wolffian duct regresses forming female internal genitalia such as uterus (infantile type).
These patients also lack the DHT hormone and hence present with poorly developed breasts (     tanner staging 1 or 2), scanty pubic,axillary hair and female external genitalia. These individuals are of normal stature with increased LH &amp; FsH.
Management includes gonadectomy as soon as diagnosed and estrogen + progesterone for breast development.

Q16,"A G3P2Lo presents with 9 weeks of amenorrhea. she has a history of conization being done one year ago and is currently on follow-up, with no recurrence on PAP smear. she also has   the history of preterm labor at 3o and 32 weeks. what is the next step of management?","a)UsG to see cervical length
b)cervical cerclage
c)complete Bed rest
d)Abdominal cerclage","The next step of management in this patient, is to do USG to measure the cervical length.
In the given clinical scenario the patient has undergone conization which is a risk factor for
cervical incompetence. Hence, it is important to measure the cervical length to diagnose cervical incompetence in this patient. If the cervical length is ≤2.5 cm then a cervical cerclage can be
performed.
cervical cerclage (option B) is performed as the next step in management when the patient
presents with ≥2 second trimester pregnancy losses (History based diagnosis of cervical
incompetence). Since, the history in this patient is of preterm labour, the first step would still be



to do a TVS to measure the cervical length for diagnosing. cerclage only comes after diagnosis.
cervical incompetence is one of the important causes second trimester (mid trimester) abortions. Risk factors for the incompetence include:
• past h/o surgery on cervix such as conization, loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEp)
• cervical trauma during labour, instrumental delivery
Diagnosis of cervical incompetence in a pregnant female:
• H/o ≥2 second trimester abortions (history based diagnosis)→ management is by cervical cerclege+progesterone
• H/o 1 second trimester abortion→ TVS done between 18-24 weeks to measure the cervical
length→USG based diagnosis of cervical incompetence is made if there is h/o 1 or more second trimester abortions with TVS showing cervical length ≤2.5 cm.

Q18,"A patient has been on MALA-N for 6 months. she is compliant, but she complained of missed periods. what is the next step?","a)Transvaginal ultrasound
b)Reassure her that it’s normal to have delayed period
c)Beta HcG estimation
d)serum FsH and LH","In the event of missed periods while on contraceptives, Beta-HCG estimation should be done as the next step to rule out pregnancy.
serum beta HCG can detect a pregnancy as early as 5 days before the first missed period. This can be done by either serum beta hcg estimation or by urine pregnancy test which estimates the
beta-hcg excreted in urine. If the patient is not pregnant she can continue taking the combined pill.
Mala N is a combined oral contraceptive pill that is distributed for free by the Indian government. It contains o.15 mg levonorgestrel and 3o µg ethinyl estradiol. It contains 21 contraceptive pills +  7 iron tablets. It is started on the first day of each cycle.
The combined oral pills act by suppressesing pituitary hormones and preventing ovulation. The   progestogen also causes atrophic changes in the endometrium and prevents implantation. It also causes thickening of the cervical mucus, making it difficult for the sperms to penetrate.
The menstrual side efects includes breakthrough bleeding, menorrhagia and rarely post-pill
amenorrhea when the patient is on drug for more than 6 months. post pill amenorrhea is seen in &lt;1% of patients and should be considered only after ruling out pregnancy.

Q19,"A pregnant woman delivered a baby with the normal expulsion of an intact placenta. After    half an hour she started bleeding per vaginal. on examination, she was hypotensive and a     boggy mass was palpated per abdomen. USG showed retained placental tissues. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)placenta membranacea
b)placenta succenturiata
c)circummarginate placenta
d)circumvallate placenta","The reason for the postpartum hemorrhage in the given patient is likely due to
the succenturiate lobe being torn away and left behind at the time of placental delivery, as seen with cases of placenta succenturiata.



placenta succenturiata refers to the abnormal placenta where an additional lobe/lobes of placental tissue are located a few centimeters away. The ancillary lobes are smaller in size when compared    with the main placental tissue (note: Bilobed placenta has two lobes of equal sizes).These lobes
have vessels that course through the membranes connecting them to the main placental tissue.
placenta succenturiata can be associated with complications like vasa previa (fetal
hemorrhage), postpartum hemorrhage due to retained placental tissues, infection such as endometritis, subinvolution of uterus and placental polyp formation.
An image of this variant is given below where L1,2,3 depicts smaller lobes, Uc is the umbilical cord, and M is the intervening membrane.


The below given image shows a Bilobed or Bipartite or duplex placenta which is different from     placenta succenturiata. The lobes in bilobed placenta are nearly equal in size. The umbilical cord is attached into a connecting chorionic bridge or into the intervening membranes in between the two placental lobes.




other options:
option A: Placenta membranacea is an unduly large and thin placenta that develops
from both the chorionic frondosum and the chorion leave. It is associated with an increased risk of placenta previa or accreta and retained placenta and its complications.
circummarginate placenta (option c) and circumvallate placenta (option D) are a type of extrachorial placentation.
In extrachorial placentation, the chorionic plate is smaller than the basal plate.The chorionic plate does not extend upto the placental margin. The membranes (amnion and chorion) are rolled back  upon themselves to form a ring leaving a rim of bare placental tissue (extrachorial portion)
circummarginate placenta-A thin fibrous ring is present at the margin of the chorionic plate where the fetal vessels appear to terminate.
circumvallate placenta - The fetal surface is divided into a central depressed zone surrounded by a thickened ring which is composed of a double fold of amnion and chorion. Vessels radiate from
the cord insertion as far as the ring and then disappear from the view.
complications associated with circumvallate placenta are preterm delivery, abortions, growth retardation, antepartum hemorrhage, retained placenta, and hydrorrhea gravidarum.

c)Lower β-hcG, PAPP-A and elevated estriol, AFP
d)Lower β-hcG, Inhibin and elevated estriol, AFP","Quadruple screening is a second-trimester multiple marker screening test used for the detection of chromosomal anomalies like Down syndrome. It is performed between 15-21 weeks.
Pregnancies with Down syndrome are characterized by elevated β-hcG, elevated Inhibin A, reduced estriol and reduced AFP levels.
First-trimester aneuploidy screening combines two maternal serum analytes (Dual screening test) with a sonographic measurement. It is performed between 11-14 weeks.
An increased nuchal translucency indicates an increased possibility of Down's syndrome.

Q24,All of the following can be indicators of choriocarcinoma except:,"a)Increased number of theca lutein cysts
b)Persistently enlarged uterus
c)Plateau of high serum hcG
d)Suburethral nodule","Increased number of theca lutein cysts is not an indicator of choriocarcinoma. Increased size or persistence of theca lutein cysts indicates choriocarcinoma.
plateau of high serum β-hcG level for four measurements for ≥3 weeks is an indicator of choriocarcinoma.
Risk factors for malignant change are:
• Molar pregnancy - complete moles have 15-2o% risk, partial moles have 1-5% risk
• patient's age ≥ 4o years or &lt;2o years
• parity ≥3
• Serum β hcG &gt;1,oo,ooo IU/mL
• Uterine size &gt;2o weeks
• previous history of molar pregnancy
• Large theca lutein cysts &gt;6 cm in diameter
post-evacuation uterine sonographic surveillance can be used as a predictor of subsequent neoplasia. Findings indicative of malignant transformation are:
• Suburethral nodules
• Myometrial nodules
• Hypervascularity.",,A,
Q25,which of the following hormones will be secreted in high amounts by the ovarian granulosa cells during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle?,"a)FSH
b)Estrogen
c)LH
d)Progesterone","During the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, estrogen is secreted in high amounts by the ovarian granulosa cell.
Follicular phase (days o–14)
• A primordial follicle develops to the Graafian stage, with atresia of neighboring follicles.
• LH and FSH receptors are up-regulated in theca and granulosa cells.
• Estradiol levels increase and cause the proliferation of the uterus.
• FSH and LH levels are suppressed by the negative feedback effect of estradiol on the anterior pituitary.



• progesterone levels are low.
ovulation (day 14)
• occurs 14 days before menses, regardless of cycle length.
• A burst of estradiol synthesis at the end of the follicular phase has a positive feedback effect on the secretion of FSH and LH (LH surge).
• ovulation occurs as a result of the estrogen-induced LH surge.
• Estrogen levels decrease just after ovulation (but rise again during the luteal phase).
• Cervical mucus increases in quantity; it becomes less viscous and more penetrable by sperm. Luteal phase (days 14–28)
• The corpus luteum begins to develop, and it predominantly synthesizes progesterone.
vascularity and secretory activity of the endometrium increase to prepare for receipt of a fertilized egg.
• Basal body temperature increases because of the effect of progesterone on the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center.
• If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum regresses at the end of the luteal phase. As a result, estradiol and progesterone levels decrease abruptly.
Menses (days o–4)
• The endometrium is sloughed because of the abrupt withdrawal of estradiol and progesterone",,B,5843-3682.PNG
Q26,which of the following statements is true regarding the instrument shown below?,"a)A and B
b)B and C
c)A and C
d)only C","The given image shows a pneumatic compression device. It is used in women who are not on any thromboprophylaxis and planned for cesarean section (statement A) and it is discontinued once    the patient starts ambulating post-surgery (statement C).



The device is used because pregnancy and surgery increase the risk of thromboembolism.
According to recent guidelines, patients with no additional risk factors and not placed on any pharmacological thromboprophylaxis are placed on pneumatic compression devices before
cesarean delivery. patients undergoing cesarean delivery with additional risk factors are put on both pneumatic compression devices and pharmacological therapy (UFH or LMWH).
UFH-unfractionated heparin, LMWH-lower molecular weight heparin.
Indications of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis:
• Inherited coagulation disorder
• overweight or obese patient
• Heart failure
• Family history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism",5822-3673.PNG,C,
Q27,A young female has history of a spontaneous abortion. she has had amenorrhea since then. Her FsH now is 6 mIU/ml. which of the following can be a cause for her amenorrhea?,"a)pituitary dysfunction
b)ovarian dysfunction
c)First pregnancy
d)Uterine synechiae","The development of uterine synechiae is the most likely cause of amenorrhoea in the given clinical scenario.
certain types of spontaneous abortions such as inevitable, incomplete and missed abortions might require medical assistance for complete removal of products of conception including procedures     such as dilatation and curettage.
vigorous uterine curettage in early pregnancy damages the basal layer of endometrium leading to scarring and adhesions in the uterus that interferes with normal endometrial growth and
shedding.This causes the clinical feature of secondary amenorrhea as seen in this patient.
This intrauterine adhesions are known as uterine synechiae or Asherman syndrome.
As there is no defect in the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis in the asherman syndrome, the levels of FSH remain within the normal range of 4 - 25 IU/L as seen in this patient.
In the case of pituitary dysfunction (option A) the FSH levels are usually decreased.
In ovarian dysfunction (option B) the negative feedback of ovarian hormones (estrogen) on pitutary and hypothalamus is lost. Hence, the levels of FSH is increased (≥ 25 IU).
Asherman syndrome is characterised by a spectrum of intra uterine scarring including thin
adhesions, dense bands, or complete obliteration of the uterine cavity. It occurs due to
endometrial damage following vigorous curettage, usually in miscarriage, or elective abortion.
Damage may also occur from other uterine surgeries such as myomectomy or cesarean delivery or from an infection related to an intrauterine device.
Depending on the degree of scarring, patients may present  with amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea or recurrent pregnancy loss due to inadequate placentation.
Asherman syndrome shows multiple filling defects on hysterosalpingography (HSG) or
saline-infusion sonography. Definitive diagnosis requires hysteroscopy. Hysteroscopic lysis of adhesions is the preferred surgical treatment for the syndrome.",,D,
Q28,which among the following is an ideal treatment for a 55-year-old female with simple hyperplasia of the endometrium with atypia?,"a)simple hysterectomy
b)Medroxy progesterone acetate
c)Levonorgesterol
d)Radiotherapy","simple hysterectomy is the best treatment in a case of atypical endometrial hyperplasia in a peri-menopausal and post-menopausal female.
Endometrial hyperplasia with atypia carries 29% risk of developing into endometrial carcinoma and hence, must be treated with total abdominal hysterectomy (simple hysterectomy ).
The presence of any concomitant endometrial cancer must be ruled out by doing fractional curettage (or dilatation and curettage) before doing a hysterectomy.
If a premenopausal woman does not desire to undergo hysterectomy, progesterone can be given and the patient is followed up every 3-6 months. If the atypia persists during the follow-up
hysterectomy should be performed.
The table below summarizes the management of patients with endometrial hyperplasia

Q29,which of the following is an irreversible method of contraception?,"a)Laparoscopic tubal ligation
b)copper-T
c)Implanon
d)LNG-IUD","Among the given options, Laparoscopic tubal ligation is an irreversible method of contraception. Tubal sterilization can be achieved by three methods which are:
• Electrocoagulation is used for the destruction of a segment of the tube
• Mechanical occlusion of the tube using a silicone rubber band (Falope ring) or a spring-loaded clip (Hulka clemens clip)
• suture ligation with or without tubal segment excision such as pomeroy's method, uchida's method, Irving's method, etc.



Intrauterine devices such as copper T and LNG-IUDs and implants belong to the category of long acting reversible contraception.
In copper-T (option B) a copper wire is wrapped around a polypropelene vertical frame. The   copper in the device causes an intense local inflammatory response in the uterus that leads to lysosomal activation and activation of other inflammatory processes that are spermicidal. The Cu-T 38OA is approved for 1O years of continuous use.
LNG-IUD (option D) is a T-shaped polyethylene structure enclosed by a cylinder containing
levonorgesterl. This hormone is released continuously through the permeable cylinder. The
progestin makes the endometrium atrophic and stimulates the production of thick cervical mucus that blocks sperm penetration into the uterus. It also decreases tubal motility, thereby preventing fertilization.
Nexplanon has now replaced implanon (option C) which was a previously used etonogestrel
implant. Nexplanon is a single-rod progestin etonogestrel (68 mg) containing subdermal implant  that provides contraception over 3 years. Its mechanism of action is by suppression of ovulation,  thickened cervical mucus, and endometrial atrophy. Irregular bleeding is an important side effect of the implant. This method of contraception is reversible in nature.

Q30,what is the most useful test in vesicovaginal fistula?,"a)cystoscopy
b)3 swab test
c)MRI
d)cystometry","cystoscopy is the most useful test and also the investigation of choice for vesicovaginal fistula (VVF).
cystoscopy or cystourethroscopy helps to visualize the size of the fistulas, the exact location of
multiple fistulas and their proximity to the ureteral orifice. It can also assess the bladder mucosa for any injuries.
The 3-swab test (option B) is done to identify the types of genitourinary fistula.
In this test, three sterile pieces of cotton swabs are serially placed in the vaginal cavity, while
5o-1ooml of methylene blue solution is instilled in the bladder using a catheter. The cotton swabs are placed one at the vault, one at the middle, and one just above the introitus.
Interpretation:
• uppermost swab gets wet and not stained - the leak is from the ureter, as seen in ureterovaginal fistula
• Middle swab gets stained - the leak is from the bladder, as seen in vesicovaginal fistula
• Lowermost swab gets stained- the leak is from the urethra,as seen in urethrovaginal fistula The below image shows the 3-swab test.





option C: MRI is usually not needed for the diagnosis of vvF. They can be used to study vesicouterine fistulas.
option D: Cystometry is done to measure the capacity of the bladder. It is used to investigate urge incontinence.",,A,5848-3685.PNG
Q31,A 4o-year-old woman has cervical intraepithelial neoplasia III. what would be the management?,"a)Hysterectomy
b)Trachelectomy
c)conization
d)colposcopy with LEEP","Colposcopy with LEEP would be appropriate management for CIN III.
Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is an opd procedure done under colposcopic view and local anesthesia.Here, a low voltage current is passed through the loop and a cone of tissue is removed from the cervix. This procedure causes minimal bleeding and the tissue removed is sent  for histopathological examination (HPE). This is the treatment of choice for CIN 2&amp;3 of any  age and parity.",,D,
Q32,A pregnant woman has gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and her blood glucose levels are well controlled on insulin. what will be the appropriate gestational age for her delivery?,"a)37 weeks
b)39 weeks
c)38 weeks
d)4o weeks","The most appropriate time for the delivery in this patient would be 39 weeks as she has good glycemic control with insulin.
The timing for delivery in a pregnant woman with GDM would vary depending on the control of glucose levels &amp; mode of treatment.

Q33,"A female presents with 35 weeks and 3 days of gestation, AFI = 5 and there is no end-diastolic blood flow. what is the management?","a)Immediate termination
b)Give surfactant and wait till 36 weeks
c)Do Doppler everyday to check for reversion
d)Terminate after 37 weeks","The given case scenario is suggestive of fetal compromise. The management in this patient is immediate termination of pregnancy. since this pregnancy has crossed 34 weeks, it can
be terminated by cesarean section.
Abnormal flow patterns in the umbilical artery:
• Reduced end-diastolic flow indicates uteroplacental insufficiency (s/D ratio increases)
• Absent end-diastolic flow suggests fetal compromise, hence the pregnancy is terminated by C-section if &gt;34 weeks.
• Reverse end-diastolic flow suggests impending doom of death, hence the pregnancy is terminated by C-section if &gt;32 weeks.",,A,5849-3686.PNG
Q34,which of the following heart sounds would be normal in pregnancy?,"a)S3
b)S4
c)Fixed splitting of S2
d)pericardial knock","Among the given options, the presence of third heart sound (s3) is normal in pregnancy.
The third heart sound (s3) occurs due to rapid diastolic filling that is seen secondary to the physiological hypervolemia that occurs during the pregnancy.
other normal auscultatory findings include:
• First heart sound is loud with an exaggerated split
• second heart is loud but normal
• Third heart sound is loud and easily heard
• systolic murmur of grade&lt;3/6
• Mammary murumur or continous machinery murmur
• Apex beat shifted to 4th intercostal space",,A,
Q35,A pregnant woman with cardiac disease is on warfarin therapy. when will the final switch to heparin be advised?,"a)At the onset of labour
b)34 weeks
c)36 weeks
d)4o weeks","The final switch to heparin in a pregnant women is advised at 36 weeks of pregnancy and is continued till 7 days postpartum.
This switch is made from warfarin to heparin at 36 weeks, as warfarin is a strong anticoagulant  which can cause post partum hemorrhage in the mother at the time of labour and can also cross
the placenta into the fetal blood and can increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage in the fetus The below given algorithm is followed for administration of anticoagulants in a pregnant female: LMWH- low molecular weight heparin
UFH- Unfractionated heparin

Period of pregnancy	Anticoagulation of choice
First trimester	If dose of warfarin< 5mg/day
