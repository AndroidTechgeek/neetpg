Q1,which of the following marked structures is a branch of the internal carotid artery?,"a)1
b)2
c)3
d)4","The structure marked 1 is the anterior ethmoidal artery, which is a branch of the ophthalmic division of the internal carotid artery.
other structures marked in the diagram are as follows:
2 – sphenopalatine artery
3 – Greater palatine artery
4 – superior labial artery
2, 3 and 4 are derived from branches of the external carotid artery.
The nasal septum is supplied by branches of both internal and external carotid arteries.",3212-1971.PNG,A,3214-1972.PNG
Q2,which of the following is not an etiological factor for head and neck malignancies?,"a)EBV infection
b)HPV infection
c)Betel nut
d)Vitamin A deficiency","vitamin A deficiency is not a risk factor for head and neck malignancies. vitamin A deficiency is a risk factor for esophageal cancer.
The head and neck cancers include cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, paranasal sinuses, nasal cavity, and salivary glands. squamous cell cancer is the most common head and neck
malignancy, often linked to tobacco and alcohol use. Non-squamous malignancies include thyroid cancer, salivary gland cancer, and sarcomas.
The risk factors for head and neck malignancies are listed below:
oral cavity cancer:
• Tobacco, smokeless tobacco like Bidi, chutta, paan (oral tobacco mixed with betel leaf, areca nut, and salted lime), khaini, and marijuana

• Alcohol, poor oral hygiene, and intake of red meat and salted meat
• Infections with human papillomavirus, and HIV
• Genetic conditions like  Li-Fraumeni, ataxia telangiectasia, Bloom syndrome, and Fanconi's anemia.
oropharyngeal cancer:
• smoking and alcohol
• HPV 16 and 18
cancer of the larynx and hypopharynx:
• Tobacco and alcohol
• Nickel, mustard gas, and asbestos exposure
• Long-term exposure to sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid in battery plant workers.
• Postcricoid carcinoma is associated with previous radiation and sideropenic dysphagia
• HPV infection and immunosuppression Nasopharyngeal cancer:
• chinese population
• Epstein Barr virus infection
• Nitrosamines in salted fish and meat
• Vitamin c deficiency
cancers of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus:
• Tobacco
• occupational exposure to dust from wood, textiles, and leather. Nickel and chromium dust and mustard gas exposure.
• HPV 16 and 18 Thyroid cancer:
• Females
• Previous radiation
• Inherited conditions like Gardner syndrome, familial polyposis, and cowden syndrome. Medullary thyroid cancer associated with MEN-2 syndrome
salivary gland carcinoma:
• Previous radiation
• Exposure to nickel alloy dust, and silica dust
• smoking and heavy alcohol consumption were linked to a higher risk of salivary gland cancer in men but not in women
• Early menarche and nulliparity",,D,
Q3,which of the following structures are not removed in radical neck dissection?,"a)Tail of parotid
b)sublingual gland
c)submandibular gland
d)Level 2b lymph nodes","Sublingual gland is not removed in radical neck dissection (RND). Submandibular gland is removed in RND.
RND involves the removal of:
• All lymph nodes from Levels I through to v (submental, submandibular, upper, middle, and lower jugular, and posterior triangle regions) along with its fibrofatty tissue.
• The spinal accessory nerve
• Internal jugular vein
• Sternocleidomastoid muscle
• Tail of parotid
• Submandibular gland
• omohyoid muscle",,B,
Q4,which of the following features is not associated with superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome?,"a)Gaze dependent nystagmus
b)positive Fistula test
c)sensorineural hearing loss
d)positive Tulio phenomenon","Sensorineural hearing loss is not seen in superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome (SSCDS). They may experience mild to moderate hearing conductive loss.
Conductive hearing loss is due to the abnormal transmission and dissipation of acoustic energy through the defect (third window), leading to reduced conduction to the cochlea for lower
frequencies. This can manifest as a low-frequency air-bone gap at multiple frequencies. There is no defect in the cochlea or the auditory pathway.
Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) is a condition in which bone between the apex of the superior semicircular canal and the middle cranial fossa is absent. This causes endolymph in the labyrinthine system to move with sound or pressure, causing an activation of the vestibular   system.
Patients may have vestibular symptoms like vertigo triggered by loud sounds (Tullio
phenomenon)or pressure such as coughing and can also experience hyperacusis for
bone-conducted sounds. They may perceive the sounds of their own eye movements or footsteps in the affected ear.
The patients may exhibit nystagmus when exposed to loud sounds or during the valsalva
maneuver or pressure in the ear canal (positive fistula test). The direction of the nystagmus aligns with the affected superior semicircular canal, and some patients may tilt their heads in the plane   of the affected superior semicircular canal in response to loud sounds.
Noncontrast HRCT ofthe temporal bone can demonstrate the defect. The click-evoked vEMP (vestibular evoked myogenic potential) response and vestibuloocular reflex are pronounced in SSCD patients, in which the evoked eye movements align with the affected superior canal.
For mild symptoms, avoidance of triggers is recommended. In case of severe disabling symptoms, surgical resurfacing of the superior semicircular canal or plugging of the superior semicircular
canal may be attempted.",,C,
Q5,"A patient undergoes surgery of the lateral part of the base of the skull. postoperatively, the
patient presents with aspiration but does not have a change in voice. which of the following is the reason?","a)superior laryngeal nerve injury
b)Glossopharyngeal nerve injury
c)Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury
d)High vagal injury","In the given clinical scenario, the patient experiences aspiration but does not exhibit any change in voice following base of skull surgery. This suggests an injury to the superior laryngeal nerve    (SLN).
In SLN injury, only the cricothyroid muscle is involved which is used only in high-pitch
vocalization, normal speech will not be affected. SLN also provides sensory supply to the mucosa above vocal cords, hence its lesion would lead to increased susceptibility to aspiration.
other options:
option B: The glossopharyngeal nerve does not provide sensory or motor supply to the larynx.
option C and D: The patient also has normal vocalization which rules out recurrent laryngeal
nerve (RLN) and high vagal injury. RLN supplies all the intrinsic muscles of the larynx except     cricothyroid, therefore an RLN lesion would lead to disordered vocalization. A high vagal injury would mean that both the SLN and RLN functions are affected, therefore that can also be ruled  out.",,A,
