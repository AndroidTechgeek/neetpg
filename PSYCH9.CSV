"Q1","During psychotherapy, the therapist had mixed conscious and unconscious feelings towards his patient. This is known as_____.","a)countertransference
b)Transference
c)Dissociation
d)preoccupation","In the given clinical scenario, the therapist has mixed conscious and unconscious feelings towards his patient. This is known as counter-transference.
counter-transference is the positive and negative feelings/emotions expressed by healthcare
professionals towards their patients. It is the process of the physician unconsciously displacing
onto the patient patterns of behaviors or emotional reactions as if he/she were a significant figure from earlier in the physician's life. psychiatrists should be alert to signs of countertransference
issues like missed appointments by the psychiatrist, boredom, or sleepiness during a session.
supervision and personal therapy can help the psychiatrist recognize and deal with these issues.



Transference is the positive and negative feelings expressed by the patients towards the healthcare professional. It is the process of the patient unconsciously displacing onto individuals patterns of   behavior and emotional reactions that originated with significant figures from the past (generally   in childhood). This displacement is onto the psychiatrist in a clinical scenario, who is a parent
surrogate. The patient may be angry, hostile, demanding, or obedient to an extreme degree
because of former relationships and patterns of behaviors. Failure to recognize this can make the psychiatrist react to the patient's behavior like a personal attack.
These are not defense mechanisms but are commonly encountered during clinical practice or while giving psychotherapy. In an interview, transference and counter-transference are very   significant expressions of unconscious processes.
option C: Dissociation is an immature defense mechanism. In this, involuntary
splitting/suppression of mental functions occurs from the rest of the personality in a way that
allows the expression of forbidden unconscious impulses without having a sense of responsibility for actions.","","A",""
"Q2","A patient stopped alcohol consumption for 3 days and presented with irritability,
disorientation, paranoid delusions, agitation, visual hallucinations, and altered sensorium. what is the likely diagnosis in this case?","a)Delirium tremens
b)wernicke's encephalopathy
c)korsakoff psychosis
d)Alcohol induced psychosis","The given clinical scenario of a patient who has not consumed alcohol for the past 3 days with    disorientation, paranoid delusions, visual hallucinations, and altered sensorium is suggestive of delirium tremens.
Delirium tremens is a medical emergency that occurs during alcohol withdrawal. It is an acute condition and usually develops within 72 hours after the last drink. It has symptoms of both     delirium and alcohol withdrawal. The clinical features of delirium tremens are:
• Altered sensorium with disorientation
• perceptual distortions, most frequently tactile or visual hallucinations
• Autonomic hyperactivity with tachycardia, fever, anxiety, insomnia, hypertension. And sweating
• Fluctuating levels of psychomotor activity, ranging from agitation to lethargy
• Altered sleep-wake cycle
other options:
option B - wernicke’s encephalopathy (alcoholic encephalopathy) is associated with thiamine     deficiency. Alcohol abuse may lead to thiamine deficiency because of poor nutritional habits, or malabsorption. It is an acute neurological disorder characterized by:
• Global confusion
• ocular abnormalities like horizontal nystagmus, gaze palsy, anisocoria, and sluggish pupillary reflex
• Ataxia - mainly affecting the gait
• vestibular dysfunction
It may resolve with thiamine therapy or progress to korsakoff's syndrome.



option c - korsakoff’s psychosis can follow wernicke’s encephalopathy due to thiamine
deficiency. It is a chronic amnestic syndrome that is characterized by the following clinical symptoms in an intact and responsive patient:
• Impaired mental syndrome, especially recent memory
• Anterograde amnesia
• confabulation
option D - Alcohol-induced psychosis is characterized by the development of auditory
hallucinations or paranoid delusions in the context of a heavy drinking or alcohol withdrawal.
These patients have a clear sensorium, unlike the patients having delirium tremens.
Note: Tremulousness is the first alcohol withdrawal symptom.","","A",""
"Q3","A teacher demonstrated the steps of handwashing to her students. students also performed the same activity later at school and at home. what is the type of learning in this case?","a)cognitive
b)psychomotor
c)Affective
d)Affective and cognitive","The type of learning seen in this case is psychomotor learning.
The psychomotor domain includes learning by observation, physical movements, and the usage of motor skill areas of the brain. The development of these skills requires practice, depending upon    the complexity of the task. It is measured based on speed, precision, distance, and procedures in    execution.
The three domains in learning are the cognitive, psychomotor, and affective domains. They are described as follows.
cognitive learning includes the domain of knowledge. Bloom's taxonomy described six levels of
cognitive skills. This was revised to include types of knowledge and cognitive processes. The
cognitive processes include remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and
creating. Eg. solving multiple-choice questions in the NEET PG entrance exam involves the usage of the cognitive domain.
Psychomotor learning includes the domain of skills. It includes imitation, manipulation,
precision, articulation, and naturalization. Eg. Learning how to insert an IV cannula by observing the residents and nurses during the internship involves the usage of the psychomotor domain.
Affective learning includes the domain of attitude and values. It includes receiving, responding, valuing, organizing, and characterization by value. Eg. communicating with patients with
empathy, responding to their concerns, and interacting with the relatives of patients involves the usage of the affective domain.
Integration of all these three methods in teaching and learning methodology leads to a better understanding of the subject.","","B",""
"Q4","which of the following is a formal thought disorder?","a)obsession
b)Derailment
c)Delusion
d)Thought insertion","Derailment is a formal thought disorder.



It is a breakdown in both the logical connection between ideas and the overall sense of being  goal-oriented. It is generally identified in schizophrenic patients as a generalized loosening of associations.
For example, a person with derailment thought disorder might jump from talking about rabbits to the hair on their head to your sweater. They talk in chains of semi-related ideas. Their
communication style has a generalized loosening of associations. Their ideas often fall further and further from the topic.
Formal thought disorders are:
• circumstantiality is the overinclusion of trivial or irrelevant details that impedes the sense of getting to the point.
• clang association is an association of thoughts with the sound of words rather than by their meaning (e.g., through rhyming).
• Derailment is the breakdown in both the logical connection between ideas and the overall sense of goal-directedness. The words make sentences, but the sentences do not make sense.
• Flight of ideas is a succession of multiple associations so that thoughts seem to move abruptly from idea to idea, through rapid, pressured speech.
• Neologism is the invention of new words or phrases or the use of conventional words in idiosyncratic ways.
• perseveration is the repetition of out-of-context words, phrases, or ideas.
• Tangentiality is responding to a question, that is appropriate to the general topic without actually answering the question.
• Thought blocking is a sudden disruption of thought or a break in the flow of ideas.
other options:
option A - An obsession is a recurrent and intrusive thought, feeling, idea, or sensation.
option c - A delusion is defined as a false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that firmly sustains despite evidence to the contrary.
option D - Thought insertion is a type of delusion where the patient believes that thoughts are not his/her own and have been inserted into his/her mind.","","B",""
"Q5","A 16-year-old girl presented with overfamiliarity, flight of ideas, elevated mood, increased sexual desire, and pseudohallucination. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Mania
b)Hypomania
c)cyclothymia
d)schizomania","In the given clinical scenario, history of overfamiliarity, elevated mood, flight of ideas, and increased sexual desire are suggestive of mania.
The diagnostic criteria for mania are:
A. Distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated/irritable mood, and abnormally and persistently increased activity/energy, lasting at least 1 week.
B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy/activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms are present to a significant degree:
1. Increased self-esteem or grandiosity



2. Decreased need for sleep
3. More talkative than usual or a pressure to keep talking
4. Flight of ideas
5. Distractibility
6. Increase in goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation
7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions)
C. The mood disturbance is severe enough to cause marked social or occupational impairment or to necessitate hospitalization.
D. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or to another medical condition.
other options:
option B - Hypomania is a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated/irritable mood, abnormally and persistently increased activity/energy, lasting for at least 4 days. It is similar to a   manic episode but it is not severe enough to cause impairment in social or occupational
functioning. No psychotic features are present.
option C - Cyclothymia is a mild, chronic mood disorder with numerous depressive and hypomanic episodes over the course of at least 2 years.
option D - schizomania is an old term in DsM III, used to describe schizophrenic and manic
symptomatology occurring in one episode, classified under schizoaffective disorder.
schizoaffective disorder is characterized by active phase symptoms of schizophrenia, like
delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized behavior, or negative
symptoms. Additionally, there is a presence of manic/depressive syndrome that is not brief
relative to the duration of the psychosis. The delusions or hallucinations are present for at least 2 weeks without coexisting mood symptoms.","","A",""
