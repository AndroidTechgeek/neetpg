Q1,A patient underwent surgery for breast carcinoma. she now presents with painless swelling involving the arm as shown in the image below. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Lymphedema
b)Lymphangiosarcoma
c)venous thrombosis
d)cellulitis","The generalized swelling of the left arm of the patient post-surgery for breast carcinoma is suggestive of post-mastectomy lymphedema.
Lymphoedema occurs when interstitial fluid accumulates due to defective lymphatic drainage. It is a common complication of breast cancer treatment, involving axillary lymph node
dissection and radiotherapy. sentinel lymph node dissection (sLND) reduces the risk of lymphedema significantly.
clinical signs and symptoms are observed in the ipsilateral arm. A significant increase in limb size due to swelling is seen. other symptoms are heaviness, tightness, numbness, tingling, limb
fatigue, and reduced limb mobility.
Diagnosis is predominantly based on the clinical swelling of the arm. The girth of the affected arm &gt;2 centimetres than the normal limb, a 2oo-mL or more increase in limb volume, or a 5% or      greater limb volume change are other diagnostic criteria.
Management:
• Limb elevation, elastic arm stockings, and pneumatic compression devices to reduce swelling.
• using a low-pH water-based moisturizer to prevent dry skin caused by excess fluid
accumulation.
• Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) by a therapist followed by simple lymphatic drainage (sLD) by the patient daily aids interstitial fluid evacuation.
• surgical options include lymphaticovenular anastomosis, liposuction, and debulking.
other options:
option B:   stewart-Treves syndrome refers to lymphangiosarcoma seen in chronic long-standing lymphedema following mastectomy (more than 1o years). They present as single/multiple
bluish-red skin and subcutaneous nodules. They can ulcerate and hemorrhage.
option c: Axillary venous thrombosis or paget-schrotter disease is seen in patients doing rigorous exercise and in weightlifters. The compression of the subclavian vein at the thoracic outlet causes   painful swelling of the arm.
option D: cellulitis (lymphangitis) is a bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It is characterized by a painful area of erythematous and edematous tissue.",4907-3062.PNG,A,
Q2,which of the following statements is true regarding the condition given below?,"a)patient must be started on anti-gas gangrene serum therapy
b)It is a mixed flora aerobic and anaerobic infection
c)Bilateral orchidectomy is generally performed
d)compulsory urinary diversion is performed","The given image of extensive perineal soft tissue destruction with intact testis is suggestive of Fournier's gangrene, which is a mixed flora of aerobic and anaerobic infection.
Fournier's gangrene is a type of necrotizing fasciitis (Dartos, scarpa, and colle’s fascia) of the perineum, external genitalia, and perianal region. Risk factors include:
• Immunocompromised states such as HIV, alcoholism, diabetes, etc.
• Minor procedures in the perineal area (opening of a periurethral abscess).
pathogenesis is due to the obliteration of arterioles supplying the scrotal skin caused by
fulminating subcutaneous polybacterial infection. After a while, the blackish discolouration of the scrotum (gangrene) with crepitus can be seen (image). The testis is usually not affected.
clinical features of Fournier's gangrene are scrotal pain, fever, prostration, and pallor. cellulitis spreads rapidly and may be associated with eschars, necrosis, flaking skin, and crepitus.
Diagnosis of Fournier's gangrene is majorly clinical and is a surgical emergency. It should be aggressively managed by urgent surgical debridement and skin grafting in later stages. The    infection is controlled by the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.


other options:
option A: Anti-gas gangrene serum refers to refined equine antitoxin against clostridium species. Hence, it has no role in Fournier's gangrene.
option c: Bilateral orchidectomy is not performed as testes are not affected and need not be removed.
option D: urinary diversion may be necessary in a few cases, and is not compulsory.",4908-3064.PNG,B,4917-3071.PNG
Q3,A baby playing unsupervised was brought with complaints of difficulty in swallowing for the last few hours. The X-ray image is given below. what is the diagnosis?,"a)Foreign body in the trachea
b)Foreign body in the esophagus
c)Artifact
d)soft tissue calcification in the neck","The clinical picture of the child presenting with difficulty in swallowing and the chest X-rays (AP and lateral) showing a circular homogenous opacity in the neck region is suggestive of a foreign   body (coin) lodged in the esophagus.
Foreign bodies commonly ingested by children are coins, disk batteries, and small toy items. In adults, it is usually a food bolus (mostly meat) that gets lodged.
The flat surface of a coin is seen on the anteroposterior view (AP view) and the edge is seen on the lateral view. This indicates that it is oriented in the coronal plane, which is seen when it is lodged  in the esophagus (and not in the trachea).
Initial symptoms are choking, gagging, and coughing followed by excessive salivation, dysphagia, food refusal, vomiting, or pain in the neck and throat. Respiratory symptoms such as stridor,
wheezing, cyanosis, or dyspnea are seen if the esophageal foreign body impinges on the larynx or tracheal wall.
Imaging with chest and abdominal X-rays should be performed in AP and lateral positions. Chest CT should always be performed if oesophageal perforation is suspected.
Endoscopic removal of the esophageal foreign body is the procedure of choice. It should be performed
• Immediately in esophageal obstruction, disk batteries, and sharp pointed objects.
• within 12-24h in non-pointed objects, pointed objects in the stomach, and coins in the esophagus.
• Non-urgent removal in objects in stomach &gt;2.5cm in diameter, and disk battery in the stomach (up to 48h)
other options:
option A: For coins lodged in the trachea, the edge is seen anteroposteriorly view and the flat side is seen in the lateral view of the X-rays (oriented in the sagittal plane).
option C: Artifacts refer to an appearance or unintended structure that is not normally seen on the radiograph and is produced by some artificial means. It can occur due to technical or
processing errors while taking a radiograph.
option D: Soft tissue calcification in the neck is due to physiologic or pathological conditions.
Commonly encountered soft tissue calcifications in the head and neck region include tonsilloliths, carotid artery calcifications, and calcified stylohyoid ligaments.",4908-3063.PNG,B,
Q4,A 75-year-old man with prostate carcinoma presents to you with a PsA of 9 ng/mL with a small tumor focus. His Gleason score is 6. what will be your most likely management?,"a)Radical prostatectomy
b)External beam radiation
c)Brachytherapy
d)Active surveillance","The given clinical vignette of a 75-year-old man, with a low PSA (&lt;1o ng/ml), Gleason score of 6, and a small tumor focus point to a diagnosis of low-risk prostatic carcinoma. The most likely
management for this patient would be active surveillance only.
Active surveillance is done when there is:
• Gleason score of 6
• Early-stage disease (T1c)



• Small volume disease on biopsy
• Low PSA (&lt; 1o ng/ml)
Active surveillance protocols include a digital rectal examination and PSA monitoring every 3 to 6 months, with TRUS-guided prostate biopsies every 1 to 3 years.
Gleason grading system evaluates the abnormalities in the glandular architecture of the prostate. It is based on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the most differentiated grade and 5 being the least
differentiated. The grades are added to give the Gleason score.
The classification and management of carcinoma prostate are outlined below:
EBRT: External beam radiation therapy, TURP: Transurethral resection of the prostate

Grade	Treatment
Low Risk	Radical prostatectomy (<7o y ears),Active surveillance (>7o years)
Intermediate Ris k	Radical prostatectomy and/or Radical radiotherapy(EBRT)  (<7o years)Active surveillanc  e +/- TURP and hormone the  rapy (>7o years)
High Risk	Early androgen ablation + Ra diotherapy + Surgical treatm  ent (< 7o years)
Metastatic diseas e	Systemic chemotherapy with  palliative treatment ( <7o yea rs)Androgen ablation therapy and palliative treatment for   symptomatic patients",,D,
Q5,Identify the gross specimen obtained from a cystoprostatectomy.,"a)Malakoplakia
b)Bladder carcinoma
c)Prostate carcinoma
d)schistosomiasis","The given image of the cystoprostatectomy specimen shows a large, fungating growth from the
bladder wall involving the entire bladder. The two lobes of the prostate are not affected. The given specimen is that of bladder carcinoma.
Clinical features of bladder carcinoma include painless, gross hematuria (most common
symptom), which may cause clots and urinary retention subsequently. Increased frequency and discomfort during urination may be seen.
Depending upon the depth of invasion, bladder carcinoma is divided into 3 groups:
• Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer - does not invade detrusor muscle but can invade lamina propria. It accounts for 7o% of cases.
• Muscle-invasive bladder cancer - invades the detrusor muscle
• Flat, non-invasive carcinoma in situ (CIS)



staging and diagnosis:
It is done by cystoscopy and resection of the tumor. A bimanual examination should be performed after resection of the tumor. Complete urinary tract imaging is required using contrast computed   tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) urography.
Management:
• Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer:
• Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) followed by intravesical chemotherapy with mitomycin C or epirubicin
• Immunotherapy with regular intravesical instillations of Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) in high-risk tumors.
• Muscle invasive bladder cancer: Radical cystectomy along with urinary diversion procedure and lymph node dissection +/- neoadjuvant chemotherapy
other options:
option A: Malakoplakia is a rare inflammatory condition that is typically seen in
immunocompromised individuals. The term 'malakoplakia' means 'soft plaques'. General
principles of treatment include systemic antibiotics, surgical excision, and limiting
immunosuppression. surgical excision is done for malakoplakia lesions based on the site affected, complications, and if medical treatment fails.
option B: prostatic carcinoma can be surgically managed by radical prostatectomy, which does not involve cystectomy. In prostatic carcinoma usually, one or more of the lobes are
predominantly involved unlike in the given gross specimen.
option D: schistosomiasis of the bladder is a parasitic infection by schistosoma hematobium. on cystoscopy, it can look like nodules, pseudo tubercles, ulceration, sandy patches, and in the end    stage can cause squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder.",4909-3065.PNG,B,
Q6,"A patient after a road traffic accident presented with pain abdomen. The resident examines the child and found that vitals were stable and tenderness was present in the left lumbar
region. which is the best investigation of choice?","a)Contrast enhanced CT scan
b)Retrograde urethrogram
c)wait and watch
d)Emergency laparotomy","The given clinical vignette with abdominal pain and tenderness in the left lumbar region following a road traffic accident is suggestive of blunt renal trauma. The investigation of choice is CECT in a hemodynamically stable patient.
Blunt trauma is the main cause of renal injuries and is generally self-limiting. Radiological investigations are indicated when there is gross haematuria, shock in combination with
microscopic haematuria, pediatric renal trauma, and penetrating injuries.
CECT is the investigation of choice. It assesses the extent of the injury, showing laceration,
extravasation, surrounding hemorrhage, and vessel injury. It also shows non-renal injuries and
effectively stages renal pedicle injuries. Arterial occlusion will manifest as rim enhancement of the normal renal contour.
Blunt trauma is mostly treated conservatively. Most of the penetrating injuries require surgical renal exploration.
Absolute indications for surgical intervention in renal trauma are:



• Massive hemorrhage
• Renal pedicle avulsion (grade 5 injury)
• Expanding, pulsatile, or uncontained retroperitoneal hematoma
Relative indications are:
• Large laceration of the renal pelvis or avulsion of the ureteropelvic junction
• Bowel or pancreatic injuries
• persistent urinary leakage, postinjury urinoma, or perinephric abscess
• complete renal artery thrombosis of both kidneys
• Renal hypertension
other options:
option D: Exploratory laparotomy is recommended in unstable patients and those with
penetrating renal injuries.",,A,
Q7,A patient with rectal prolapse underwent surgery. The postoperative image is given below. Identify the procedure.,"a)stapled hemorroidopexy
b)well's procedure
c)Thiersch wiring
d)Altemeier repair","The postoperative image shows a purse-string suture which is suggestive of Thiersch wiring for rectal prolapse.
In Thiersch's wiring, a steel wire or a silastic/nylon tape is placed around the anal canal. It is     rarely done now due to post-operative problems like chronic perineal sepsis, anal stenosis, and obstructed defecation.
Rectal prolapse is of two types:
• partial rectal prolapse - only the mucosal layer of the rectum is prolapsed. It is seen in children and is managed by digital repositioning. If there is a recurrence, then Theirsch's wiring or
sclerotherapy is performed.
• complete rectal prolapse - all the layers of the rectum are involved. It is seen in adults due to the weakening of the pelvic floor. It is managed by using the following approaches:
• The perineal approach - easy to perform, and has fewer complications but a high recurrence rate.
It is preferred in elderly patients with comorbidities. The surgeries done include:
• Thiersch's wiring
• Delorme's mucosectomy - In this procedure, the rectal mucosa is stripped circumferentially from the rectum over the length of the prolapse. The underlying muscle is plicated with a series of
sutures. The excess rectal mucosa is excised and a mucosal anastomosis is performed.
• Altemeier's recto sigmoidectomy (option D) - In this procedure, full-thickness resection of the prolapsed rectum is performed, incorporating any associated colonic prolapse. Restoration of
colorectal continuity can be performed by hand-sewn/stapled anastomosis. This is the procedure of choice in patients presenting with incarcerated and strangulated prolapse.
• The abdominal approach - It is difficult to perform and has more complications, but a lower recurrence rate. The surgeries done include:



• Ripstein's procedure - It involves the placement of a prosthetic mesh around the mobilized   rectum, with the attachment of the mesh to the presacral fascia below the sacral promontory.
• well's procedure (option B) - It involves posterior rectopexy.
other options:
option A: stapled hemorroidopexy is used in the treatment of internal hemorrhoids, where a
circular stapling device is used to excise a cylinder of mucosa and submucosa and simultaneously staple the mucosal ends together.",4910-3066.PNG,C,
Q8,"A patient presents after a motorcycle road traffic accident with no reported pain or injury.  During examination, blood is observed at the tip of the urethral meatus, and the bladder is



non-palpable. what would be your next step in management?","a)Foley's catheterization
b)wait for bladder to fill
c)Nephrogram
d)Suprapubic cystostomy","The given clinical scenario showing blood at the tip of the urethral meatus following a road traffic accident (RTA) is a clinical hallmark of a urethral injury. The next best step in this scenario is to    wait and watch.
Injuries to the urethra are more common in males. They are of:

part of the urethra	Injury type	clinical features
Bulbarurethra(distal urethral injury)	Blunt traumato the perineu m	Butterfly hematoma(perineal bruising), urinary retention,   and bleeding from the urethr al tip
Bulbomembranousjunction(p roximal urethral injury)	Road traffic accidents	Blood at the tip of the meatu  s and urinary retentionHigh-  riding prostateon digital rect   al examination (vermooten si gn)


Retrograde urethrography using water-soluble contrast is used for localizing the site of urethral injury.



The patient should be managed with analgesia and antibiotics. If the bladder is full, it should be    drained with a catheter placed by percutaneous suprapubic puncture using a seldinger technique.
other options:
option A: Foley catheterization should not be done since it might convert a partial tear into a complete tear.
option C: Nephrogram is not done but retrograde urethrogram is performed in urethral injury.
option D: suprapubic Cystostomy is done only in cases where the bladder is full or the patient is unable to urinate following a pelvic fracture/ RTA.",,B,4923-3072.PNG
Q9,A patient presents with a hernia medial to the inferior epigastric artery. what is the most likely diagnosis and appropriate management for the same?,"a)Direct hernia and Bassini repair
b)Direct hernia and Lichtenstein mesh repair
c)Indirect hernia and Bassini repair
d)Indirect hernia and Lichtenstein mesh repair","The given clinical scenario of a hernia medial to the inferior epigastric artery is suggestive of a direct hernia, for which Lichtenstein mesh repair is the appropriate surgical method for its
management.
The contents of a direct hernia protrude outward, forward, and medial to the inferior epigastric    artery and the deep inguinal ring. whereas, the contents of an indirect hernia protrude lateral to  the inferior epigastric artery. The sac of an indirect inguinal hernia passes from the deep inguinal ring obliquely towards the superficial inguinal ring and then to the scrotum.
A direct hernia protrudes through the Hesselbach triangle, which is a zone of weakness for direct hernias.
A Lichtenstein mesh repair is currently one of the most frequently used methods for treating an   inguinal hernia. It is done for the reconstruction of the inguinal floor in adults. It is an anterior    tension-free mesh repair that reduces the chances of recurrence of a hernia. A piece of prosthetic nonabsorbable mesh is used to bridge the defect in this repair.


other surgical methods used for the repair of an inguinal hernia are:



• Bassini repair - It is done for the reconstruction of the inguinal floor in adults. In this method, a  mesh is not used. It is associated with a high recurrence and is not used frequently now. It is used only in cases of hernial strangulation and peritonitis where the use of a mesh is not preferred. It is performed by suturing the transversus abdominis and internal oblique musculoaponeurotic
arches/conjoined tendon to the inguinal ligament.
• shouldice repair - It is a multilayered repair, where the posterior wall of the inguinal canal is    strengthened by continuous sutures. It involves double-breasting of the transversalis fascia. It is associated with a very low recurrence rate.
• Gilbert repair (plug and patch repair) - It is an extension of Lichtenstein’s original mesh repair and has now become the most commonly performed primary anterior inguinal hernia repair. In this technique, a cone-shaped plug of polypropylene mesh is used. It is deployed like an
upside-down umbrella when inserted into the internal inguinal ring to occlude the hernia
• Mcvay repair (Cooper's ligament repair) is used for the correction of direct inguinal hernia, large indirect hernia, recurrent hernia, femoral hernias (particularly suited for strangulated femoral
hernias). In this method, the transversus abdominis aponeurosis is approximated to Cooper's ligament.
• stoppa-Rives repair - It is used for the repair of large, recurrent, or bilateral hernias. In this method, a sub-umbilical midline incision is given to place a large mesh into the preperitoneal space.
• Herniotomy - It is used to treat inguinal hernia in a child which occurs due to the presence of     a patent processus vaginalis. Therefore in herniotomy, the repair of the inguinal ring is not done.",,B,4923-3072.PNG
Q10,"A patient following a road traffic accident presented with subcutaneous emphysema. on
auscultation, there was no air entry on the right side. Vitals were unstable. what will be your immediate management?","a)Insertion of wide bore needle in the 5th intercostal space (ICS)
b)wide bore needle decompression and IV fluids
c)Intubation and positive pressure ventilation
d)eFAST","The given clinical scenario of a patient with h/o road traffic accident (RTA) with no air entry on     the right side and hemodynamic instability suggests a diagnosis of tension pneumothorax. This is managed by immediate decompression by insertion of a needle in the appropriate place.
pneumothorax refers to the presence of excess air in the pleural space. Entrapment of air occurs by:
• primary spontaneous pneumothorax - due to the spontaneous rupture of apical pleural blebs or cystic spaces immediately below the visceral pleura.
• secondary pneumothorax - due to the rupture of dilated cystic spaces in lung diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COpD)
• Tension pneumothorax -  a one-way valve mechanism that directs airflow into the pleural space leading to a higher than atmospheric pressure environment, and prevents expansion of the lung.
Tension pneumothorax is characterized by chest pain, tachypnoea, tachycardia, and hypotension. On examination, the trachea is deviated away from the side of the injury, and breath sounds are   absent on the affected lung. A patient can develop subcutaneous emphysema as a complication,    secondary to the pneumothorax.
Tension pneumothorax is a surgical emergency and the excessive pressure has to be immediately relieved. Tension pneumothorax is managed by immediate needle decompression in the 5th
intercostal space (ICs), followed by definitive management with a chest tube inserted in the same




space.


other options:
option B: while IV fluids are a part of the resuscitation protocol, hypotension in a tension
pneumothorax is due to an obstructive type of shock, increasing circulating volume will have minimal effect on improving blood pressure. The management of the primary cause, tension pneumothorax, takes higher precedence as the next immediate step.
option C: Intubation is performed when the patient is unresponsive post chest tube insertion.
option D: Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (eFAST) is not required   before emergency decompression as tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis, but it can be performed following chest tube insertion.",,A,4926-3073-1.png
Q11,"A 54-year-old female patient presents with abdominal pain and bilious vomiting. She had a
history of abdominal hysterectomy 2 years back. on examination, abdomen auscultation
revealed high-pitched bowel sounds. Investigations showed air within the biliary tree. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Gallstone ileus
b)Adhesive intestinal obstruction
c)Ischemic enterocolitis
d)Diverticulitis","The given scenario shows abdominal pain with bilious vomiting and high-pitched bowel sounds
which are suggestive of intestinal obstruction along with radiographic features of pneumobilia (air within the biliary tree) pointing to the diagnosis of gallstone ileus.
Gallstone ileus is a condition that occurs secondary to the erosion of the gallbladder wall, which    results in a fistula to the duodenum. Through this, a large gallstone can pass from the gallbladder to the duodenum and usually gets impacted in the distal ileum (the most common site), where it   may cause intestinal obstruction.
Rigler’s triad is a characteristic radiological feature seen in gallstone ileus and consists of:
• pneumobilia - air present in the intestine passes into the biliary tree through the fistula
• Features of small bowel obstruction (abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, hyperechoic bowel sounds)
• Ectopic gallstone - usually in the right iliac fossa





plain X-rays show air-fluid levels consistent with a small bowel obstruction and pneumobilia can also be visualized on CT imaging.
Gallstone ileus is managed by an explorative laparotomy to relieve the bowel obstruction. The stone is milked away from the site of impacted and then crushed or removed.
other complications of gallstones include biliary colic, acute and chronic cholecystitis, empyema of the gallbladder, mucocele, perforation, acute cholangitis, and acute pancreatitis.
other options:
option B: Adhesive intestinal obstruction is seen after any abdominal surgery or any cause for peritoneal irritation, the features are consistent with bowel obstruction (air-fluid levels,
featureless distal ileum) but there is no pneumobilia.
option C: Ischaemic colitis on contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen (CECT) shows bowel wall thickening, and signs of vascular insufficiency.
option D: Diverticulitis on CT abdomen shows bright bowel outpouching, which may be complicated by infection and abscess formation.",,A,4926-3073.PNG
Q12,"In a patient with abdominal pain and sterile pyuria, what is the finding shown in the image given?","a)putty kidney
b)Nephrocalcinosis
c)staghorn calculus
d)psoas calcification","A patient with abdominal pain with sterile pyuria and the abdominal X-ray showing homogenous ground glass-like calcification is suggestive of a putty kidney.
The putty kidney is a characteristic finding of genitourinary tuberculosis (GUTB). It is caused by the dissemination of the organism through the bloodstream and is always a secondary TB
(reinfection or reactivation of old TB). Genitourinary TB usually presents as sterile pyuria.
Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is the most sensitive modality and is the preferred means of visualizing renal calcifications. Microbiological diagnosis is confirmed by at least 3
consecutive early-morning urine samples showing acid-fast bacilli using Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) stain and subsequently cultured (gold standard).



GUTB is treated with a short course of anti-tubercular therapy (ATT). Ureteric strictures require double J stenting or percutaneous nephrostomy. Definitive treatment is after 3-6mn ofATT,
where a reconstructive procedure (open surgical repair &gt; balloon dilatation) is performed. In case the kidney is poorly functioning, a nephrectomy is done.


option B: Nephrocalcinosis is the deposition of calcium in the kidney parenchyma or tubules, seen in hypercalcemic conditions like hyperparathyroidism.


option C: staghorn calculus (a triple phosphate stone) is found in urinary tract infections (UTI) by urease-producing pathogens like proteus and is not a cause of sterile pyuria.





option D: psoas calcification is a muscle calcification that develops after acute renal failure and rhabdomyolysis. It is not associated with sterile pyuria.",4912-3067.PNG,A,4927-3074.PNG;4927-3074-1.png;4928-3075.PNG
Q13,A patient was found to have a mass arising from the antrum of the stomach which involves the head of the pancreas and metastasis to the right lobe of the liver. How will you manage this patient?,"a)palliative gastrojejunostomy followed by chemotherapy
b)Radical gastrectomy
c)whipple's procedure
d)Gastrectomy with right hepatectomy","The given clinical scenario of a tumour arising from the pyloric antrum of the stomach which
involves the head of the pancreas with liver metastasis is suggestive of metastatic carcinoma of the stomach and is managed by palliative gastrojejunostomy followed by chemotherapy.
Gastric carcinoma has a higher incidence in Japan and affects men more than women. H.pylori is  a significant association, and other risk factors include smoking and industrial dust ingestion. The most common sites are - the proximal stomach (western countries) and distal stomach (Japan
and the rest of the world).



In the early stages, it usually presents as dyspepsia (non-specific). vomiting and profound weight loss is seen in advanced cases. Endoscopy and biopsy of the lesion (gold standard) are performed to diagnose gastric carcinoma. pre-operative staging is done with contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) of the abdominal/pelvis. The most important prognostic indicators in gastric cancer are - lymph node involvement and depth of tumor invasion.
Gastric carcinoma is treated with surgical resection with lymphadenectomy. Based on the tumor location, different types of gastrectomy and anastomoses can be performed.
• Billroth I gastrectomy - the lower half of the stomach is removed + cut end of the stomach is anastomosed to the first part of the duodenum.
•  Billroth II gastrectomy - two-thirds of the stomach is removed, the duodenal stump is closed and the stomach is anastomosed to the jejunum.
• Roux-en Y gastrojejunostomy - a loop of jejunum is anastomosed to a proximal gastric pouch







other options:
option B: Radical gastrectomy is done in proximal gastric cancer and linitis plastica.
option c: whipple’s procedure is done for gastric carcinoma that has spread to the head of the pancreas. since the patient already has metastases to the liver, this will not be the preferred
option.
option D: Gastrectomy with right hepatectomy is done in gastric cancer that has hepatic metastasis.",,A,4929-3077.PNG;4929-3076.PNG;4930-3078.PNG
Q14,"A patient underwent cholecystectomy for gallstones over 2 years ago. she now presents with symptoms of obstructive jaundice. Investigation reveals a stone in the common bile duct.
what is the stone most likely to be?","a)Primary
b)secondary
c)Tertiary
d)Retained","This patient has a history of cholecystectomy done for gallstones 2 years ago. Thus, in this patient with choledocholithiasis, the stones found in the common bile duct would most likely be primary  stones.
choledocholithiasis or common bile duct stones are classified based on their point of origin:
• primary stones are brown pigment stones that arise de novo in the bile duct and are composed of bile pigments and cholesterol.
• secondary stones (option B) are usually cholesterol stones, which originate in the gall bladder and pass down into the common bile duct. since this patient has already undergone
cholecystectomy more than 2 years ago, secondary stones are unlikely.
• when stones are found in the common bile duct within 2 years of history of cholecystectomy, they are termed retained stones (option D).
• If they are found more than 2 years after cholecystectomy, they are known as recurrent stones (which are mostly primary).
clinical features: Mostly clinically silent, but may present with biliary colic and even obstructive    jaundice. when there is fever, jaundice, and associated right upper quadrant abdominal pain, it is known as charcot’s triad, seen in cholangitis.



Management of choledocholithiasis:
ERCP +/- sphincterotomy followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the most preferred management of choledocholithiasis.
If stones cannot be removed through ERCP and sphincterotomy, then common bile duct
exploration is carried out intraoperatively either in an open procedure or via laparoscopy. A T-tube is left in place after choledochotomy.",,A,
Q15,A 7o-year-old female patient presents with pain in the thigh during walking. Investigation reveals the following finding as given below. what will be the best surgical management?,"a)PTA with stenting
b)Iliofemoral bypass
c)Aortofemoral bypass
d)Aorto-iliac bypass","The symptom of pain in the thigh while walking and the given angiography image showing
common iliac artery obstruction is suggestive of peripheral obstructive vascular disease with
aortoiliac obstruction. The best surgical course, in this case, is to perform an aortofemoral bypass.
Clinical findings of aortoiliac obstruction are :
• Intermittent claudication is the debilitating cramp-like pain felt in the buttocks, leg, and thigh muscles due to reduced blood flow.
• Femoral and distal pulses are absent in both limbs.
• Arterial bruit is heard over the aortoiliac region.
• Impotence (Leriche syndrome) may occur. Buttock claudication is present.
As the disease progresses, rest pain, ulceration, gangrene, and slow capillary refilling may be seen.
CT angiography (CTA) and MR angiography (MRA) are specific investigations. Doppler
ultrasound, duplex scanning, and digital subtraction percutaneous angiography (DSA) are the other available investigations.
An aortofemoral bypass is the choice of surgical intervention in aortoiliac obstruction. Dacron graft is a collagen-impregnated, knitted graft that is used to perform the proximal aortic
anastomosis in aortofemoral bypass. It can also be used in aortic valve repair. In unfit patients, axillofemoral bypass may be done.
other options:
option A: Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) is most useful in the treatment of isolated iliac stenoses (&lt;4cm in length) than in occlusive disease.
option B: Iliofemoral bypass is done in patients with unilateral occlusion of the distal common iliac or external iliac arteries.
option D: Aortoiliac bypass more commonly known as the aortoiliac endarterectomy is rarely performed now a days because of greater blood loss associated with this surgery and greater    sexual dysfunction caused, additionally it is difficult to perform.
Note: Aortofemoral bypass surgery has long-term patency of 7o-8o% at 1oyears and is often done bilaterally as the occlusion is more likely to be bilateral with one side affected more severely than  the other. Bilateral aortofemoral bypass does not add to physiological stress and has equal
benefits comparatively.",4913-3068.PNG,C,
Q16,"A young air-hostess presented to the outpatient department with dilated veins on her left leg (image). According to the CEAP classification for varicose veins, what will be the C stage in    this patient?","a)C2A
b)C2s
c)C4a
d)C1","The image above shows dilated, tortuous veins of the lower limb. In asymptomatic patients, they are classified as C2A according to the Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-pathophysiology (CEAp)
classification for chronic venous disorders.
varicose veins are characterized by the tortuous dilatation of subcutaneous veins resulting from
venous insufficiency. patients have heaviness, burning, and aching over the affected area or whole limb, which increases throughout the day or on prolonged standing. Compression and elevation
can relieve the symptoms.
Diagnosed by duplex ultrasound and is treated by modalities such as compression, laser ablation, radiofrequency ablation, endovenous glue, ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy, and open
surgery.

Q17,"An alcoholic patient presented with severe abdominal pain. pancreatitis was suspected and a CT scan revealed lesions with fluid collected near the body of the pancreas. which of the
following enzymes is most likely to be elevated in this scenario?","a)serum GGT
b)CEA
c)serum lipase
d)serum bilirubin","In an alcoholic patient with acute pancreatitis, serum lipase is the enzyme most likely to be elevated.
Acute pancreatitis is often caused by gallstones (7o%) or alcoholism (25%). The cardinal symptom is acute-onset severe pain in the upper quadrant of the abdomen. The patient usually presents in    shock (hypotension and tachycardia) and tachypnoea. some may also present with signs of
bleeding into the fascial planes leading to discoloration of the sites involved:
• cullen’s sign: Around the umbilicus
• Grey Turner’s sign: Flanks
• Fox sign: Inguinal region



• Bryant’s sign: Scrotum
The diagnosis is often clinical with a laboratory diagnosis. Though serum amylase (&gt;3 times) is  indicative of pancreatitis, serum lipase is preferred over serum amylase as it is more sensitive and specific. Contrast-enhanced tomography (CECT) of the abdomen can be used to exclude
pancreatitis if in doubt.
The severity of the acute pancreatitis is assessed using the Ranson and Glasgow scoring system ( ≥3 at 48h of onset of pain ). APACHE, SoFA, SAPS, and MoDS can also be used to assess the      severity of pancreatitis in intensive care (ICU) settings.  Pancreatitis is managed conservatively    with initial nasogastric drainage followed by intravenous fluids, analgesia, and frequent
monitoring of vital signs, urine output, and blood gases.
other options:
option A: Serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) can also be elevated. It is a biomarker for
pancreatic disease and alcohol consumption but is not sensitive and specific to acute pancreatitis.
option B: Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a tumor marker that is elevated in the
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
option D: Elevated serum bilirubin is a result of (i) overproduction of bilirubin (E.g: hemolytic anemia) or (ii) impaired uptake by the liver (liver cirrhosis) or (iii) regurgitation of bilirubin
(obstructive jaundice). It is not seen in acute pancreatitis.",,C,
Q18,A 25-year-old patient presents with abdominal pain and fever for 3 days duration. The chest X-ray in the erect position is given below. what will be the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Gastric volvulus
b)Hollow viscus perforation
c)Liver abscess
d)Empyema thoracis","The given clinical scenario of acute abdominal pain and fever with chest X-ray in an erect position showing air under the diaphragm (pneumoperitoneum) is a characteristic of hollow viscus
perforation.
The most common cause of pneumoperitoneum is bowel perforation (&gt;9o% of the cases).
Gastric and posterior duodenal perforations are seen in long-standing cases of peptic ulcers.
Intestinal perforations are seen with ischemia, inflammation, diverticula, or obstruction (E.g:- colonic carcinoma). other causes also include iatrogenic, penetrating injuries, prolonged
mechanical ventilation, peritoneal dialysis, etc.
Perforation of a viscus is a life-threatening condition due to leakage of the enteric contents which can lead to acute bacterial peritonitis.
Clinical features of hollow viscous perforation are due to the developed peritonitis. They include    abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. on examination, the patient has tachycardia, tenderness,  rebound tenderness, decreased or absent bowel sounds, and guarding on palpation. Fever may be present.
The patient is initially investigated with an upright chest X-ray which typically shows air beneath the diaphragm. various other signs for pneumoperitoneum in the supine abdominal X-rays are     Rigler’s sign, Cupola sign, falciform ligament sign, football sign, and Doge’s cap sign. However,    CECT is the most sensitive investigation to detect minimal/ suspected pneumoperitoneum along   with the cause and site of perforation.





other options:
option A: Gastric volvulus is a twisting or axial rotation of the stomach along its longitudinal axis (organo-axial) or vertical axis (mesentero-axial). The sudden onset of constant and severe upper    abdominal pain, recurrent retching with the production of little vomitus, and the inability to pass an NG tube constitute the Borchardt triad. plain films of the abdomen reveal a gas-filled viscus in the chest or upper abdomen.


option C: Liver abscess will mostly have the classic presenting symptoms of fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain, with a tenderness to palpation. Chest X-ray findings generally reflect subdiaphragmatic diseases, such as an elevated right hemidiaphragm, right pleural effusion, or   atelectasis.
A chest radiograph shows an air-fluid level in the right upper abdomen (arrow) and multiple nodular opacities in the bilateral lungs (arrowheads)





option D: Empyema thoracis is an infection of the pleural space. An empyema thoracis on a chest X-ray can mimic a pleural effusion or a lung abscess.The fluid is commonly drained completely
with a chest tube or small-bore catheter.
