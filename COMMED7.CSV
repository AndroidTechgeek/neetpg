Q5,Monetary benefit is measured in which of the following analyses?,"a)cost effective analysis
b)cost benefit analysis
c)Network analysis
d)Input output analysis","The monetary benefit is measured in a cost-benefit analysis.



In cost-benefit analysis, the economic benefits of any program are compared with the cost of the    program. The benefits are expressed in monetary terms to determine whether a given programme is economically sound and to select the best out of several alternate programmes.
The main drawback with this technique is that the benefits in the health field, as a result of a
particular programme, cannot always be expressed in monetary terms. we generally express the benefit in terms of births or deaths prevented, or illness avoided or overcome.
In cost-effective analysis, the benefit is expressed in terms of results achieved. (Eg: number of lives saved or number of days free from disease).
Input-output analysis: how much input is needed to produce a unit amount of output. In the   health field, input refers to all health service activities which consume resources (manpower,  money, materials, and time); and output refers to useful outcomes such as cases treated, lives saved, or inoculations performed.
Network analysis: a network is a graphic plan of all events and activities to be completed in order to reach an end objective.

management?","a)oral amoxicillin for five days
b)urgent referral to the tertiary care centre immediately
c)Administer IV antibiotics and ask the patient to be brought after 24 hours

presence of chest indrawing. The next best step of management is to give oral amoxicillin for five days and send the child home.
This is based on the revised wHO classification and treatment of childhood pneumonia at health facilities. pneumonia with general danger signs like inability to drink, persistent vomiting,
convulsions, lethargic or unconscious, stridor in a calm child or severe malnutrition needs antibiotics with urgent referral to higher centre.

Q18,which of the following compounds is predominantly responsible for the disinfecting property of bleaching powder?,"a)Hypochlorite ion
b)Hydrochloric acid
c)Hypochlorous acid
d)chloride ion","The disinfectant property of bleaching powder is predominantly due to the action of hypochlorous acid. It is 7o-8o times more effective than hypochlorite ions.
