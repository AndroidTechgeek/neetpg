Q1,Identify the pathognomonic structure in the slide given below.,"a)sclerotic body
b)Budding yeast
c)Negri body
d)Asteroid body","The given image shows the presence of brown round sclerotic bodies which is characteristically seen in chromoblastomycosis.
chromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It is
caused by pigmented fungi (most commonly by phialophora verrucosa) and is commonly seen in tropical areas among agricultural workers and woodcutters who walk barefoot.
patients present with warty cutaneous nodules (cauliflower-like) on the feet and lower legs.
Diagnosis is by demonstration of sclerotic bodies in tissue sections. sclerotic bodies appear as
round or irregular, dark brown bodies with septae. It is usually seen in clusters of 4-8 cells due to septation in different planes and delayed separation.
chromoblastomycosis is managed by:
• First-line treatment involves itraconazole (1oo-2oomg daily) or terbinafine (25omg daily)
• second-line treatment includes the use of cryotherapy or the local application of heat by heat-retaining gels for a period of 2-3 months.
• surgery is only indicated in very small lesions and should always be combined with chemotherapy
• Flucytosine can also be used in combination with amphotericin B, but should not be used alone due to the development of resistance.
other options:
option B - The below image shows multiple round or oval-shaped yeast cells, pseudohyphae, and buds attached to the parent cell. They are seen in budding yeast.


option c - Negri bodies are pathognomonic of rabies. It is an acidophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusion body with characteristic basophilic inner granules as shown below.



option D - Asteroid bodies is seen in sporotrichosis, caused by sporothrix schenckii. It can be seen as an oval, basophilic structure with eosinophilic radiation. These are depositions of
antigen-antibody complexes.",1570-988.PNG,A,1592-1009.PNG;1593-1011.PNG;1593-1010.PNG
Q2,Antigen binding to MHC class I activates which of the following cells?,"a)Cytotoxic T cells
b)B cells
c)NK cells
d)Helper cells","Antigen binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I activates cytotoxic T cells.
The major histocompatibility complex (MHC), is a genetic locus that encodes a group of antigens. The MHC molecules also bind peptide antigens and present them to the T cells. The human MHC is called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex.
The MHC class I proteins present their antigens to CD8 T cells (cytotoxic T cells). The antigens bound to MHC class II proteins activate the CD4 T cells( T helper cells). There is no cross

recognition between the T cells and MHC classes. This is known as MHC restriction. For example, a CD4 T cell would recognize an antigen presented by a macrophage only if it's bound to MHC
class II molecules.
other options:
option B - B cells interact with an antigen based on the immunoglobulin surface receptors on the  B cell. The receptor along with the antigen is embodied and degraded and the peptides produced   are returned to the cell surface. It is then bound to the MHC class II molecules present on the cell  surface. This is then recognized by CD4 T cells. ultimately, the B cells are stimulated to proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells which secrete antibodies.
option C - Natural killer (NK) cells are granular lymphocytes that confer innate immunity by protecting against viruses and intracellular pathogens.
option D - T helper cells are responsible for the production of cytokines which activate the
humoral and cell-mediated branches of immunity. These cells will recognize only those antigens that are presented along with MHC class II molecules on APC such as macrophages and B
lymphocytes.",,A,
Q3,which of the following agents can be used as a disinfectant but not a sanitizer?,"a)Hydrogen peroxide
b)penicillin
c)Methyl paraben
d)Bleaching powder","Hydrogen peroxide is a disinfectant but cannot be used as a sanitizer.
sanitization is a process by which levels of pathogenic organisms on inanimate surfaces are brought down to reduce the chances of cross-infection.
Disinfection is a process by which all pathogenic organisms are destroyed.
sterilization is a process in which all microorganisms in both vegetative and spore state are eliminated from a surface or medium.
Hydrogen peroxide can be used for disinfection or sterilization in the liquid form for cystoscopes,  endoscopes, tubings, and metal instruments. The gaseous form can be used for fogging, which has largely replaced fumigation. It has a shorter cycle time and is non-toxic. The mechanism of
bactericidal action is the oxidation of the cell wall of the microbe. It is also used in plasma sterilization.
other options:
option B - Penicillin, an antibiotic interferes with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. It is not used as a disinfectant or sanitizer.
option C - Methyl parabens are antimicrobials that are commonly used in food and personal care products.
option D - Household bleaching powder (sodium hypochlorite) is a widely used disinfectant in     hospitals. They are oxidizing agents that interfere with cellular protein activity. Diluted solutions are also used for sanitizing surfaces.",,A,

Q5,which of the following is wrong regarding primary and secondary immune response ?,"a)1
b)2
c)3
d)4","statement 4 is wrong regarding primary and secondary immune responses. primary immune response has lower antibody affinity and vice versa.
An immune response is a specific reactivity that occurred in a host as a result of an antigenic
stimulus. It is of two types: Humoral or antibody-mediated response and cellular or cell-mediated response.
The response to the antigenic stimulus can be primary or secondary. The features of the primary and secondary immune responses are as follows

Features	primary immune response	secondary immune response
1. Lag period	4-1o days	1-3 days
2. peak response tim e	7-1o days	3-5 days
3. Antibody respons e	Depends on the antigen	More potent than the primar y immune response
4. Isotype generate	IgM	IgG
5. Antigens	Both thymus-dependent and independent	Depends only on the thymus
6. Antibody affinity	Lower	Higher",,D,
Q6,which of the following is true about anti-CMV IgG antibodies?,"a)Denotes latent CMV infection
b)Denotes chronic CMV infection with immunity to other serotypes
c)Indicates acute CMV infection
d)IgG avidity assay helps in differentiating past and primary infection","IgG avidity assay helps in differentiating past and primary infection with cytomegalovirus (CMv).
Avidity level measured by avidity index is used to describe the percentage of IgG bound to the
antigen after being treated with denaturing agents.These assays are based on the fact that low
avidity IgG antibodies are present during the first few months after the infection and avidity
increases over time indicating maturation of the immune response. so the presence of high avidity IgG denotes a past infection rather than a primary one. Low avidity IgG signals a primary

infection within the last 3-4 months.
IgM detection can be used as an indicator of acute infection, but it lacks specificity for primary infection. This is because it persists for years in some individuals and is also produced during   reactivation.
cytomegalovirus is a type of herpes virus, which causes severe disease in immunocompromised    patients. In most other cases, it is inapparent and marked by prolonged latency with intermittent reactivation.",,D,
Q7,which of the following is an example of Mollicutes?,"a)ureaplasma urealyticum
b)orientia tsutsugamushi
c)chlamydophila pneumoniae
d)chlamydia trachomatis","ureaplasma urealyticum belong to the class Mollicutes which are also known as cell-wall-free bacteria. This class contains around 2oo species of mycoplasma.
Mycoplasma are the smallest microorganisms that can thrive in a cell-free medium. They are pleomorphic and lack cell walls. There are 4 species that are of importance in humans.
• ureaplasma urealyticum

Q9,A patient presents to you with left-sided flank pain. A cT scan was done which is shown below. which of the following statements is incorrect regarding the condition?,"a)Albendazole can be started preoperatively
b)cyst contents can produce anaphylactic reaction
c)A segmented dog tapeworm is the causative agent
d)FNAc or biopsy to be done before nephrectomy","FNAC or biopsy to be done before nephrectomy is the incorrect statement regarding cystic echinococcosis. The given CT image shows left-sided renal hydatid cyst.
Echinococcosis (hydatidosis) is caused by Echinococcus granulosus (larval stage). It is a
segmented tapeworm. Dogs are the definitive hosts and pass the eggs in their feces. Intermediate hosts include humans, sheep, and cattle. patients present with abdominal pain, palpable mass,
jaundice, cough, and dyspnea. Rupture of a hydatic cyst can result in fever, pruritus, or anaphylaxis.
Daughter cysts within the larger cyst seen on CT imaging is diagnostic. A biopsy is not
recommended because of the risk of fluid leakage which can result in anaphylaxis or
dissemination of the infection.

percutaneous aspiration, infusion of scolicidal agents, and reaspiration (pAIR) is the primary
treatment. It is contraindicated in superficial loculated cysts and in cysts that communicate with the biliary tree.
Isolated involvement of the kidneys is rare. patients can present with nonspecific symptoms, renal colic, and hydatiduria. Due to the lack of an effective systemic scolicidal agent, surgical treatment  is necessary when kidneys are involved. simple excision of the cyst is preferred. If there is
extensive involvement, partial or total nephrectomy is warranted. It is recommended to start albendazole one week to one month before the surgery to decrease the risk of spillage.",1573-990.PNG,D,

detected in human and animal sera. It is transmitted by hyalomma ticks.
other options:
option A - yellow fever is mostly confined to the south and central America, and certain parts of Africa. It is caused by the flavivirus. It is an arthropod-borne hemorrhagic fever. In the urban
cycle, Aedes aegypti transmits the disease.
option c - Ebola virus causes a hemorrhagic fever first reported in sudan and zaire. A recent outbreak was reported in west Africa.
option D - Hendra virus was responsible for the death of many horses in Australia.",,B,
Q11,which of the following are acid-fast staining organisms?,"a)1, 2, 3, 4, 5
b)1, 2, 4, 5
c)1, 2, 3
d)3, 4, 5","Nocardia, Mycobacterium leprae, cryptosporidium parvum, and cytoisospora belli (options 1, 2,
4, and 5) are acid-fast staining organisms.
Acid-fast staining is based on the principle that tubercle bacilli resist decolorization with acids   after staining with aniline dyes. Acid fastness is attributed to the variety of fatty acids, alcohols, and lipids in the tubercle bacilli. Acid-fast organisms usually contain mycolic acid, which is
acid-fast in the free state.  The steps to carry out acid-fast staining as modified by ziehl and Neelson are:
• The slide is stained with carbolfuchsin along with the application of heat.
• It is then decolorized with 20% sulphuric acid. Later methylene blue is used for counterstaining.
• The acid-fast bacteria retain the fuchsin color, while other organisms take up the counterstain.
The genus Nocardia are aerobic organisms and weakly acid-fast positive rods. They stain with carbolfuchsin and retain it when 1-4% sulfuric acid is used.



Mycobacterium leprae, the causative agent of leprosy is a gram-positive bacillus. It is acid-fast when 5% sulphuric acid is used instead of 2o%.


cryptosporidium parvum, commonly causes diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals. The oocysts in the stool can be visualized by modified ziehl-Neelsen staining. It appears as red
acid-fast spheres. It can also be used for specimens such as sputum and bronchial wash.



Isospora belli is a coccidian parasite that can cause protracted diarrhea in immunocompromised patients. Modified ziehl-Neelsen staining reveals pink-colored acid-fast oocyst in stool samples.


Actinomyces are gram-positive, anaerobic, and filamentous bacteria that are non-acid-fast in contrast to Nocardia.",,B,1585-1002.PNG;1599-1013.PNG;1600-1015.PNG;1600-1014.PNG;1601-1016.PNG
Q12,The cell wall depicted below is most likely to belong to which of the following organisms?,"a)Aspergillus fumigatus
b)Mycobacterium tuberculosis
c)Mycoplasma pneumoniae
d)Rhinosporidium seeberi","The organism most likely to have the cell wall depicted is Aspergillus fumigatus.
Fungi usually have a rigid cell wall composed of polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and lipids. Most of them contain sugar polymers such as chitin, glucans, and mannans. The cytoplasmic
membrane is usually composed of sterols. Antifungals such as amphotericin and nystatin bind to the ergosterol in the cell membranes which results in membrane damage and leakage.
Aspergillus fumigatus is a filamentous fungi, with hyphae that may have cross-walls or septa. It    can cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, aspergilloma, and superficial infections of the ear, eye, and sinuses. It causes invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised individuals.
other options:
option B - Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are acid-fast staining bacteria, owing to the mycolic acid in the cell wall. They have a three-layered cell wall enclosing a trilaminar plasma membrane.
option C - Mycoplasma pneumoniae lacks cells wall or even cell wall precursors. They are bound by a trilaminar membrane that contains sterols.
option D - Rhinosporidium seeberi causes a granulomatous condition known as rhinosporidiosis.  It exists as a trophocyte with clear cytoplasm and a covering of chitin. Mature trophocytes develop into sporangium with an outer chitinous and inner cellulose layer.",1574-992.PNG,A,
Q13,The organism with following life cycle is:,"a)strongyloides stercoralis
b)Ancylostoma duodenale
c)Ascaris lumbricoides
d)Enterobius vermicularis","The given life cycle is of strongyloides stercoralis.
The organism has a parasitic cycle and a free-living soil cycle. Humans are the natural host but morphologically indistinguishable strains may be seen in dogs and cats.

Filariform larvae are the infective form and there are two modes of infection:
• penetration of skin by 3rd stage filariform larva.
• Autoinfection (external and internal).
The female worms present in the intestine lays eggs in the mucosa which hatches immediately, releasing the rhabditiform larva. The larva migrates into the lumen of the intestine and passes  down to be released in the feces. The rhabditiform larva may change into filariform larva while passing through the bowel.
The filariform larvae in the bowel do not leave the host and become a source of autoinfection as they penetrate the colonic mucosa or perianal skin.
The rhabditiform larvae passed in the feces may undergo two types of development in the soil:
• Direct development: The rhabditiform larva moults twice on reaching the soil to become the infective filariform larva. The filariform larva can penetrate the skin and enter the circulation.
• Indirect development: The rhabditiform larvae develop into free-living males and females in the soil.
other options:
option B: Humans are the only natural host and the life-cycle ofAncylostoma duodenale is
completed in a single host. The eggs laid by the female worms in the intestine are passed in feces. The embryo develops inside the egg and a rhabditiform larva hatches out in about 2 days.
The rhabditiform larva moults twice to form the filariform larva (infective stage). It penetrates the skin and enters the subcutaneous tissue.
option C: Humans are the only natural host for Ascaris lumbricoides and have no intermediate host. The infection is acquired by ingestion of embryonated eggs (infective stage).
option D: Enterobius vermicularis completes its entire life cycle in the human host and has no
intermediate host. Embryonated eggs are the infective form. Infection is acquired by ingestion of the eggs. Autoinfection and retroinfection are seen.",1574-991.PNG,A,
Q14,what is the ratio of T cells to B cells in a healthy adult?,"a)1:1
b)3:1
c)1:2
d)1:3","The ratio of T cells to B cells in the blood of a healthy adult is approximately 3:1.
T lymphocytes constitute 6o-7o% of lymphocytes in the blood while mature B cells account for 1o-2o%.
T cells are of three types: Helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and regulatory T cells. T lymphocytes develop in the thymus.
B lymphocytes develop from precursors present in the bone marrow. They differentiate to form either plasma cells or memory B cells. plasma cells produce antibodies after stimulation by the  antigen.
Lymphocyte recirculation is particularly important for T cells, as B cells do not have to move to the site of infection as the antibodies produced are circulated through blood.",,B,
Q15,"A microbiologist stained a tissue sample and found thin, filamentous bacteria, which  resembled Nocardia sp. what other staining technique should be done to confirm the presence of Nocardia?","a)ziehl-Neelsen staining
b)silver impregnation
c)Albert stain
d)Modified acid-fast stain","The presence of Nocardia species can be confirmed using a modified acid-fast stain.
For microscopy, sputum smears are most commonly used. Nocardia species are seen
as filamentous organisms, with hyphae-like branching. These bacteria are gram-positive and catalase positive, and they produce urease.
The image below shows acid-fast staining of Nocardia.


on direct microscopy of sputum or pus samples, crooked, branching, beaded filaments are seen; these filaments are 1 μm wide and up to 5o μm long.
After incubation at 35–37°c in laboratory media, they develop heaped, irregular, waxy colonies.
strains may vary in their pigmentation from white to orange to red. Blood cultures may be used to detect Nocardia species, although it may take up to 2 weeks to detect growth.",1575-993.PNG,D,1585-1002.PNG
Q16,"what is the microscopy technique to produce high contrast image of transparent, live bacteria?","a)phase contrast microscopy
b)Dark field microscopy
c)Electron microscopy
d)polarized microscopy","The microscopy technique used to produce high contrast images of transparent, live bacteria is phase contrast microscopy.
It improves the contrast by making use of the difference in thickness or refractive index of
structures within and around the cell. The rays passing through different refractive indices are varied by fraction of wavelength, producing a phase difference. This creates a difference in
intensity of light, producing contrast and making the structures within the cells and its
surroundings clearly visible.
option B: In Dark field microscope only the reflected light enters the objective lens whereas the unreflected light does not. Hence the specimen gets brightly illuminated against a dark
background. It is used for visualizing very slender, live organisms such as spirochetes which are not visible under ordinary illumination.

option C: Electron microscopy uses a beam of electrons instead of the beam oflight. It is used for studying dead and dried objects. Hence, it may lead to distortion in cell morphology.
option D: polarized microscopy is used to study the intracellular structures using differences in birefringence.",,A,
Q17,Match the following.,"a)A-4, B-1, C-3, D-2
b)A-4, B-1, C-2, D-3

d)A-2, B-1, C-3, D-4","The correct pairs are as follows:
Tuberculosis: Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be stained with Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain. steps involved in the ZN stain:
• place the sample on the slide and evenly spread it with rotational movement.
• Air-dry the slide, and fix it by passing it over a flame.
• Apply carbol fuchsin stain.
• Heat the underside of the slide until steam rises.
• wash with water to remove excess stain.
• Decolorize with alcohol.
• Apply methylene blue stain.
• wash with water to remove excess stain.
• view under a microscope.
Malaria: Giemsa stain is used as a gold standard procedure for the detection of malarial parasites. This stain helps visualize Maurer's clefts associated with plasmodium falciparum and schuffner's   dots associated with plasmodium vivax or plasmodium ovale.
Leprosy: Acid fastness in general is related to the carbon chain length of the mycolic acid found in any particular species. Acid and alcohol fastness of the lepra bacilli is less than that of the tubercle bacilli. Fite-Faraco method is the staining procedure of choice in Mycobacterium leprae. In this
method, alcohol is eliminated from the hydrating and dehydrating steps, and 1o% sulphuric acid is used as a decolorizer in place of acid/alcohol solution.
Actinomycosis: Actinomyces is a gram-positive bacillus that is filamentous and non-sporing in nature, and the Gram stain is more sensitive in its diagnosis than culture.

b)cyclospora
c)cryptosporidium
d)Microspora","The given clinical scenario and the stool microscopy show oocysts of Cryptosporidium.
Cryptosporidium is a coccidian parasite implicated in causing traveller's diarrhea in
immunocompromised patients. The two cryptosporidium species responsible are C. hominis and
C. parvum.
The infective form is the oocyst excreted in the patient's feces, which can be acquired through drinking water or recreational water activities. The oocysts are immediately infectious (unlike isospora oocysts, which require maturation), and may cause autoinfection.
Because of their small size, they are difficult to see using routine staining and hence, acid-fast staining is done.
once ingested, the 4 sporozoites are released from each cyst and attach to the small intestinal mucosa. It causes crampy abdominal pain and non-inflammatory watery diarrhea.
Treatment is mainly supportive, though nitazoxanide has been approved for use in

Q30,Delayed hypersensitivity is due to ______.,"a)Interferon gamma
b)Interleukin-2
c)Interleukin-12
d)Interleukin-4","Delayed hypersensitivity is due to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma).

Delayed hypersensitivity is also called cell-mediated/type 4 hypersensitivity reaction. It is mediated by T cells and occurs by 2 mechanisms:
• CD4+ T helper cells mediated
• CD8+ T helper cells mediated
CD4+ T helper cells mediated pathway:
Antigen peptides recognized by CD4+ T cells secrete interluekin -2. Interleukin -2 helps in further proliferation of T cells that respond to the antigen peptide. These T cells differentiate into Th1 or   Th17 cells as a result of the cytokines produced from the antigen presenting cells (APC).
APCs also secrete interleukin - 12 which enhances differentiation of the T cells to the Th1 subset. Inflammatory cytokines like interluekins -1, 6, 23 induce differentiation of T cells to the Th17
subset. These responses lead to the release of interferon gamma that alters the macrophages in several ways to ensure eliminating the antigen.
Interferon-gamma-induced changes in the macrophages:
• Augmented ability of the macrophages to phagocytose and kill micro-organisms.
• Increased expression of class 2 MHC molecules to enhance antigen presentation.
• Increased secretion in presence of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and other inflammatory chemokines.
• Amplification of the Th1 response by producing more interleukin-12.
CD8+ T helper cells mediated pathway:
CD8+ T cells destroy antigen-presenting target cells using perforins and granzymes. These
mediators are preformed in the lysosomes of a cell. The perforin-granzyme complex enters the   target cell by endocytosis. Granzymes cause the activation of caspases inducing apoptosis of the target cell. CD8+ T cells also produce interferon gamma following viral infections and contact     allergens. Interferon-gamma then proceeds to stimulate the production of inflammatory
mediators and bring about the hypersensitivity reaction.
Examples of delayed hypersensitivity reactions include the tuberculin reaction and contact dermatitis.
Interferon-gamma is an important effector involved in both immune mechanisms of delayed hypersensitivity reactions and hence is the best answer for this question.",,A,

Q37,which of the following is a gram-positive organism that shows the following appearance on ziehl-Neelsen staining?,"a)Nocardia
b)Mycocbacterium tuberculosis
c)Mycobacterium leprae
d)Actinomyces","The image showing filamentous, branching acid-fast rods is suggestive of Nocardia.
Nocardia appears as filamentous organisms with extensive hyphae-like branching. They are
gram-positive, catalase-positive, and produce urease. They are weakly acid-fast because they stain with carbolfuchsin (routine acid-fast stain) and retain when decolorized with 1-4% sulfuric acid      instead of the stronger acid-alcohol decolorant.
Acid-fast staining is based on the principle that tubercle bacilli resist decolorization with acids   after staining with aniline dyes. Acid fastness is attributed to the variety of fatty acids, alcohols, and lipids in the tubercle bacilli. Acid-fast organisms usually contain mycolic acid, which is
acid-fast in the free state.  The steps to carry out acid-fast staining as modified by ziehl and Neelsen are:
• The slide is stained with carbolfuchsin along with the application of heat.
• It is then decolorized with 2o% sulphuric acid. Later methylene blue is used for counterstaining.
• The acid-fast bacteria retain the fuchsin color, while other organisms take up the counterstain.
other options:
option B: The image given below is a smear with ziehl-Neelsen staining showing non-branching and acid-fast Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli.


option C- Mycobacterium leprae bacilli are less acid and alcohol fast than the tubercle bacillus;   therefore, alcohol is removed from the hydrating and dehydrating steps and 5% sulphuric acid is used as a decolorizer in place of acid/alcohol solution. The image below shows Mycobacterium      leprae on ZN staining.

polyarthropathy occurs in ~5o% of adults infected with parvovirus B19 who are healthy without    underlying sLE. Although parvovirus B19 sometimes mimics rheumatoid arthritis with detectable rheumatoid factor, it has not shown any significant association with sLE.
parvovirus B19 infection occurs usually in children 5–1o years causing erythema infectiosum. It is also known as fifth disease. It begins as a prominent erythema of the cheeks- slapped cheek
disease, spreading to the trunk and limbs, followed by lymphadenopathy and arthralgia. Fever and mild constitutional symptoms may accompany the rash.
parvovirus B19 replicates in immature erythroid cells and causes a transient aplastic crisis in cases of chronic hemolytic anemia, such as sickle cell disease, thalassemias, and acquired
hemolytic anemias in adults.
similarly, infection during pregnancy targets fetal red blood cells causing hemolysis leading to hydrops fetalis and/or fetal loss. since the hydrops is not caused by antigen-antibody
incompatibility, it is termed as non-immune hydrops.
