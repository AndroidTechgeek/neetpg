b) Tetracyclines
c) carbapenems

Question 7,"A patient presents to the emergency department with diarrhea, sweating, excessive lacrimation, and salivation. His pulse rate is 55/min and his plasma cholinesterase level was 5ou/mL. which of the following can be used to treat this patient?","a) Neostigmine
b) Atropine
c) Epinephrine
d) Benztropine","The clinical features are suggestive of organophosphate poisoning and IV atropine is the treatment of choice.
The organophosphates commonly used as pesticides are anticholinesterases. Toxicity occurs by excessive inhalation of vapors, ingestion, or percutaneous absorption. It inhibits the cholinesterase activity which results in an increase of acetylcholine, leading to cholinergic symptoms.
The predominant initial signs are of muscarinic excess which includes: (DUMBBELSS)
• Diarrhea
• Urination
• Miosis
• Bronchospasm
• Bradycardia
• Emesis
• Lacrimation
• Salivation
• Sweating
This may be followed by cognitive disturbances, convulsions, and neuromuscular blockade.
Treatment:
• Maintenance of vital signs particularly respiration
• Removal of clothing and washing of the skin
• IV atropine 2- 5 mg. If IV administration is not possible, then 2 mg IM every 5-1o minutes (till muscarinic symptoms disappear)
• pralidoxime, a cholinesterase reactivator can also be used for treatment",,B,
Question 8,what is pegloticase used for?,"a) chronic gout
b) Rheumatoid arthritis
c) psoriatric arthritis
d) paralytic ileus","pegloticase is used in the treatment of chronic gout.
pegloticase is a pegylated uricase (urate oxidase). It catalyzes the enzymatic oxidation of uric acid into allantoin, which is a more soluble and inactive metabolite.
It is used in the treatment of severe, refractory chronic gout or in cases where other urate-lowering therapies are contraindicated.",,A,
Question 9,which of the following GpcRs does not act via the K+ channel?,"a) Angiotensin 1 receptor
b) Muscarinic M2 receptor
c) Dopamine D2 receptor
d) serotonin 5 HT1 receptor","Angiotensin 1 receptor acts via ca2+ channels. It does not act through second messengers via the K+ channel.
G-protein coupled receptors activate inwardly rectifying potassium channels and increase the permeability of the potassium ions causing hyperpolarisation of the cell. They are called G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs). These receptors include:
• M2 muscarinic
• A1 adenosine
• α2 adrenergic
• D2 dopamine
• 5HT1 serotonin
• Somatostatin receptors.",,A,

b) sacubitril
c) Metoprolol
d) Nesiritide","Trimetazidine is not used in heart failure.
Trimetazidine is a newer antianginal drug that is a pFOX inhibitor which partially inhibits the fatty acid oxidation pathway in the myocardium. This decreases the oxygen requirement of the heart.
Nesiritide (natriuretic peptide), sacubitril (neprilysin inhibitor) and metoprolol (beta-blocker) are used in the treatment of heart failure.",,A,
Question 11,which of the following causes an increase in Ach release from the presynaptic neuron?,"a) potassium channel blocker
b) sodium channel blocker
c) calcium channel blocker
d) chlorine channel blocker","potassium channel blockers cause an increase in Ach release from the presynaptic neuron.
presynaptic potassium channel block promotes the activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. This leads to a release of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction.
Aminopyridines (k+ channel blockers) are used in the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome which helps to improve muscle strength.",,A,
Question 12,"Apart from mu-opioid receptors, on which other receptor does tramadol act?","a) Anticholinergic
b) 5HT1a inhibition
c) serotonergic and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition
d) Antihistaminic","Tramadol inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, apart from its action on the mu-opioid receptor.

Tramadol is a centrally acting analgesic used in the treatment of mild to moderate pain.",,C,
Question 13,In which of the following conditions is non-pulsatile dosing of GnRH agonist not used?,"a) Male infertility
b) Endometriosis
c) precocious puberty
d) prostate cancer","pulsatile dose of GnRH agonist is used in the treatment of male infertility.
pulsatile administration of GnRH agonists results in increased FSH and LH secretion and is used to treat male and female infertility.
Non-pulsatile or continuous dose of GnRH agonist results in suppression and decreased concentrations of gonadotropins LH and FSH. They are used in:
• Endometriosis

Question 17,Tafenoquine is used in which of the following conditions?,"a) Radical cure of plasmodium vivax
b) prophylaxis of malaria in pregnancy
c) Treatment of severe falciparum malaria
d) Treatment of malaria in children <2 years","Tafenoquine is used in the radical cure of Plasmodium vivax. Total eradication of plasmodium species which includes clinical curative and hypnozoites phase are called radical cure.

Question 18,which is not given in wilson's disease?,"a) zinc
b) penicillamine
c) calcium citrate
d) Trientine","calcium citrate is not used in the treatment of wilson's disease.
The drugs used in the management of wilson's disease are:
chelating agents: These drugs bind to copper to form complexes that get excreted in the urine. D-penicillamine and trientine are first-line drugs in symptomatic patients with hepatic diseases.
• D-penicillamine: It is the recommended drug due to its availability and cost-effectiveness as compared to trientine. since it is an antagonist to pyridoxine, supplementation of pyridoxine is required. It can precipitate various adverse effects including aplastic anemia, myasthenia gravis, and membranous nephropathy. It can also worsen neurological symptoms
• Trientine: It is administered in those who cannot tolerate D-penicillamine
• Tetrathiomolybdate: It has been identified to be effective in patients with neuropsychiatric manifestation
Elemental zinc:
• zinc blocks the intestinal absorption of copper by inducing metallothionein (endogenous chelator in enterocytes)
• It is commonly used as a maintenance therapy along with chelating agents. It can also be used as first-line therapy in pregnancy",,C,
Question 19,what dose of epinephrine is used in anaphylactic shock?,"a) 1:1oooo I.V. - 1o ml
b) 1:1ooo I.M. - o.5 ml
c) 1:1ooo I.M. - 1 ml
d) 1:1ooo I.V. - o.5 ml","Epinephrine (1:1ooo solution) o.5 ml via intramuscular route is preferred in the treatment of anaphylactic shock.
For intravenous use, 1:1ooo adrenaline must be further diluted to 1:1o,ooo and should be used very cautiously as slow bolus.
There is a much greater risk of causing harmful side effects by either inappropriate dosage or misdiagnosis of anaphylaxis when using IV adrenaline. Hence, IM injection is preferred over intravenous (IV) bolus because it is faster in many situations and safer (lower risk of cardiovascular complications, such as severe hypertension and ventricular arrhythmias).
For intramuscular, subcutaneous, and inhalational (nebulization) routes of administration, 1:1ooo dilution can be used.
In cardiac arrest, the 1:1ooo adrenaline must be diluted to 1:1o,ooo for IV use. The recommended dose of epinephrine is 1mg 〓 1o mL of 1:1o,ooo solution IV administered every 3 to 5 minutes during resuscitation as per the CPR guidelines.
Epinephrine is also used in the treatment of hypotension, to induce local vasoconstriction to reduce the diffusion of local anaesthetics and to induce bronchodilation in asthma and COPD.",,B,
Question 20,which of the following is true about tedizolid?,"a) Active against gram positive organisms
b) poor oral bioavailability
c) Active against anaerobes
d) causes peripheral neuropathy","Tedizolid is active against gram-positive organisms.
Tedizolid belongs to the class of oxazolidinones. It has poor activity against most gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes. It inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the P site of the 5oS ribosomal subunit.
It is used for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections, respiratory tract infections caused by streptococci, and S. aureus including MRSA.
Common adverse effects include myelosuppression leading to anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia.",,A,
