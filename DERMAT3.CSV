Q1,A 5-year-old boy had painful sores in the mouth with a rash over the hands along with fever. which of these is the causative agent?,"a)Pox virus
b)coxsackievirus
c)HHV-7
d)Parvovirus","The presence of fever, along with painful sores in the mouth and small, tense vescicles with surrounding erythema on the palms and soles in a child point towards the diagnosis of
hand-foot-mouth disease. The most common cause of which worldwide is coxackievirus A16.
spread is by droplets or faecal contamination and the incubation period is 7 days. The fever is
generally mild, and is followed by the appearance of lesions. The characteristic lesions are slightly oval, with a grey blister roof and a narrow rim of erythema. The oral lesions are aphthoid and are  less painful than aphthous ulcers.
only symptomatic treatment is given. The lesions generally disappear in 7 - 1o days.",3550-2224.PNG,B,
Q2,"The following lesion is seen in a 25-year-old man who came to a primary health centre 5 days after he had unprotected sexual intercourse. on palpation the ulcers were painful.
suppurative inguinal lymphadenopathy was present on the right side. The patient has no
previous history of drug allergy. which kit will be used for the management of this particular sexually transmitted disease?","a)kit 6/yellow
b)kit 2/green
c)kit 3/white
d)kit 1/grey","The appearance of painful genital ulcers, along with unilateral suppurative inguinal
lymphadenopathy, 5 days after unprotected sexual intercourse best fits the symptom cluster of a non - herpetic genital ulcer. The treatment of which is kit 3 / white kit in case of no penicillin
allergy.
The above-shown clinical image and the findings are consistent with a diagnosis of chancroid.
soft chancre/chancroid:
• The causative organism is  Haemophilus ducreyi.
• The incubation period is 3 to 1o days.
• It presents with multiple painful ulcers on genitals.
• It may be accompanied by unilateral painful, suppurative inguinal lymphadenopathy.
• Treatment: Inj. Benzathine penicillin 2.4 million units + tab. Azithromycin 1 gm single dose
Note: In the syndromic approach to sexually transmitted infections, kit assignment based on the  identification of a cluster of symptoms rather than making an actual diagnosis is given emphasis.",3551-2225.PNG,C,
Q3,A patient with fever and joint pain developed pigmentation on the nose after a few days of taking NSAIDs as shown below. what is the diagnosis?,"a)Melasma
b)Fixed drug eruption
c)Lichen planus
d)chikungunya","The given clinical history of fever and joint pain and the image showing hyperpigmented macules on nose (chik sign) is suggestive of chikungunya.
post-chikungunya pigmentation (pcp) most commonly affects the nose and cheeks. It often appears as the fever subsides and may persist for about 3-6 months.
pcp mimics melasma and may be misdiagnosed if proper history is not taken.
Another close differential is fixed drug eruptions (FDE). FDE is a type of delayed hypersensitivity reaction. It is characterized by well-defined brown, hyperpigmented plaques that may follow
vesiculobullous lesions. They occur on lips, hands, legs, face, genitalia, and oral mucosa, and can   cause a burning sensation.They usually present 3o min to 8 h after drug exposure and recur at the same location on re-exposure. NsAIDs, paracetamol and co■trimoxazole are the most common



drugs causing FDE.
The image below shows FDE on upper lip area:",3533-2211.PNG,D,3545-2222.PNG
Q4,which cell is not present in the layer marked D?,"a)keratinocyte
b)Merkel cell
c)Melanocyte
d)Langerhans cells","The layer marked as D is stratum basale. Langerhan's cells are not present in stratum basale. Langerhan's cells are predominantly present in stratum spinosum.


keratinocytes, melanocytes, and Merkel discs are all seen in stratum basale:
(option A) keratinocytes are predominant cells of the epidermis and constitute the majority of the stratum basale.
(option B) Merkel discs are type 1 slow-adapting touch receptors.



(option C) Melanocytes are dendritic cells which are derived from the neural crest cells. The    melanosomes synthesized by the melanocytes migrate to the adjacent keratocytes through the dendritic processes",3552-2226.PNG,D,3557-2230.PNG
Q5,Topical steroids are most effective in:,"a)Dermal atrophy
b)Eczematous dermatitis
c)Bullous lesions due to HSV
d)Rosacea","Topical steroids are the drug of choice in the treatment of eczematous dermatitis.
other options:
• steroids cause atrophy and hence is contraindicated in patients with dermal atrophy.
• Herpes infection is associated with immunosuppression so steroids are not useful.
• Routine steroid use not recommended in rosea as it can worsen the condition.",,B,
Q6,"You have ordered a patch test for an 8-year-old boy with a history of allergic contact dermatitis. After the application of the patch, when should you ask him to return for removal?","a)24 hours
b)72 hours
c)48 hours
d)96 hours","In patch testing, the patch is removed after 48 hours to examine the site of reaction.
patch testing is a test to detect sensitivity to a specific allergen. A battery of suspected allergens is applied to the patient’s back under occlusive dressings or patches. It is allowed to remain in
contact with the skin for 48 hours.
• 48 hours:  patch removal for initial reading to detect delayed hypersensitivity reaction.
• 72-96 hours: Final reading done for confirmation.
Note: since the question is regarding the timing of patch removal and not regarding the final diagnosis, 48 hours is the answer.",,C,3558-2231.PNG;3559-2232.PNG
Q7,"A patient was treated with steroids for psoriasis. on stopping the treatment, he develops
fever, malaise, and lesion as seen in the image below. what is the most probable diagnosis?","a)pustular psoriasis
b)staphylococcal infection
c)Acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis
d)subcorneal pustulosis","The given clinical scenario points towards the diagnosis of pustular psoriasis.
pustular psoriasis is a type of psoriasis characterized by tiny pus-filled lesions (pustules) having a characteristic lakes or sheets of pus appearance (seen in the image).
The patient presents with a history of fever and malaise along with the presence of pustules on a circumscribed, fiery red, edematous or scaling plaque. The pus is usually sterile. sudden
withdrawal of systemic steroids is usually the trigger for this condition.
pustular psoriasis can be divided into:
• Localized pustular psoriasis
• Generalized pustular psoriasis:
• Acute generalized pustular psoriasis (von zumbusch)
• subacute annular and circinate pustular psoriasis
• Acute generalized pustular psoriasis of pregnancy (Impetigo herpetiformis)
Treatment: Acitretin (oral retinoid) is the drug of choice for pustular psoriasis. However, it is
contraindicated in pregnancy. systemic steroids are used instead. cyclosporine is the second-line drug.
Note: systemic steroids are never used for the treatment of psoriasis except in the case of Impetigo herpetiformis where they are first-line agents.",3553-2227.PNG,A,

Q9,"A patient presents with flaccid bullous lesions involving the oral cavity and the skin. He has lesions as shown below. Acantholytic cells are seen on Tzanck smear. what is the most
probable diagnosis?","a)pemphigus foliaceus
b)pemphigus vulgaris
c)Dermatitis herpetiformis
d)Bullous pemphigoid","Flaccid lesions, mucosal involvement, and the presence of acantholytic cells are suggestive of pemphigus vulgaris.
option A: There is no mucosal involvement in pemphigus foliaceus.
option C: Dermatitis herpetiformis presents with multiple small vesicles and no acantholysis.
option D: Bullous pemphigoid presents with tense bullae and no acantholysis.",3554-2228.PNG,B,
Q10,"A 1o-year-old child presents with hair loss. The hair loss is patchy as shown in the image
below. Black dots are noted in areas of hair loss. which of the following types of tinea is this child suffering from?","a)Ectothrix
b)Endothrix

Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection primarily occurring in children. Clinical features of tinea capitis are patchy hair loss, scaling, tender lymphadenopathy, and in severe cases, there might be  pustules and crusting of the affected area along with sinus formation.
The clinical variants of tinea capitis are:
• Endothrix - a non-inflammatory type in which multiple black dots are present within the areas of alopecia. It is most commonly caused by T. tonsurans and T. violaceum.
• Ectothrix -a mild inflammatory type in which single or multiple scaly patches with hair loss are seen. Microsporum audouinii, M.canis, M.equinnum, and M.ferrugineum cause ectothrix
infection.
• kerion -a severe inflammatory type that presents with an inflammatory mass with thick crusting and matting of hair with pus and sinus formation. It is commonly caused by T.   verrucosum and T. mentagrophytes.





• Favus - is characterized by the presence of yellowish, cup■shaped crusts known as scutula that develop around hair follicles. It is caused by T. schoenleinii
