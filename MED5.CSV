Q3,what levels of prolactin are definitely suggestive of prolactinoma?,"a)&gt;5oμg/L
b)&gt;1ooμg/L
c)&gt;15oμg/L
d)&gt;2ooμg/L","The diagnosis of a prolactinoma is highly likely when prolactin levels are &gt; 2oo μg/L.
The normal range of serum prolactin (pRL) is 5-2o μg/L. prolactin levels &lt; 1oo μg/L can be due  to non-functioning pituitary adenomas or non-neoplastic causes of hyperprolactinemia. MRI brain must be done in all patients with hyperprolactinemia.
prolactinoma are tumors arising from the lactotroph cells of the pituitary gland, they can be classified as microadenoma(&lt;1cm in diameter, usually non invasive ) or
macroadenoma(&gt;1cm, locally invasive to adjacent structures). clinical features include
amenorrhea, infertility, and galactorrhea in women, impotence, loss of libido, infertility in men and if tumor extends beyond sella, there can be visual field defects and other mass effects.
Treatment - In asymptomatic patients and those where fertility is not desired, they do not require treatment and can be monitored using regular pRL measurements and MRI. In symptomatic
microadenoma cases, oral dopamine agonists (cabergoline and bromocriptine) form the main



treatment for hyperprolactinemia and reduction of tumor volume. For macroadenoma, before
starting dopamine agonists visual field testing is to be done, and reassess it with MRI changes
every 6-12 month intervals until maximum reduction is achieved, in unresponsive cases consider surgery.",,D,

Q8,Low serum copper levels attributed to ATP7A gene is due to:,"a)Dubin-Johnson syndrome
b)wilson's disease
c)Menke's disease
d)Gilbert's syndrome","Low serum copper level attributed to the ATP7A gene is due to Menke's disease (option C).
Menke's disease or Menke-kinky hair syndrome is an X-linked recessive condition occurring due to a mutation in the ATP7A gene on chromosome X. This causes impaired transport of dietary
copper from the small intestine to the liver leading to low levels of copper-containing enzymes. It presents within 3 years of age and is characterized by:
• Depigmented kinky hair
• Failure to thrive
• Neurodegenerative symptoms like loss of developmental milestones, truncal hypotonia, epilepsyLoose, wrinkled skin
• Multiple fractures
• Poor visual acuity
• Recurrent infections.
Lab investigations show low serum copper (&lt;65 μg/dL) and low ceruloplasmin(&lt;2o mg/dl).    The disease is fatal as it has no curative treatment. But, administration of L-histidine and copper chloride injections may be beneficial, if started early.
Aceruloplasminemia is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by tissue iron overload, mental deterioration, microcytic anemia, and low serum iron and copper concentrations.
option B: Low serum copper and low ceruloplasmin is also seen in wilson’s disease, but is
associated with the gene defect ATP7B on chromosome 13. It is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism with features of hepatolenticular degeneration and kayser Fleischer ring.
option A: Dubin Johnson syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired canalicular excretion of bilirubin due to mutation in MRP-2 protein leading to conjugated
hyperbilirubinemia.

b)1o years
c)12 years
d)5 years","The time interval between primary HIv infection and the manifestation of AIDs is 1o years.




After exposure to the HIV virus, there occurs primary infection following an incubation period of 2-4 weeks, which is usually symptomatic in more than 5o% of cases, following 3-6 weeks there is acute HIV syndrome due to wide dissemination of the virus, characterized by fever, sore throat,   diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, and rash.
This peak viremia drops as the immune response develops, to reach a plateau about 3 months later. Following this there is a prolonged period of clinical latency, during which infected
individuals are asymptomatic, lasting for a median of 1o years.
Following this period, chronic persistent infection develops which is the hallmark of HIV disease called Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Q11,Myasthenia gravis is associated with __________.,"a)Decreased acetylcholine release at the nerve endings
b)Decreased myosin
c)Absence of troponin C
d)Decreased synaptic transmission at the myoneural junction","Myasthenia gravis is associated with a decrease in synaptic transmission at the myoneural junction.
Myasthenia gravis is a postsynaptic neuromuscular disorder that is characterized by weakness and fatigability of skeletal muscles. It is due to autoantibody-mediated destruction of the acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). This consequently leads to a decreased    transmission at the neuromuscular (myoneural) junction.
Lambert Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) is a presynaptic disorder of the NMJ that can cause weakness similar to that of Myasthenia Gravis. It is due to autoantibodies directed against
p/Q-type calcium channels at the motor nerve terminals.

b)Beta-thalassemia
c)sickle cell anemia
d)von willebrand disease type 1","The features of multiple episodes of acute severe pain in fingers and toes with spontaneous
resolution are suggestive of dactylitis (hand-foot syndrome), which usually occurs in sickle cell



anemia.
The sickled RBcs have a sticking tendency towards the endothelium of the small venules. These abnormalities provoke unpredictable episodes of vaso-occlusion. Dactylitis is characterized by     severe pain affecting the bones of the hands, feet, or both. It is often the first symptom of sickle cell anemia in children.
Treatment - Administration of patient-controlled analgesia or a frequent fixed dose of opioids with rescue doses for breakthrough pain are preferred with frequent monitoring during the initial
48-72 hrs to prevent unexpected death due to arrhythmias or pulmonary embolism.
other manifestations include:
• splenic autoinfarction - repeated splenic microinfarcts
• Acute splenic sequestration - venous obstruction, needing emergency transfusion/splenectomy
• painful ischemic crises - vaso-occlusion in connective and musculoskeletal tissue
• Renal papillary necrosis leading to isosthenuria
• cerebrovascular strokes

Q14,cryoglobulinemia is associated with _______.,"a)Hepatitis c
b)ovarian cancer
c)Diabetes
d)Leukemia","cryoglobulinemia is associated with hepatitis c infection.
Following Hepatitis c infection, there is an aberrant immune response leading to an immune  complex formation containing hepatitis c antigens, polyclonal IgG specific to Hepatitis c, and monoclonal IgM rheumatoid factor, which triggers an inflammatory cascade results in
cryoglobulinemic vasculitis.
cryoglobulins are the immunoglobulins that precipitate at temperatures less than 37°c, the
presence of these cryoglobulins in serum leads to cryoglobulinemia, which is characterized by
cutaneous vasculitis, palpable purpura, arthritis, peripheral neuropathy, and glomerulonephritis.

c)Liddle's syndrome
d)Fanconi's syndrome","Hypertension with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis is seen in Liddle's syndrome.
Liddle's syndrome (pseudo aldosteronism) is an autosomal dominant condition that is caused due to the increased activation of ENaC channels. This causes increased reabsorption of Na+
exchanged for K+ causing hypokalemia. Increased Na absorption leads to hypertension, and there



is also a loss of H+ ion with K+, leading to metabolic alkalosis. It is associated with low renin and low aldosterone levels.",,C,
Q21,what is the diagnostic test of choice for HIV in a baby born to an HIV-infected mother?,"a)HIV DNA PCR

d)Third generation ELISA","In a baby born to an HIV-infected mother, HIV infection is diagnosed using HIV DNA PCR.
NACO recommends the use of a qualitative HIV-1 DNA PCR (NAT) in children aged &lt;18 months for Early Infant Diagnosis (EID).
Antibody assays (e.g., ELIsA) are not reliable in infants and young children because of the
persistence of transplacentally acquired maternal antibodies. For this reason, HIV virologic
testing must be performed using tests that detect HIV DNA or RNA to diagnose HIV infection in children.
scheduled repeated testing is necessary because test sensitivity increases with time from HIV
virus exposure and very recent infection will not be detectable. The cord blood should not be used for testing because of the possibility of contamination of the sample with maternal blood.",,A,
Q22,which of the following is not a common feature of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis?,"a)Distal bronchiectasis
b)Cough
c)wheezing
d)Raised serum IgE levels","Central bronchiectasis is a typical feature of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), not distal bronchiectasis.
ABPA is an eosinophilic pulmonary disorder caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to the
colonization of airways by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. It occurs almost exclusively in
patients with asthma (~2.5% of patients) or cystic fibrosis (up to 15%). In chronic cases, repeated episodes of bronchial obstruction, inflammation, and mucoid impaction can lead to
bronchiectasis, fibrosis, and respiratory compromise. while central bronchiectasis is
characteristic, some patients can develop chronic cavitary lesions.
with the development of ABPA, asthma or cystic fibrosis typically worsens and may manifest with a new or worsening cough or an increase in sputum production or wheezing. Many patients report coughing up thick sputum casts. The presence of hyperattenuating mucus in the airways is highly  specific.
ABPA is diagnosed serologically, based on the presence of:
serum IgE &gt; 1ooo IU/ml
Positive skin prick test or IgE levels against A. fumigatus extract
Detection of Aspergillus-specific antibodies
Eosinophilia &gt;5oo cells/μL
Treatment - The use of systemic glucocorticoids is indicated for ABPA, but the course should be     tapered by 3-6 months.

Q24,"A middle-aged woman who presented with tremors, palpitations, weight loss, and menstrual irregularities is diagnosed with Graves' disease. which of the following statements would be  correct with respect to her thyroid function test?","a)Low TSH levels
b)Low free T4 levels
c)Low serum T3 levels
d)Radioactive Iodine Uptake (RAIU) at 24 hours below normal","In Graves' disease, the level of serum TSH is low, free T4 is high and serum T3 is high. In patients with thyrotoxicosis, the radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) at 24 hours is characteristically elevated. Grave’s disease is characterized by thyrotoxicosis caused by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins  (TSIs) synthesized by lymphocytes in the thyroid gland, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Thyroid   peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) antibodies are also seen. This results in excess



production of free T3 and free T4 levels and in turn reduces serum TSH levels.
RAIU is used to differentiate Grave’s from other thyroid disorders, here there is diffuse high    uptake. Measurement of TRab and TPos is also done to confirm the diagnosis if the diagnosis clinically is unclear.",,A,4229-2694.PNG
Q25,The observed myocardial stunning pattern does not match the ECG findings of a patient. what is the probable diagnosis?,"a)Takotsubo cardiomyopathy
b)Restrictive cardiomyopathy
c)Brigade's cardiomyopathy
d)pericardial tamponade","Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is the probable diagnosis when the observed myocardial stunning pattern does not match ECG changes.
Myocardial stunning is a state where certain segments of the myocardium (usually corresponding to an area of major coronary occlusion) show forms of contractile abnormality (dysfunction) on     echocardiography.
In Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, while the ECG changes mimic a myocardial infarction(MI), the left ventricular dysfunction extends well beyond the distribution of a specific coronary artery. Thus,    the myocardial stunning pattern might not fully match the ECG. Ventriculography shows apical
dilation with basal contraction.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurs typically in older women and is associated with a sudden increase in emotional or physical stress, presenting with hypotension, chest pain with ECG
changes of acute MI, and pulmonary edema. Its also known as apical ballooning syndrome or acute stress-induced cardiomyopathy.
option B: Restrictive cardiomyopathy is characterized by diastolic dysfunction with reduced
contractility and ejection fraction, most commonly seen in amyloidosis, and enlarged ventricles on imaging with low-voltage ECG complexes.
option C: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a type of familial dilated  cardiomyopathy (DCM), having defects in desmosomal proteins, affecting the ventricles showing thin ventricular walls on Echo, epsilon waves, and low voltage ECG complexes.

d)Emtricitabine","Abacavir is not used in HIV and hepatitis-B co-infection. It is used in the first-line ART regimen for patients with abnormal serum creatinine values.
Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) drugs like lamivudine, its closely related drug  emtricitabine, and the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) tenofovir have activity    against hepatitis B virus. These drugs are preferred in combination with other antiretrovirals for the treatment of HIV &amp; HBV co-infections.",,B,
Q27,who comes under category III non-heart-beating donor?,"a)A patient who died during transportation to the hospital
b)A patient who died after failed resuscitation after reaching the hospital
c)A patient who was brought dead to the hospital
d)A patient who is awaiting death in the hospital","category III donors are patients with non-survivable injuries who have their treatment withdrawn and if such patients wished in life to be organ donors, the transplant team can attend at the time   of treatment withdrawal and retrieve organs after cardiac arrest has occurred.
Modified Maastricht classification- categories of non-heart-beating donors:

category	Description	circumstances
category I	Includesvictims of accident a  nd suicidewho arefound dead at the sceneand resuscitation 	is deemed pointless (e.g. fata l cervical spine fracture).	uncontrolled - transplant tea m not present or prepared
category I I	victims of sudden cardiac or    cerebral catastrophewho are   brought to emergency depart  ments while being resuscitate d by ambulance personnel or  whodied in the department.    other sources include patient s suffering an isolated brain i  njury, anoxia, and stroke, an   d victims of major trauma wh
o died soon after hospital ad mission.	uncontrolled - transplant tea m not present or prepared

Q28,which of the following conditions is associated with AV block?,"a)Hypothyroidism
b)cushing's syndrome
c)Hyperthyroidism
d)pheochromocytoma","Hypothyroidism is associated with AV block. In hypothyroidism, there is reduced myocardial contractility and reduced pulse rate leading to a reduced stroke volume and bradycardia, AV  block.
causes of AV block:
Autonomic:
• carotid sinus hypersensitivity
Metabolic:
• Hyperkalemia
• Hypermagnesemia
• Hypothyroidism
• Adrenal insufficiency
Drug related:
• Beta blockers
• calcium channel blockers
• Adenosine
• Digitalis
• Lithium
• class 1 and class 3 anti arrhythmics
Infections:
• Endocarditis
• Lyme disease



• chaga's disease
• syphilis
• Tuberculosis
• Diphtheria
• Toxoplasmosis
Inflammatory:
• sLE
• RA
• scleroderma
Infiltrative:
• Amyloidosis
• sarcoidosis
• Hemachromatosis",,A,
Q29,which drug is used for mass chemoprophylaxis for meningococcal meningitis?,"a)ciprofloxacin
b)chloramphenicol
c)Tetracycline
d)penicillin","ciprofloxacin is used for chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal meningitis for close contacts.
ceftriaxone and rifampicin are also used.
Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis among close contacts of a patient with invasive meningococcal disease is recommended to prevent secondary cases.
• Rifampin - was earlier used widely, but is not optimal due to the high risk of adverse events, emerging resistance, and the need for compliance for four doses.
• ciprofloxacin - widely used as a single oral dose, but it cannot be given in pregnancy and those below 18 years of age.
• ceftriaxone - can be given in pregnancy and all ages as a single IM or IV dose. However, reduced susceptibility of isolates to ceftriaxone has occasionally been reported.
Recommended chemoprophylaxis for high-risk close contacts for meningococcal meningitis:

patient group	Drug	Age	Dose	Route and duration
Non-pregnant individual s	Rifampi cin	<1 month	5 mg/kg	oral every 12 hrs for 2 da ys
>1 month	1o mg/k g	oral every 12 hrs for 2 da ys		
ciprofloxacin	>18 year s	5oo mg	oral single d ose	
children and pregnant w omen	ceftriax one	<15 years	125mg	IM single dose
> 15 years	25o mg	IM single dose",,A,
