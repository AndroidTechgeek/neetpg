Q1,which of the following is seen in osteoporosis?,"a)Normal calcium and normal ALP
b)Decreased calcium and normal ALP
c)Increased calcium and increased ALP","osteoporosis is associated with normal calcium, normal ALp levels and phosphorous.
osteoporosis is a common metabolic bone disease characterised by a diffuse reduction in bone density due to a decrease in bone mass.
Risk factors for osteoporosis include:
• Increasing age
• Female sex
• Alcohol
• smoking
• previous history of fragility fractures
• Family history of hip fracture
• Low body mass index- less than 18.5 kg/m2
• Excessive usage of glucocorticoids
• They present with fractures that occur without any trauma or as a result of low-impact trauma. The commonly associated fractures are fractures of the distal part of the radius (colle's fracture), fractures of the hip, and fractures of the vertebrae. In severe cases, the fracture of vertebrae can   cause kyphosis.
Radiological findings:
• A decreased vertical height of the vertebra due to collapse
• Ground glass appearance - especially in bones like pelvis
• codfish appearance - it occurs due to bulging of the disc into the adjacent vertebral bodies so that it becomes biconcave
DEXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) is the investigation of choice for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. T-score less than -2.5 in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip indicates
osteoporosis.
Treatment - the mainstay is to reduce the risk of fractures. Following medications can be useful:
• Bisphosphonates. They are the first line of medication. They reduce osteoclastic bone resorption and prevent bone loss. Eg. zoledronate
• Denosumab- This is an antibody to the RANK ligand. It prevents the activation of RANK which is required for the proliferation of osteoclasts. Therefore, it decreases bone resorption
• parathyroid hormone - preotact and teriparatide are recombinant parathyroid hormone analogues. At low and intermittent doses, they can promote bone formation.
• selective estrogen receptor modulators (sERMs)- They act on the estrogen receptors and prevent bone resorption. Eg. raloxifene.
• strontium ranelate- It is thought to increase bone formation and reduce bone resorption.



• cathepsin K inhibitor- inhibits the activity of collagenases (eg, odanacatib)
• sclerostin inhibitor- sclerostin inhibits the activity of osteoblasts. Romosozumab is a humanized antisclerostin monoclonal antibody that increases bone formation.
operative treatment is required for femoral neck and other long bone fractures.",,B,
Q2,A 15-year-old boy was brought to the ER following a motor vehicle collision complaining of pain over the hip. The x-ray is given below. what is the next step of management?,"a)Closed reduction and assessment of hip stability
b)CT pelvis with 3D reconstruction
c)High weight skeletal traction
d)open reduction and reconstruction of posterior pillar of acetabulum","The radiograph shows upward and lateral dislocation of the left femoral head with an obscured lesser trochanter which is suggestive of posterior dislocation of the left hip and the next step in the management is closed reduction and assessment of hip stability.
posterior hip dislocation:
It is commonly seen following dashboard injuries and in this condition, the patient presents with flexion, adduction, and internal rotation deformity of the lower limb.
Radiological findings:
• upward dislocation of the femoral head
• The femoral head appears smaller than normal
• The lesser trochanter is not visualized as the thigh is internally rotated
• The femoral head and posterior acetabular wall fractures may also be seen Treatment:
An early reduction should be done as the risk of osteonecrosis and subsequent osteoarthritis increases with time.
closed reduction under sedation or general anaesthesia is done in most cases. If there is an
associated femoral neck fracture, a closed reduction should not be attempted as it can lead to the displacement of the femoral neck and disrupt the blood supply to the femoral head.
In closed reduction the following steps are done:
The pelvis is kept in a steady position and traction is applied in line of the femur with the knee    flexed at 9o degrees. The hip is then flexed maintaining the traction along with internal rotation and adduction.
After reduction, the stability of the hip is tested by flexing the hip to 9o degrees, and a
longitudinal and posteriorly directed force is applied. while performing this the joint is monitored is an image intensifier to look for any signs of subluxation. If there is evidence of subluxation or     any significant fractures then surgical repair should be done. If there is a delay in surgical
correction, skeletal traction with a distal femoral traction pin can be done.
In case of damage to the acetabulum, or the presence of intervening structures between the femoral head and the acetabular surface open reduction can be considered.
Early complications:
• sciatic nerve injury - It can be damaged in 1o-2o% of the cases
• vascular injury - superior gluteal artery tear can occur



• concurrent femoral shaft fracture - when both occur together hip dislocation may be missed Late complications:
• osteonecrosis of the femoral head
• Myositis ossificans
• secondary osteoarthritis
• Recurrent instability",5309-3359.PNG,A,
Q3,which of the following findings appear late in compartment syndrome?,"a)pallor
b)paralysis
c)pulselessness
d)pain on passive strech","pulselessness is a late sign is compartment syndrome.
Acute compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency caused by increased pressure within a
fascial compartment, leading to tissue ischemia. It is characterized by rapid progression of pain and swelling in an extremity, commonly precipitated by traumatic injury.
The classic features of ischemia in acute compartment syndrome include the 5 p's:
• pain: pain is the first symptom of acute compartment syndrome. Ischemic muscle groups have    an increased sensitivity to touch. on passive stretching of the muscles, severe pain can be elicited.
• paresthesia: paresthesia and hypoesthesia are the first signs of ischemia and may be noted due to compression of nerves traversing the affected compartment.
• pallor: pallor of the skin may not always be seen as ischemia occurs at the capillary level (late sign).
• paralysis: paralysis of muscle groups affected in that compartment (late sign).
• pulselessness: The absence of distal pulses (extremely late sign).
Treatment:
• prompt decompression of the affected compartment is done.
• All the dressings, bandages, and cast on the affected limb are removed and the limb is nursed flat.
• Fasciotomy is done if the differential pressure is less than 3o mm Hg
• Fasciotomy wounds are left open and after 2 days if there is necrosis debridement is done. If the wounds are healthy it can be sutured without tension or skin grafting can be done.
The diagnosis of compartment syndrome can be confirmed by measuring the intra-compartmental pressure using a split catheter introduced into the compartment. The difference between diastolic  pressure and compartment pressure is known as differential pressure (Δp). If the differential
pressure (Δp) is less than 3o mm Hg (4.oo kilopascals), immediate compartment
decompression is indicated.",,C,
Q4,which of the following statements are true about open fractures?,"a)1 and 2
b)1 and 4
c)2 and 4
d)2 and 3","open fractures commonly involve the tibia and phalanges (statement 1) and necessitate early wound debridement (statement 4).
open fractures are characterized by a break in the overlying skin and soft tissues, exposing the
fracture fragment to the external environment. It is important to note that open fractures can be    accompanied by multiple other injuries, and the presence of an open fracture does not exclude the possibility of developing compartment syndrome as a potential complication.
The most common sites involved in open fractures include:
• phalanges (fingers and toes)
• Tibial diaphysis
• Distal radius
• Ankle
Major components of the management of open fractures are:
1) Antibiotic prophylaxis - It should be given as early as possible. co-amoxiclav or cefuroxime are the preferred drugs.
2) Early debridement of the wound and fracture - This includes the following steps:
• Excision of the wound margins.
• Extension of the wound if required.
• Delivery of the fracture outside the wound for proper examination.
• All the devitalized tissue should be removed.
• cleansing of the wound to remove all the foreign materials.
• Nerves and tendons are usually left alone, but if the wound is clean and expertise is available their repair can be considered.
3) Early wound cover:
• In Gustilo type 1 and 2 fractures wound cover can be done at the time of debridement.
• Delayed wound cover is usually practiced in type 3 fractures.
4) Fracture stabilization:
• The method of fracture stabilization depends on the degree of contamination, amount of soft tissue damage, and time from injury to operation.
• External fixation is used as a temporary measure if there is a delay in wound cover.
• If definitive wound cover can be achieved at the time of debridement and there is no significant contamination, then an open fracture can be managed as same as a closed injury.",,B,
Q5,An old lady slipped and fell at home. she was diagnosed with a Colles' fracture and managed with a pop cast. what is the correct sequence of reduction?,"a)Traction, pop, palmar flexion, ulnar deviation
b)Traction, palmar flexion, ulnar deviation, pop
c)Traction, ulnar deviation, palmar flexion, pop
d)palmar flexion, ulnar deviation, traction, pop","The correct order of reduction of colles' fracture is traction, palmar flexion, ulnar deviation, pop.



colle's fracture refers to the extra-articular fracture of the distal radius with dorsal angulation of the distal bone fragment.
Displacements that may be seen in colles' fracture are:
• Impaction of fragments
• Dorsal tilt
• Dorsal displacement
• Lateral tilt (radial tilt)
• Lateral displacement (radial displacement)
• supination
The patient usually presents with pain, swelling, and deformity of the wrist. There may be a
typical 'dinner-fork deformity' where the radial styloid process comes to lie at the same level or a little higher than the ulnar styloid process. A dorsal tilt is characteristic and is seen on a lateral
x-ray.
Management of colles' fracture:
• undisplaced fractures: immobilization in a below-elbow plaster cast for 6 weeks
• Displaced fractures: closed manipulative reduction and immobilization in colles' cast. The technique of reduction of colles' fracture is as follows:
• Dis-impaction of the fracture fragments by longitudinal traction against counter traction provided by the assistant.
• The distal fragment is then pressed into palmar flexion followed by ulnar deviation.
• The patient's hand is drawn into pronation, palmar flexion, and ulnar deviation.
• A colles' cast is then applied, extending from below the elbow to the metacarpal heads, with the wrist in palmar flexion and ulnar deviation.
• surgical correction is advisable for comminuted fractures, especially in young adults where the dominant hand is involved. It can be with percutaneous K-wire fixation, external fixators, or
locking compression plates.
complications:
• stiffness of joints - finger stiffness is commonly seen
• Malunion - can produce dinner-fork deformity
• subluxation of the inferior radio-ulnar joint
• carpal tunnel syndrome - uncommon
• sudek's osteodystrophy - colles' fracture is the commonest cause of this condition in the upper limb.
• Rupture of extensor pollicis longus tendon - extremely rare",,B,5351-3393.PNG

• Jones fracture - 5th metatarsal
• Bennett's fracture - 1st metacarpal
• March fracture - 2nd metatarsal
• Boxer fracture - 5th metacarpal
Jones fracture - It refers to the fracture of the proximal part of the fifth metatarsal at the
metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction. It is usually caused by an adduction injury of the forefoot.  Conservative management is done with a short-leg non-weight bearing cast for a period of 6  weeks. surgical correction by intramedullary screw fixation is advocated for faster healing in highly active individuals.





Bennett's fracture - It occurs at the base of the first metacarpal bone. It is sustained usually by a fall or during punching. The fracture line is oblique and extends into the carpometacarpal(CMC) joints. It is highly unstable due to the pull of abductor pollicis longus on the shaft of the
metacarpal.
X-ray shows a triangular fragment in contact with the medial edge of the trapezium and proximal subluxation of the rest of the thumb.
surgical correction with percutaneous K-wire or open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with a lag screw is the preferred treatment.


March fracture - These are stress fractures that usually involve the second metatarsal. It is
typically seen in military recruits or runners. On examination, a tender lump may be noted in the midshaft region of the metatarsal. similar lesions may be also seen in osteoporotic individuals.
The x-ray may be normal initially but later show a hairline crack. After a period of 4-6 weeks, a mass of callus can be identified.



Reduction and splintage are not necessary as it is undisplaced. Normal walking can be done and it's managed by elastic bandage of the forefoot.


Boxer's fracture - It refers to the fracture at the neck of the fifth metacarpal. It is usually produced by striking an object with the hand as seen with a boxer's punch.
It is managed using a gutter splint with flexed MCp joints and straight Ip joints until the discomfort settles.",,A,5352-3395.PNG;5352-3394.PNG;5353-3397.PNG;5353-3396.PNG
Q7,Arrange the following in the correct sequence for the Thomas test:,"a)1,2,3,4,5
b)3,2,1,4,6
c)3,2,6,5,4
d)3,6,2,5,4","Among the given options, the correct sequence for the Thomas test is given by option C i.e. 3,2,6,5,4.



Thomas test is used to detect flexion deformity of the hip. Flexion deformity is a common hip deformity, often caused by stronger flexor muscles overpowering the extensor muscles. when there is a spasm of the muscles, the stronger flexors pull the hip in flexion. soft tissue
contractures can convert this into a fixed flexion deformity, making locomotion impossible.
steps of Thomas test:
• positioning: The patient is instructed to lie supine on a hard surface with their legs fully extended.
• observing lumbar lordosis: As the patient assumes the supine position, the curvature of the lower back is visually assessed for any exaggerated lumbar lordosis. It is noted that excessive lumbar lordosis may be a compensatory response to a flexion deformity.
• Gradual flexion of the normal hip: The normal hip is gradually flexed, with care taken not to exceed its normal range of motion.
• Monitoring for overcorrection: During the flexion of the normal hip, signs of overcorrection on the normal side are observed, such as the pelvis starting to lift off the ground. To prevent this,    both ischial tuberosities are ensured to remain in contact with the surface.
• Automatic positioning of the affected hip: As a result of the flexion of the normal hip, the affected hip automatically assumes the deformed position characterized by flexion.
• Measuring the degree of flexion: once the affected hip is in the flexed position, the angle formed between the affected thigh and the bed is measured. This angle represents the actual degree of
flexion deformity.",,C,5354-3398.PNG
Q8,"Following a femoral shaft fracture, your consultant asks you to provide tibial traction. which of the following will you request from the nurse?","a)1, 2, 4
b)3, 5, 6
c)3, 4, 5
d)1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6","Among the given options, steinmann pin, Bohler's stirrup, and Bohler Braun splint are used for tibial traction in femoral shaft fractures.
steinmann pin: It is a stout, straight steel rod used to provide skeletal traction. Its diameter
ranges from 3 to 6 mm. The common sites where it is used include the upper end of the tibia, the



supracondylar region of the femur, and the calcaneum.
Bohler's stirrup: It is used to hold a steinmann pin and apply traction. The screws on the sides of the stirrup hold the pin. The direction of traction can be changed without moving the pin inside    the bone, which prevents the pin from loosening.
Bohler Braun splint: This refers to Bohler’s modification of the Braun splint. It consists of a heavy metal frame with four pulleys. It is used for the treatment of fracture shaft femur and
supracondylar fractures of the femur. It can also be used for the fractured shaft of the tibia and fibula.
other options:
Denham pin: This pin is threaded in the center and engages the bony cortex, which reduces the     risk of pin sliding. It is used when the bone is cancellous -like calcaneum and osteoporotic bones.
Kirschner wire or K-wire is 1 to 3 mm in diameter. The wire is pointed at both ends for both
anterograde and retrograde insertion. The shape of the tips could be trocar, diamond or threaded. It is used in small bone fractures.
Thomas splint: It is used for immobilizing fractures of the femur.
Given below are the images of these instruments",,B,5355-3399.PNG;5356-3402.PNG;5356-3401.PNG;5356-3400.PNG;5357-3403.PNG
Q9,The deformity shown in the image below is noted when a patient tries to extend his fingers. Injury to which nerve can lead to this condition?,"a)ulnar nerve
b)Radial nerve
c)Median nerve
d)posterior interosseous nerve","The given image shows extension at the metacarpophalangeal joint and flexion at the
interphalangeal joints of the ring and little fingers while the patient tries to extend his fingers, suggesting an ulnar nerve injury.
The ulnar nerve supplies the medial two lumbricals in the hand. The lumbricals have a combined  action on metacarpophalangeal (McP) joint flexion and interphalangeal (IP) joint extension (glass holding posture). In ulnar nerve injury, since the medial lumbricals are not functional, the
forearm muscles are unopposed. Hence, there is hyperextension at McP joints and flexion at IP joints. This causes claw hand deformity. There is also numbness of the ulnar one and a half
fingers.
Elbow fractures or dislocations lead to high lesions of the ulnar nerve. Here, the hand is not
markedly deformed because the ulnar half of the flexor digitorum profundus (which is responsible for flexing the fingers) is paralyzed and the fingers, therefore, appear less clawed. This is called
the high ulnar paradox.
The following tests are done to test the integrity of the ulnar nerve:
• Egawa's test - In a positive test, due to the weakness of the dorsal interossei, side-to-side movements of the middle finger is weak.
• Book test or Froment's sign - The patient is asked to hold a book forcefully while the doctor tries to pull it. In a positive test, due to weakness of adductor pollicis muscle, adduction of thumb is
lost. The patient tries to hold the book by using flexor pollicis longus muscle. This produces flexion at the inter-phalangeal joint while holding the book.
• card test - In the case of weak palmar interossei, it is easy for the examiner to pull out the card  when held between the fingers. This is due to the loss of adduction by palmar interossei muscles.





other options
option B - In radial nerve palsy, the patient presents with 'wrist drop' in case of paralyzed wrist   extensors, and 'finger drop' when extensor digitorum is paralyzed. when there is compression in the axilla, radial nerve palsy is called saturday night palsy. There is paralysis of the triceps, and   weakness of the wrist and hand. In high lesions, there is sensory loss on the dorsum of the hand  over the anatomical snuffbox.
option C - In median nerve injury, paralysis of opponens pollicis muscle leads to 'ape thumb'
deformity. In forearm or elbow injuries, there is paralysis of long flexors of the thumb, index, and middle fingers, radial wrist flexors, and forearm pronators. This leads to the characteristic
'pointing index finger' when the patient tries to make a fist. There is sensory loss over three and a half digits on the radial side.
option D -posterior interosseous nerve injury, is seen in posterior interosseous syndrome. The wrist is in radial deviation and there is loss of metacarpophalangeal joint extension. However,  wrist extension is preserved.",5343-3392.PNG,A,5357-3403-1.png
Q10,A 6o-year-old woman with a history of colles' fracture 8 months ago comes to the orthopedics outpatient department. Her T score is -2.5 and she attained menopause at the age of 52 years. she is currently asymptomatic. what treatment will you give this patient?,"a)Hormone replacement therapy
b)Alendronate
c)calcium and vitamin D
d)Repeat DEXA scan after 3 months","The clinical vignette of an elderly post-menopausal woman with a history of Colles' fracture and a  T score of -2.5 suggests postmenopausal osteoporosis and the treatment of choice in this condition would be a bisphosphonate such as alendronate.
options A and C: Hormone replacement therapy, calcium and vitamin D supplements, and calcitonin are not recommended treatments to reduce fracture risk in osteoporosis.
option D: Repeating the DEXA scan after 3 months will not be required as the patient's T score (- 2.5) already suggests osteoporosis. DEXA is done in the following patients to screen for
osteoporosis:
• Females aged 65 years or more
• Males aged 7o years or more



• postmenopausal females under the age of 65 years with risk factors
• Fracture after the age of 5o years
• Males aged 5o-69 with risk factors
osteoporosis is a common metabolic bone disease characterized by a diffuse reduction in bone    density due to a decrease in bone mass. It is typically asymptomatic until fractures occur. These  fractures are commonly low trauma in nature, defined as a fall from standing height or less. The initial fracture that often occurs is in the distal radius, known as colles' fracture, followed by
fractures in the vertebrae and hip unless treatment is initiated.
A DEXA scan is the investigation of choice in diagnosing osteoporosis and the results are reported in terms ofT-score. According to WHo, a T score of
• -1 or higher is considered normal
• -1.o1 to -2.49 is defined as osteopenia.
• -2.5 or lower is defined as osteoporosis
Bisphosphonates like alendronate are the drugs of choice for fracture prevention in
postmenopausal women. They specifically inhibit bone resorption and thus are very effective in  treating osteoporosis. They concentrate at sites of active remodeling by remaining in the matrix until the bone is remodeled. Then, they are released in the acidic environment of the resorption lacunae and induce apoptosis in osteoclasts.
other treatment options for postmenopausal osteoporosis are:
• Denosumab - This is an antibody to RANKL that promotes osteoclastogenesis. Inhibiting RANKL thus decreases osteoclastic activity.
• parathyroid hormone - preotact and teriparatide are anabolic hormones. They promote bone  formation when given at intermittent low doses. Aboloparatide is a new drug in this group that has been tried for this condition.
• Raloxifene - It is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (sERM) approved and shown to be effective in preventing vertebral fractures.
• strontium ranelate - It is thought to promote osteogenesis but is strongly contraindicated in patients prone to thromboembolic events.
• Romosozumab - sclerostin inhibits osteoblastic activity. Romosozumab shows anti-sclerostin activity, thereby increasing bone formation.",,B,
Q11,"Following a road traffic accident, a patient develops type IIIa compound tibial fracture. Arrange the following external fixators in decreasing order of their stability (highest to  lowest).","a)1&gt;2&gt;3&gt;4
b)2&gt;4&gt;3&gt;1
c)1&gt;4&gt;3&gt;2
d)2&gt;3&gt;1&gt;4","Among the given options, Ilizarov&gt; Biplanar frame/Ring with cylindrical rod&gt; uniplanar
with double rod&gt; uniplanar with a single rod (1&gt;4&gt;3&gt;2) represents the correct order of stability of the given external fixators.
External fixation provides rigid fixation of the bones. This is commonly used in severe open types II and III fractures, as the application of a cast, or traction methods and internal fixation is not
recommended



The principle of external fixation is the transfixion of bone above and below the fracture with
schanz screws or tensioned wires and these are then connected to each other by rigid bars. There are numerous types of external fixation devices:
• A unilateral frame with a support member and half-pins on one plane constitute a unilateral one-plane configuration. The addition of a second support member and the second plane of    half-pins form a unilateral two-plane configuration.
• Transfixation pins connected to support members at either end are used to build the bilateral  one-plane configuration. The addition of a second plane of half-pins forms a bilateral two-plane configuration.
• Ring fixators consist of complete or partial rings connected by rods. The rings are fixed to the bone via half pins or wires under high tension.
circular external fixators confer greater stability and often negate the need to span
joints. unilateral external fixation is commonly used as a temporary method of fixation. Its
disadvantages include the need to span joints for sufficient stability. uniplanar fixation devices are quick and easy to apply but are less sturdy than multiplanar fixation. Bilateral frames are    created when the pins are on both sides of the bone and can also add additional stability.
Given below is an Ilizarov ring fixator.",,C,5360-3404.PNG
Q12,"A 45-year-old patient with a tibial fracture in a cast presented to the emergency department     with complaints of intense pain. The cast was removed and on examination, passive extension was painful. The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were present and there was a loss    of sensation over the first web space. what is the next step?","a)Duplex imaging
b)Re-apply cast
c)Measure anterior compartment pressure
d)Analgesics","The clinical presentation of this patient with a history of tibial fracture complaining of intense
pain, with painful passive extension and loss of sensation of the first web space upon the removal of the cast, is suggestive of acute compartment syndrome. The next step would be to measure the anterior compartment pressure to confirm the diagnosis.
Acute compartment syndrome refers to the rise in intra-compartmental pressure leading to tissue ischemia and necrosis. The injuries at high risk of developing acute compartment syndrome are    fractures of the proximal one-third of the tibia, soft tissue injury, distal radius fracture, and



diaphyseal fracture of the forearm. other high-risk injuries are crush injuries and circumferential burns.
The classic features of ischemia in acute compartment syndrome include the 5 ps:
• pain: is the first symptom of acute compartment syndrome. on passive stretching of the muscles, severe pain can be elicited.
• paresthesia: paresthesia and hypoesthesia are the first signs of nerve ischemia.
• paralysis: paralysis of muscle groups affected in that compartment is a late sign.
• pulselessness: usually, the peripheral pulses and capillary return are intact in the early stages, unless there is a major arterial injury. If pulses are absent, arteriography is indicated.
• pallor: may not always be seen as ischemia occurs at the capillary level.
The diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring the intra-compartmental pressure using a split catheter introduced into the compartment. The difference between diastolic pressure and
compartment pressure is known as differential pressure (Δp). If the differential pressure (Δp) is less than 3o mm Hg, immediate compartment decompression is indicated.
Treatment:
• prompt decompression of the affected compartment is done.
• All the dressings, bandages, and cast on the affected limb are removed and the limb is nursed flat.
• Fasciotomy is done if the differential pressure is less than 3o mm Hg

c)1-a, 2-d, 3-b, 4-c
d)1-d, 2-a, 3-b, 4-c","option C is the correct answer. The given lesions and the correctly matched best modes of management are as follows:
osteosarcoma: is the most common primary malignant tumor of the bone. It is a high-grade
medullary osteoid-producing tumor. The preferred method of treatment of osteosarcoma is wide resection and reconstruction. This is mainly owing to the possibility of limb salvage. Amputation is considered only when tumor-safe surgical margins are compromised.
Multi-agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with agents like doxorubicin, cisplatin, ifosfamide, and  methotrexate is started immediately after diagnosis for 8-12 weeks. The tumor is then re-staged followed by wide resection and limb reconstruction.
Radiographic findings include - a periosteal reaction is the typical finding and it may take the
form of a Codman's triangle or it may have a sunburst (sunray) appearance on X-ray. It is shown in the image below:

simple bone cysts: these are cystic bone cavities that are often solitary and unilocular filled with     serous or serosanguinous material. The lesions usually regress with bone maturity. In cases where the lesions are active, an injection of steroids is done. only when there is a high risk of fracture,
curettage or fixation and stabilization may be required.
It is seen as a well-outlined lytic centrally placed lesion with cortical thinning on X-ray. when
there is a fracture, a small fragment may be visualized within the cavity, known as the fallen leaf sign. The image below shows a bone cyst in the humerus along with a pathological fracture and   the fallen leaf sign:





Giant cell tumor: it is a benign, locally aggressive tumor of the bone due to the proliferation of mononuclear cells with scattered macrophages.
In stages 1 and 2, intralesional curettage with debridement of the lesional wall is effective. stage 3 of the disease can be treated through curettage but some cases require en-bloc resection.
Antibodies like denosumab (anti-RANKL) have been effective in controlling osteoclastic activity.
Radiographically, they are observed as an eccentrically located solitary lytic lesion in
the metaphyses. They show a characteristic soap bubble appearance and periosteal new bone formation is absent.
Below image shows the soap bubble appearance seen in a giant cell tumor:


osteoid osteoma: it is a benign tumor formed of osteoid and woven bone surrounded by a halo of reactive bone. The preferred method of treatment in this condition is CT-guided radiofrequency    ablation to eradicate the lesion and improve symptoms.

Q14,"In nerve injuries, if the outer sheath and nerve fiber are intact while the inner axons are damaged, what is it known as?","a)Neurapraxia
b)Axonapraxia
c)Axonotmesis
d)Neurotmesis","In nerve injuries, an intact outer sheath and nerve fiber with damaged inner axons is referred to as axonotmesis.
According to seddon's classification, peripheral nerve injuries can be classified as follows:
• Neurapraxia: This refers to the temporary failure of nerve function without physical axon
disruption. There is no degeneration, and normal axonal function typically returns within hours to months, often within the 2-4 week range.
• Axonotmesis: This involves the disruption of axons and myelin while the surrounding connective tissue (including endoneurium and perineurium) remains intact. Axonal degeneration occurs both proximally and distally from the site of injury. Distal degeneration is known as wallerian
degeneration. Recovery may occur after 18 months.
• Neurotmesis: This refers to the disruption of axons and endoneurial tubes, with the degeneration of both proximal and distal axons.
Axonapraxia is a disruption to the axoplasmic flow of neurochemicals temporarily.",,C,
