Q2,India is a country with different cultures and diverse languages. which of the following steps should a physician take to address the patient for better outcomes?,"a)1, 2
b)2, 3
c)3, 4
d)1, 4","The physician should have good communication and consider the patient's religious, and cultural perceptions for better outcomes (statements 1 and 4 are correct).
statement 1 is true since the proper usage of vocabulary that is easy for the patient to
understand is essential for the patient. The doctor should clarify the patient's interpretation of the words used. Thus insisting on good communication is essential for better health outcomes.
statement 2 is not true. An interpreter is needed if the patient is not a native speaker of the
language spoken in that region. The interpreter can be a family member above the age of 16 or an independent interpreter. communication gets affected with open-ended questioning getting lost    in the double translation. The answer returned might not be adequate for the doctor and the
consultation as such becomes longer than usual. The doctor will have to change to a more direct style of questioning to prevent any misunderstanding.
statement 3 is not true while statement 4 is true. Personality, culture, and beliefs are important in creating trust between the doctor and patient and are an important component in the medical
interview for a better outcome. The doctor must listen to the patients' concerns, and preferences.
Health communication may fail if the message is not adequate. A good message should have the following:
• It should be in line with the objective
• It needs to be meaningful
• Based on the felt needs
• clear and understandable
• specific and accurate
• culturally and socially appropriate.",,D,
Q3,"5-year-old Ram and 3-year-old sham are Rama Devi's sons. sham developed a rash, but
Rama Devi ignored it, assuming it to be an allergy. After 3 days, Ram also developed a rash    along with a fever. out of fear, Rama Devi took Ram to the primary health center (PHC). The healthcare workers at the PHC suspected it to be measles. Choose all correct options from
among the following:","a)1 and 4 are correct
b)1 only is correct
c)1, 2, 3 and 4 are correct
d)1 and 3 are correct","All 4 statements are correct from the given clinical scenario.
statement 1 is correct: Ram is the index case as he was the first case to come to the attention of the investigating authority (PHc)



statement 2 is correct: From the given clinical scenario, considering the family of Ramadevi as a unit, sham is the primary case (the first person who gets the communicable disease and
introduces it to the community).
statement 3 is correct:
• Incubation period from the time of exposure to the development of rash is 7 to 18 days with an average of 14 days.
• Ram developed the rash 3 days after sham. considering the period of communicability of rash as 4 days prior to or 4 days later than the onset of rash, it is evident that sham was in an infectious    state and Ram has contracted the infection from sham
statement 4 is correct: Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) can be given in the form of a vaccine or  immunoglobulin. The vaccine can be given within 72 hours of exposure, while immunoglobulin    (IVIG) can be given up to 6 days following exposure. Hence, Ram could would have been eligible to receive PEP if he were brought to the PHc along with sham.",,C,
Q4,"You are measuring a patient's blood pressure at a primary health center when the
sphygmomanometer fell and broke and mercury was spilled onto the ground. How will you clean the mercury?","a)collect it by using a card onto a sheet of paper and put the mercury into a jar
b)collect it by sweeping it with a broom and throw it outside
c)collect it by sweeping it and flush it in the toilet
d)collect it by hand and then wash hands with water","Mercury is cleaned by collecting it by using a card onto a sheet of paper and putting the mercury into a jar.
After a mercury spill, the following steps should be followed:
• Isolation of the spill and ventilation of the area
• collection of items to clean the spill: zipper-top plastic bags, trash bags, gloves, paper towels, cardboard or squeegee, eye dropper, tape, flashlight, and powdered sulfur.
• clean up the spill.
• After putting on the gloves, the glass pieces are picked and placed on a towel, rolled and disposed of into a zipper-top plastic bag, and finally sealed.
• The beads of mercury are cleaned by using cardboard or a squeegee. They are rolled onto a sheet of paper, disposed into the zipper bag, and sealed.
• Powdered sulfur may be used to absorb small beads that are not visible
• Looking for any missed spill using a flashlight
• Remove other mercury contaminated items and wipe off any mercury beads with a wet towel into a plastic trash bag
• Proper disposal of contaminated clean-up materials.
• keep the area well ventilated for 24 hours, keep pets and children away from the area
The use of a vacuum cleaner or broom to clean the spill should be avoided. This will break the
mercury into smaller droplets and spread it further. Mercury should not be poured down any
drain. Do not use a washing machine to clean the clothes contaminated with mercury. This can    contaminate the water and sewage. Mercury-contaminated shoes or clothing should not be worn.",,A,
Q5,The true statement about screening tests for genetic diseases is:,"a)It is always invasive
b)screening test has better accuracy than diagnostic test
c)It defines risk of transmission of disease to the child
d)screening requires genetic mapping","The true statement about screening tests for genetic diseases is it defines the risk of transmission of disease to the child.
A screening test is an initial examination done in apparently healthy individuals while diagnostic tests are done on individuals with positive test results for further workup and treatment.
The aim of performing a screening test is to favorably change the natural history of the disease by an early diagnosis and treatment in individuals who are positive for the particular screening test.  They are less invasive and less accurate than diagnostic tests.
Genetic screening is a type of public health program done in high-risk asymptomatic individuals in which tests are used to detect an inherited predisposition to disease, risk of transmitting the   disease, prevention of the disease, early treatment, or family planning. For example, prenatal
screening during pregnancy.
Genetic mapping is a tool used to identify new genes and their functions. It also may give
information on which chromosome contains the defective gene and where the gene is present on that chromosome. Gene maps have been used to pinpoint the gene responsible for rare
single-gene inherited disorders. screening does not require genetic mapping.",,C,
Q6,which of the following is the true statement regarding measures to prevent typhoid transmission in the community?,"a)Typhoid vaccine administration is the best method of preventing transmission
b)Hygiene practices and clean sanitation control is more important than typhoid vaccine
c)In 1o% cases, person to person transmission occurs
d)Drug resistance in typhoid is not as big a problem as in TB","The true statement regarding typhoid transmission preventive measures is that hygiene practices   and clean sanitation control are more important than the typhoid vaccine. It helps in breaking the chain of transmission.
Typhoid fever is caused by salmonella typhi and is mainly transmitted to humans by the fecal-oral route.
clinical features include high fever with chills associated with headache, malaise, cough, sore
throat, abdominal pain, and constipation or diarrhea are seen in the early phase. The fever occurs  in a step-ladder fashion reaching a plateau in 7-1o days. A maculopapular rash may be seen on the trunk and chest known as rose spots. In the late stages, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal
distension, relative bradycardia, and a dicrotic pulse can occur.
Diagnosis is by isolation of the organism from blood, bone marrow, and stools. Blood culture is mainly used for the diagnosis. other tests such as the widal tests are useful.
Management is mainly by sanitation. It is the ultimate method to control typhoid. It breaks the transmission of the disease. It is combined with proper health education.
Antibiotic therapy is started early and the choice of antibiotics depends on the susceptibility of the organism to the drug. In the case of drug-susceptible typhoid, ciprofloxacin is useful.
Drug resistance to typhoid has been emerging. similar to drug resistance in TB, there are
multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) s. Typhi strains. MDR strains      are resistant against at least 1 out of 3 or &gt;3 categorically differentiated antimicrobials, such as ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol. XDR are those which are resistant to all except    1-2 antimicrobials.
ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and (oral) cefixime are effective for the treatment of MDR enteric fever.



Immunization is a complementary approach in management since the protective efficacy can be overcome by a high inoculum in the case of food-borne diseases.
The typhoid vaccines available are the Vi polysaccharide vaccine and the Ty21a vaccine. Ty21a is a live attenuated vaccine recommended after 6 years and is given orally on days 1,3,5 and 7. Vi
polysaccharide vaccine can be given after 2 years as a single dose with a booster dose for every 2 years.",,B,
Q7,which of the following is true about the management of a baby born to an HIV-positive mother?,"a)If replacement feeding, the neonate should be tested for HIV, if negative, ART is not required.
b)In exclusive breastfeeding, give nevirapine for 6 months only when baby is positive
c)If replacement feeding, the neonate need not receive nevirapine if HIV negative
d)If exclusive replacement feeding, give nevirapine for 6 weeks, even if the baby is negative","If exclusive replacement feeding, giving nevirapine for 6 weeks, even if the baby is negative is true regarding the management of a baby born to an HIV-positive mother.
The national AIDS control organization (NACO) has recommended the following for an infant born to an HIV-positive mother.
According to the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), antiretroviral therapy (ART)
should be given to all HIV-positive pregnant women including during labor hours and
breastfeeding. They are started on a triple-drug ART. ART should be given irrespective of the CD4 count, and clinical stage and should be continued lifelong.
Immediate care of HIV-exposed infants includes wiping of baby's mouth and nostrils, handling of infants with gloves, immediate cord clamping, and initiation of feeding. An infant born to an
HIV-positive mother should be breastfed exclusively or by replacement feeds exclusively for 6 months of age.
Infants should receive ARV prophylaxis. A single drug or dual drug regimen is followed depending on the risk of transmission which can be low or high risk.
• Low-risk infants are those born to mothers with a low viral load which is detected after 32 weeks of pregnancy till delivery.
• High-risk infants are those born to HIV-positive mothers, not on ART, with viral load not     estimated beyond 32 weeks, viral load not suppressed after 32 weeks, or diagnosed with HIV within 6 weeks of delivery.

Q8,what is the branch of statistics dealing with describing the internal collection of data?,"a)Theoretical statistics
b)Descriptive statistics
c)Analytical statistics
d)Inferential statistics","Descriptive statistics is the branch that deals with describing the internal collection of data.



statistical methods are mainly of two types
• Descriptive statistics is a type of statistical method which helps to describe, organise or
summarise the data. It refers only to the actual data. They are described by the measures of central tendency and the degrees of dispersion.
• Inferential statistics involves going beyond the actual data and making inferences to test the hypothesis.
other types of statistics:
• Analytical statistics is mainly used to test the hypothesis.
• Theoretical statistics is a mathematical approach which involves describing, predicting the events or analyzing the relationship between things.",,B,
Q9,Isolation in a separate room is mandatory for which of the following air-borne infections?,"a)Measles
b)Rabies
c)Nipah
d)Aseptic meningitis","Isolation in a separate room is mandatory for measles among the given options. It is transmitted by droplet infection as well as via the airborne route. The period of isolation is from the onset of symptoms (catarrhal stage) through the fourth day of the rash.
Isolation is defined as the separation of an infected person or animal for the period of
communicability in places to prevent direct or indirect transmission to susceptible individuals.
Measles is an infectious disease mainly seen in the childhood age group. It is caused by an RNA paramyxovirus and is transmitted to humans primarily by droplet infection and also
through airborne transmission.
Features include
• The prodromal phase-characterized by fever, cough, coryza, and koplik's spots which are rashes seen in the buccal mucosa opposite the first and second molar.
• The eruptive phase- macular or maculopapular rash begins behind the ears and spreads to the face, neck, and extremities.
• Post measles phase is characterized by weight loss.
some of the complications of measles include otitis media, laryngotracheobronchitis (croup), diarrhea, post-infectious measles, or subacute sclerosing pan encephalitis (ssPE). subacute    sclerosing panencephalitis is a rare but fatal complication.
Treatment is mainly aimed at supportive care such as relieving the symptoms, treating
dehydration, and isolating patients.
The below images show a characteristic rash in measles and koplik's spots on the buccal mucosa.






other options:
option B: Rabies is transmitted via a bite or scratch from an infected animal. Contraction of
rabies by inhalation of virus-containing aerosols is extremely rare. Human-to-human transmission is possible but has not been confirmed.
option C: Nipah is transmitted mainly from direct contact with sick pigs or their contaminated
tissues. To prevent human-to-human transmission, close unprotected contact with infected people is avoided. Regular hand hygiene should be followed when caring for or visiting infected people.
option D: If the diagnosis is confirmed as aseptic meningitis, the patient can often be discharged home. Isolation is required if the meningitis is of infectious etiology.",,A,2550-1598.PNG;2550-1599.PNG
Q10,All the following cause widening of confidence interval except?,"a)Increase in sample size
b)Decrease in sample size
c)Increase in variability
d)Increase in confidence level","All the given options cause a widening of confidence interval except for an increase in sample size. An increase in sample size leads to a narrower confidence interval.
Research is usually done with samples drawn from a population, rather than by using the entire population. In order to get a fair idea of the population parameters, sample statistics and
estimates of error in the sample are used to get a range of values. This range is the confidence interval (CI). It is estimated based on a desirable confidence level.
The confidence interval is calculated as the difference between upper and lower confidence limits.
The width of the CI is an indication of the utility of our population parameter estimation. Factors affecting the width of the confidence interval include:
• Desired confidence level- width of CI is directly proportionate to the confidence level
• Variability in the sample- width of CI is directly proportionate to the variability in the data
• sample size- width of the CI is inversely related to the sample size
Therefore, increases in variability and confidence levels and decreases in sample size lead to wider confidence intervals.",,A,
Q11,False statement regarding rabies immunoglobin is:,"a)It is exclusively given in the deltoid
b)The dose is 2o IU/kg
c)Not given after 7 days of the 1st dose of the vaccine
d)If human RIG is unavailable, equine is preferred","The false statement regarding rabies immunoglobulin is it is exclusively given in the deltoid.
Rabies immunoglobulin is given as much as possible into the wound site or around it.
Rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) is passive immunization. It is administered only once, preferably within 24 hours of the exposure, ie, on day o of the anti-rabies vaccine (ARV). If RIG was not
given with the ARV 1st dose, it can be given up to the 7th day after the first dose ofARV. It is not given after 7 days of receiving the 1st dose ofARV.
The dose is 2o IU/kg body weight for human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) and for equine rabies immunoglobulin (ERIG), the dose is 4o IU/kg body weight. when HRIG is not available, ERIG
can be used. They are potent, safe, and less expensive.
The entire RIG dose or as much as anatomically possible should be infiltrated into the wound or as close as possible. If it is likely that there are additional small wounds, the remaining RIG
should be given IM as close as possible to the site of wound or exposure.
All patients with category III exposures should be given RIG. This includes:
• single/multiple transdermal bites/scratches
• licks on broken skin
• contamination of mucous membranes with saliva
• contact with bats
In immunocompromised patients, RIG should be given to both category II and III exposures.",,A,
Q12,"A 1-year-old child is brought to the healthcare unit that you are working on. His mother
mentions that he had received the first dose of DPT vaccine at 6 weeks of age but has missed vaccination since then. what would you advise the patient?","a)Do not give DPT
b)Restart DPT
c)Give second dose of DPT
d)Give dT alone","The advice for the patient is to give the second dose of DPT (Diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus).
DPT is a combined vaccine given for immunization against the three diseases diphtheria,
pertussis, and tetanus. It is given to infants as early as 6 weeks following birth. The pertussis
component of the vaccine is not recommended beyond 6 years due to the decrease in the severity of pertussis infection with age. 7 years of age onwards, only Td combinations are used.
It is given in 3 doses with an interval of 4 weeks followed by booster doses at 18-24 months and at 5 years of age. The dosage is o.5 mL and is given in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh
intramuscularly. The immunization can be resumed without repeating the previous dose in case of any delayed or interrupted immunization.
Adverse effects include fever, and neurological complications such as encephalitis, convulsions, infantile spasms and Reye's syndrome.
Anaphylaxis is a contraindication for subsequent vaccination with diphtheria, pertussis, or tetanus vaccine. Encephalopathy following vaccination is a contraindication for pertussis vaccine. DT is
given for successive doses.
Events such as inconsolable cry, fever more than 4o.5°c, seizures with or without fever are considered as precautions, and not contraindications for DTwP.
Note: IAP guidelines state that ""temperature more than &gt;4o.5°c is a precaution and not
contraindication"". Park's 27th Ed states that ""temperature above 4o°c is a contraindication to DPT"". This topic is controversial, however, IAP guidelines are commonly followed by
practitioners.",,C,
Q13,The following image shows a health belief model. what does box C stand for?,"a)Perceived control
b)Behavioral modification
c)Health motivation
d)self-efficacy","Box c stands for health motivation.
The health belief model was proposed from the idea that a person's health behavior changes in accordance with certain beliefs.



It can be categorized as follows:
• Individual perceptions.
• variable factors that modify beliefs.
• Action.
Individual perceptions:
perceived susceptibility refers to a person's own beliefs about the probability of developing a disease. If the perceived susceptibility is high, an individual is more likely to engage in
health-promoting behavior to reduce the chances of contracting the illness.
perceived severity is an individual's assessment of the severity of a particular health problem. If     the disease is perceived to have a high severity, then the person is more likely to adopt a healthier lifestyle.
perceived threat comprises perceived susceptibility and severity. people with a higher perceived threat tend to take on health-promoting activities.
Action:
perceived benefits refer to a person's subjective judgment on how a particular health habit is modifying his chances of developing a disease. If the person believes that a habit is likely to
reduce his/her chances of susceptibility to a disease or lower the severity of a disease, he/she is more likely to follow that healthy habit.
perceived barriers to action also influence if a person wants to follow healthy behavior. The
benefits of a particular health habit must overweigh the barriers that a person must overcome to continue following that behavior.
cues to action may be internal or external. Internal cues include pain and clinical symptoms.
External cues include awareness through media, physicians, and friends.
Behavioral modification (option B) is part of the action after assessing all of the above-mentioned concepts.
self-efficacy (option D) can be defined as a person's capacity in achieving his health goals. A     person's confidence in his/her ability to overcome limitations to attain his/her health goals was found to be a major factor in determining the outcome of his behavioral changes.
The health belief system is thought to be useful in analyzing health behavior patterns and
formulating disease prevention plans based on these beliefs. All internal and external factors,    including demographic and psychological characteristics, aim at health motivation to attain the action phase of a health belief system.
other options:
option A: perceived control refers to a person's internal belief in the control they would have over things that are part of the past or the future or over a process, behavior, and outcome. perceived    control can influence all of the categories of the health belief system.",2536-1592.PNG,C,2552-1600.PNG
Q14,A point-of-care diagnostic test with a sensitivity of 98% shows a negative test result in a patient. what does this imply?,"a)The patient would need another point-of-care diagnostic test for the same clinical condition.
b)Prevalance of the disease is 2%.
c)patient is less likely to have the disease.
d)patient has been wrongly ruled out due to false negativity.","A negative result in a diagnostic test with a sensitivity of 98% implies that the patient is less likely to have the disease.
sensitivity is the proportion of all people with the disease who test positive. It is the probability of the test being positive when the disease is present. The sensitivity of a test is given by those
who have the disease and test positive (true positives) out of the total diseased population.
other statements:
option A: The patient would not need another point-of-care diagnostic test for the same clinical condition as the sensitivity of the diagnostic test is 98%.
option B: prevalence refers to the number of old and new cases at a given point in time or over a period of time in a given population. It cannot be derived from the given data.
option D: The higher the sensitivity of a diagnostic test, the lower will be the number of false
negatives. since the test has a 98% sensitivity, the patient most likely does not have the disease.",,C,
Q15,"The table given below shows a multivariate analysis of the relation between the risk of
developing blindness and age, literacy rate, residence, and gender. which of the following is true?","a)2 and 3
b)1 and 3
c)1 and 2
d)3 and 4","The correct statements drawn from the values given in the table are 3 and 4.
An odds ratio is a measure of the association between an exposure and an outcome. It represents the odds that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure in comparison to the odds ofthe outcome occurring in the absence of that exposure.
An odds ratio of 1 indicates that the risk factor is not related to the disease.
An odds ratio of less than 1 indicates that a person with the disease is less likely to have been exposed to the factor, implying that the factor may be a protective factor against the disease.
An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates that the odds ratio is significant, and the factor can be ascertained as a risk factor.
The p-value is the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the one that was actually  observed in the biological or clinical experiment. A p-value of less than o.o5 indicates that the test result is statistically significant.
other options:
statement 1: Female population is at greater risk of developing blindness is a false statement;
since the odds ratio is &lt;1, the female population will be at lesser risk of developing blindness than the male population.
statement 2: people dwelling in rural areas are at increased risk of developing blindness is also false; a p-value of &gt;o.o5 means that this association is not statistically significant.",,D,
Q16,A patient with lymphatic filarisis is being managed as shown in the image below. what is the level of prevention done here?,"a)specific protection
b)Disability limitation
c)primary prevention
d)Health promotion","The image shows an established case of chronic lymphatic filariasis, where hygiene is being
maintained to prevent further disability by secondary bacterial infection. Disability limitation is a mode of intervention in tertiary prevention.



other options:
option A: specific protection is a mode of intervention in primary prevention which aims at
limiting the number of cases of a particular disease. This includes immunization, use of specific nutrients, chemoprophylaxis, accident protection, and avoidance of allergens.
option C: primary prevention is a level of prevention which is defined as action taken prior to the onset of a disease, which removes the possibility that a disease will ever occur. It is accomplished  by measures designed to promote general health and well-being.
option D: Health promotion is a mode of intervention in primary prevention, and is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and improve health. Health promotion may be achieved   through health education, environmental modification, nutritional interventions or lifestyle
changes.",2537-1593.PNG,B,
Q17,which of the following indicators can help in determining whether the health system is giving importance to identifying leprosy in the community?,"a)Treatment completion rate
b)Annual new case detection rate per lac
c)Treatment initiation rate
d)proportion of newly diagnosed patients with grade-2 disability","The proportion of newly diagnosed patients with grade 2 disability is useful in determining whether the health system is giving importance to identifying leprosy in the community.
The National Leprosy Eradication programme (NLEp) was introduced in 1983. The strategy of     NLEp is to control the disease through a reduction in the infection and the infective source, thus breaking the chain of disease transmission. It functions under National Health Mission (NHM).
The vision of the NLEp is 'Leprosy-free India'. Disability prevention and medical rehabilitation
(DpMR) is the priority of the programme. The mission of  NLEp is to provide quality services free of cost to all people through the integrated healthcare system.
Main indicators for evaluating case detection:
• proportion of grade-2 disabilities among new cases
• proportion of females among new cases
• proportion of MB among new cases
• proportion of child (o-14 years) among new cases
• Child rate per 1,oo,ooo population
• scheduled caste new case detection rate
• scheduled tribe new case detection rate",,D,
Q18,which of the following is true regarding the vaccine vial monitor (VVM)?,"a)3,4
b)1,2
c)1, 2, 3, 4, 5
d)5,6","The correct statements are 1 and 2.
Vaccine vial monitors (VVM) are heat-sensitive indicators routinely used to monitor heat exposure of the vaccine and determine vaccine viability as the vaccine vial moves across the supply chain.
It records cumulative heat exposure through a gradual change in color.



If the color of the inner square is the same or is darker than the outer circle, it indicates that the vaccine has been exposed to high temperatures and should be discarded.
A VVM can be used to assess vaccine potency and not vaccine efficacy. Vaccine potency is the
ability of the vaccine to provide adequate immunity to the patient. Vaccine potency is irreversibly lost when the vaccine is exposed to unfavorable temperatures; hence, VVM indicating heat
exposure can be used to assess whether the vaccine potency is likely to be intact or not. Vaccine
efficacy, on the other hand, is a measure of the immunity conferred by the vaccine or the ability of the vaccine to prevent the disease in a vaccinated person under ideal conditions, such as clinical
trials. The term vaccine efficacy is used in relation to findings of clinical trials, whereas the term vaccine potency is used for regular usage of the vaccine. Vaccine efficacy is determined only
during clinical trials, whereas vaccine potency is tested for every batch of the vaccine that is manufactured.
There are currently 4 types of VVMs; they are chosen to match the heat sensitivity of the vaccines based on the VVM number:
• VVM 3o: High stability
• VVM 14: Medium stability
• VVM 7: Moderate stability
• VVM 2: Least stable
purpose of VVMs:
• Ensures that vaccines damaged by heat are not administered.
• Decision on which vaccines to be kept after a cold chain break occurs, minimizing unnecessary vaccine wastage.
• Decision on which vaccine is to be used first. Vaccines showing significant heat exposure should be used before those that show lower heat exposure, even if their expiry date is longer.
The expiry date of a vaccine cannot be relaxed even ifVVM is in an acceptable range. Expired
vaccines must be discarded. The expiry date of a vaccine cannot be determined using a VVM as it does not monitor the vaccine components. It only ensures that the vaccines have been exposed to the required temperatures and are viable for use.
There are two different locations for VVMs:
• on the label of the vaccine: The vaccine vial, once opened, can be kept for subsequent immunization sessions for up to 28 days, regardless of the formulation of the product.
• In a location other than on the label (e.g., cap or neck of ampoule): The vaccine vial, once opened should be discarded at the end of the immunization session or within six hours of opening,
whichever comes first, regardless of the formulation of the product.",,B,
Q19,which of the following models of disease causation is depicted in the image below?,"a)sufficient component cause model
b)Epidemiological triad
c)PERT model
d)web of causation model","The model of disease causation depicted below is a sufficient component cause model.
It was developed by Rothman based on the idea that an outcome can only happen when a
sufficient cause is present. A disease can have multiple sufficient causes. But, each sufficient cause



can consist of a pie chart of component causes, a causal pie.  one component cause can be a part    of more than one sufficient cause. A component cause can be considered necessary if it is a part of a disease's sufficient causes.
In the given model, each pie chart represents a sufficient cause made of component causes. since B is present in all the charts, it can be considered a necessary cause. All the others are
contributing causes.
other options:
option B: An epidemiological triad depicts the interrelationship between the causative agent, the host, and the environment. All of them contribute to disease development. The aim of an
epidemiological triad is to identify how to break this relationship and prevent the outbreak of the disease.
option C: PERT is used for network analysis. It is a type of quantitative management technique that helps in detailed planning and comprehensive supervision.
option D: The web of causation considers all the predisposing factors and their complex
interrelationship with each other. This model is ideally suited to study chronic disease. The web of causation does not imply that the disease is controlled only when all the multiple chains of
causation are removed. sometimes removal of one significant link is sufficient
to control the disease.",2538-1594.PNG,A,
Q20,Attributable risk calculated to understand the relation between smoking and lung cancer is 9o%. which of the following is true?,"a)1o% cases of lung cancer can be eliminated in smokers if smoking is eliminated
b)9o% cases of lung cancer can be eliminated in population if smoking is eliminated
c)9o% cases of lung cancer can be eliminated in smokers if smoking is eliminated
d)1o% cases of lung cancer can be eliminated in population if smoking is eliminated","Attributable risk (AR) describes the extent of outcome (lung cancer) that can be attributed to     exposure (smoking). In the given scenario, an AR of 9o% means that 9o% of lung cancer cases among smokers are attributable to smoking. Therefore, 9o% cases of lung cancer can be
eliminated in smokers if smoking is eliminated.
AR is the difference in incidence rates of disease between an exposed group and an unexposed
group. AR is indicative of the extent of the disease attributed to the exposure. It also refers to the  amount of disease that could be eliminated in the exposed persons if the exposure is controlled or eliminated. It also helps to determine the impact a successful preventive or public health program might have in case the exposure to cause is reduced or eliminated.
Population-attributable risk (PAR) is the difference in the incidence of disease in the total
population and the incidence of disease among those not exposed to the supposed cause. PAR is     useful in providing an estimate of the amount by which the disease could be reduced in that whole population if the suspected factor was eliminated or modified.
For example, a PAR of 9o% in the context of smoking and lung cancer means that 9o% cases of lung cancer in the population can be attributed to smoking.
Relative risk is defined as the ratio of incidence of the disease (outcome) among exposed and unexposed groups. It helps in establishing the association between a cause and a disease.
However, it does not help in assessing the extent of the cause bringing about the disease (outcome).",,C,
Q21,"Following an earthquake, the building codes were changed to earthquake-resistant buildings. which of the following step of disaster management does this fall under?","a)Disaster response
b)Disaster reconstruction
c)Disaster rehabilitation
d)Disaster mitigation","The measures that are taken to prevent disasters from causing emergencies or to lessen the likely effects of emergencies are part of disaster mitigation.
Disaster mitigation measures aim to reduce the vulnerability of the system. It complements
disaster preparedness and response activities and includes measures taken to lessen the likely effects of emergencies. some of these measures are:
• Flood mitigation
• Land-use planning
• Improved building codes
• Reduction and protection of vulnerable populations or structures.
other options:
option A - Disaster response includes activities such as rescue and first aid, field care, triage and tagging that form a part of the emergency care needed in the first few hours after a disaster.
option B - Disaster reconstruction is a part of the recovery phase after a disaster.
option C - Disaster rehabilitation refers to measures that lead to the restoration of pre-disaster conditions. These measures include water supply restoration, food safety, basic
sanitation, personal hygiene, and vector control.

Q23,which of the following criteria should be satisfied to start MDT?,"a)1,4
b)1,3
c)1,3,4
d)1,2,3,4","To start multidrug therapy (MDT), the criteria that should be satisfied are a hypopigmented patch with sensory loss and peripheral nerve thickening with sensory loss.
Leprosy (Hansen's disease) is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It mainly affects the skin and peripheral nerves. The disease has two polar forms, lepromatous   leprosy, and tuberculoid leprosy, lying at the two ends of a long spectrum of the disease.
Leprosy is diagnosed by the detection of at least one of the following cardinal signs:
• Definite loss of sensation in a pale hypopigmented patch
• Thickened or enlarged peripheral nerve, with loss of sensation and/or weakness of the muscles supplied by that nerve (statement 2)
• presence of acid-fast bacilli in a slit-skin smear.
However, a skin smear is not a prerequisite for implementing MDT. since MDT has been
introduced, many procedures have been simplified, so that leprosy patients can be detected by health workers in the field and MDT can be immediately started.",,B,

Natural history of disease refers to the progression of a disease in an individual over time, in the absence of treatment. It has two phases, a period of pre-pathogenesis and a period of
pathogenesis.





The period of pre-pathogenesis is before the onset of disease in humans. An interaction between  the agent, host and the environment occurs in this phase before the pathogenesis. It starts with    appropriate exposure to or accumulation of factors sufficient for the disease process to begin in a susceptible host. The exposure is a microorganism in an infectious disease. For lung cancer, it is  any factor that initiates the process, such as asbestos fibres or components in tobacco
smoke. primary prevention (health promotion and specific protection) is applicable in this period. The period of pathogenesis starts after the disease process has been triggered and pathological
changes occur without the individual being aware of it. It begins with the entry of
the organism till recovery, death, or disability. The subclinical or asymptomatic
period between exposure and onset of symptoms is called the incubation period for infectious diseases, and the latency period for chronic diseases. The onset of clinical symptoms is the
beginning of the clinical stage of the disease. secondary (halting of the disease process) and tertiary prevention (measures to limit disability) are applicable in this period.
Rehabilitation has been defined as the use of medical, social, educational, and vocational
measures for training the individual to the highest possible level of functional ability. It is a part of tertiary prevention like providing callipers for walking patients and arranging schooling after  being affected by polio.",,B,

Q27,Identify the formula given below:,"a)standard deviation
b)standard error
c)Median
d)variance","The formula given above is used to calculate the standard deviation.
standard deviation (or σ) is a measure of how dispersed the data is in relation to the mean. Data clustered around the mean have a low standard deviation, while data that are more spread out
have a high standard deviation. A standard deviation close to zero indicates that data points are    close to the mean, whereas a high or low standard deviation indicates data points are respectively above or below the mean.
standard error 〓 sD/√n, where sD is the standard deviation and n is the sample size
standard error will reduce when the sample size is increased.
The median divides the frequency distribution in half when all the scores are listed in order.
when a distribution has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle value. when the     distribution has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle scores.
variance is the mean of the squares of all the deviation scores of the distribution.",2541-1595.PNG,A,

d)1, 2, 3, 6","A child presenting with abrasion with slight oozing after a dog bite comes under category III. The correct statements are 1, 2, 3, and 6.
The following measures should be taken immediately to stop the contraction of rabies:
• cleansing: The most important step in the prevention of rabies is washing the affected area with plenty of soap and water under a running tap for 15 minutes. This is a standard procedure that
minimizes the contraction of rabies.
• chemical treatment: After washing and drying the wound, disinfectants like povidone-iodine and spirit can be applied.
• suturing: Bite wounds are not sutured generally. If suturing is unavoidable, rabies
immunoglobulin should be infiltrated in the depth and around the wound, and suturing should be delayed by a few hours.
• In unavoidable situations, minimal loose sutures may be applied to arrest bleeding.
• other measures: Local antibiotics and tetanus toxoids should be given.
Different wound categories for post-exposure prophylaxis:
post-exposure prophylaxis regimen for rabies:
Intramuscular regimen: In this regimen, 1 ml or o.5 ml of vaccine is injected into the deltoid in patients with category II and III wounds.
• Essen regimen: A 5-dose regimen in which 1 dose of vaccine is given on days o, 3, 7, 14, and 28.
• zagreb regimen: A 4-dose multisite regimen in which 2 doses of vaccine are given on day o, followed by 1 dose on days 7 and 21.
Intradermal regimen: In this regimen, o.1 ml of injection is given at 2 sites on days o, 3, 7, and 28. Equine Rabies Immunoglobulin at a dose of 4o IU/kg (a maximum of 3ooo IU) body weight is
given once. It is given to all category III bites and also category II bites in the case of
