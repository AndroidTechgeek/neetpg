Q1,A 3 months old baby was brought with photophobia and lacrimation. which of the following cannot be the cause?,"a)congenital entropion
b)congenital glaucoma
c)congenital distichiasis
d)congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction","congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDo) is least likely to cause watering and
photophobia.
Nasolacrimal duct obstruction is the most common disease of the lacrimal system. It usually presents in the first few weeks or months of life as excessive tearing and ocular discharge. It  mostly occurs due to incomplete canalization of the duct.
congenital NLDo mainly results in persistent tearing and sometimes a discharge from the eyes but not photophobia, as the light sensitivity is not directly related to this condition.
Typically, diagnosis is established through a combination of patient history and physical
examination. In cases where symptoms are intermittent, the presence of an obstruction can be confirmed using the fluorescein dye disappearance test.
The initial treatment involves performing nasolacrimal massage, typically 2-3 times daily, along     with cleansing the eyelids using warm water and applying topical antibiotics. If it does not resolve after massaging by the age of 6 to 1o months, lacrimal duct probing is done.
If probing fails, other treatment options include intubation with silastic tubing with or without balloon dilatation of the nasolacrimal duct and dacryocystorhinostomy.
other options:
option A: congenital entropion: This is a condition where the eyelid is turned inward, causing the eyelashes to rub against the cornea. This can lead to irritation, photophobia, and excessive tearing (lacrimation).
option B: Primary congenital glaucoma (PcG) is caused by impaired aqueous outflow due to a maldeveloped anterior chamber angle. clinically, the child presents with lacrimation,
photophobia, and blepharospasm.



option c: congenital distichiasis: This is a condition where an extra row of eyelashes grows from the meibomian glands on the eyelid margin. These extra lashes can irritate the cornea, leading to photophobia and tearing.",,D,
Q2,A construction site worker comes in with red eyes and lacrimation. He got chuna particles in his eyes an hour ago. what is the initial step in the treatment?,"a)Irrigation with normal saline
b)Topical antibiotics and cycloplegics
c)patch the eye after topical lubricants
d)Temporary tarsoraphy","The initial step in the management of a patient presenting with chemical burns is immediate and thorough irrigation with the available clean water or normal saline delivered through an IV
tubing. This is done to prevent further damage.
Along with irrigation, contaminant elimination through mechanical means shall be done. In the   event of residue, especially with lime (chuna), it is essential to meticulously eliminate them using a swab stick.
After the initial steps, maintenance of favorable conditions for rapid and uncomplicated healing by following measures:
• Topical antibiotic drops, for example, moxifloxacin 4-6 times a day to prevent infection.
• steroid eye drops to decrease inflammation, neutrophil infiltration, and treat anterior uveitis.
caution is advised after 2 weeks, as steroids could disrupt collagen synthesis.
• cycloplegics, such as atropine, might enhance comfort.
Grading of severity (Roper–Hall system) of chemical injuries is based on corneal clarity and severity of limbal ischemia:
• Grade 1  is characterized by a clear cornea (epithelial damage only) and no limbal ischemia (excellent prognosis).
• Grade 2 shows a hazy cornea but with visible iris detail and less than one-third of the limbus being ischemic (good prognosis).
• Grade 3 manifests as a total loss of the corneal epithelium, stromal haze obscuring iris detail, and between one-third and half of the limbus showing ischemia (guarded prognosis).
• Grade 4 manifests with an opaque cornea and more than 5o% of the limbus showing ischemia (poor prognosis).",,A,
Q3,what is anisometropia ?,"a)Difference in visual acuity
b)Difference in refractive power
c)Difference in axial length
d)Difference in size of eye ball","Anisometropia is the condition where there is difference in refractive powers of two eyes.
Anisometropia occurs when the total refraction of both eyes are unequal. A difference of 1D in the two eyes causes a 2% difference in the size of retinal images formed. A difference up to 2.5D is
well-tolerated, but beyond 4D cannot be tolerated. Anisometropia can occur as a combination of emmetropia, myopia, hypermetropia, and astigmatism.
It is diagnosed after retinoscopic examination and autorefractometry.
Treatment includes the usage of spectacles (it can be tolerated up to a maximum difference of 4D), contact lenses, intraocular lenses (for uniocular aphakia), refractive corneal surgery, or refractive



lens exchange methods (used in high degree anisometropia).",,B,
Q4,The following are features of third cranial nerve palsy except,"a)Elevation
b)Adduction
c)Limited abduction
d)ptosis","Limited abduction is not a feature of third cranial nerve palsy.
Abduction is carried out by the lateral rectus, which is supplied by the abducens (sixth) nerve. Third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy presents with:
• profound ptosis due to the weakness of the levator muscle
• Limited adduction due to medial rectus weakness
• Limited elevation due to the weakness of the superior rectus and inferior oblique
• Abduction and depression in the primary position (""down and out"")",,C,3046-1856.PNG
Q5,what is the most common cause of proptosis in middle aged individuals?,"a)Cavernous hemangioma
b)Orbital varix
c)Thyroid eye disease
d)Retinoblastoma","The most common cause of proptosis in middle age is thyroid eye disease.
Graves ophthalmopathy is one of the most serious ocular manifestations of Graves disease.
Between the ages of 25 and 5o, it's the leading cause of unilateral and bilateral proptosis in adults. proptosis, eyelid retraction, restricted myopathy, and perhaps compressive optic neuropathy are    clinical manifestations that could potentially be used for diagnosis.
The mechanism proposed for this is the acute precipitation of a hypothyroid state which leads to an increase in TSH secretion. This leads to stimulation of the retro-orbital fibroblasts and
adipocytes which have the receptor for TSH.
An abnormal protrusion of the globe is called proptosis. Exophthalmometry measures protrusion of the apex of the cornea from the outer orbital margin (with the eyes looking straight ahead). An



absolute protrusion of &gt;2o mm or a difference of &gt;2 mm between the two eyes is labelled as proptosis.
option A: cavernous hemangioma is the most common primary benign orbital tumor in adults.
They are composed of large, dilated vascular channels; are more infiltrative; frequently involve
deep structures; and do not spontaneously regress. on histologic examination, the mass is sharply delineated but unencapsulated with large, cavernous blood-filled vascular spaces, separated by
connective tissue stroma.
option B: The type of proptosis seen in orbital varix is non-pulsatile, intermittent, and reducible proptosis. on activities such as forward bending or lowering of the head, turning the head
forcefully, hyperextension of the neck, and coughing, the varices fill up, causing proptosis, and then, they regress on shifting to a non-dependent position.
option D: Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy in children. It is
associated with mutations in the RB1 gene at chromosome 13q14.  white pupillary reflex or
leukocoria is the most common presenting feature, followed by a squint which is usually
convergent. Histopathology of the tumor shows small round cells with large nuclei. Microscopic
features includes Flexner-wintersteiner rosettes(highly specific of retinoblastoma), Homer-wright rosettes, pseudorosettes, and fleurettes formation. Areas of necrosis and calcification can also be    seen.",,C,
Q6,A 4o year old with high myopia wearing thick glasses from childhood came with complaints of sudden onset of flashes of light in left eye. what could be the likely cause ?,"a)Retinal detachment
b)CRAO
c)CRVO
d)subarachnoid haemorrhage","The given scenario of patient with severe myopia presenting sudden onset of flashes of light is likely retinal detachment.
Retinal detachment is the separation of the neurosensory retina and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).
Risk factors include myopia, previous intraocular surgery such as aphakia or pseudophakia, a family history of retinal detachment, and trauma.
clinical features include sudden painless loss of vision, flashes of light or photopsia, floaters in the eye, and curtains in the field of vision.
Examination findings will reveal:
• Normal or slightly low intraocular pressure
• Marcus Gunn pupil (relative afferent pupillary defect)
• Altered red reflex on the distant direct ophthalmoscope
• Indirect ophthalmoscopy may show grey reflex of the freshly detached retina or breaks in the retina
• vitreous pigments on the anterior vitreous (shaffer sign)
• shifting fluid sign- change in the position of the detached area with a change in gravity is the hallmark of exudative retinal detachment.
Management of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment includes sealing of retinal breaks, reducing the vitreous traction on the retina, and flattening of the retina by draining the subretinal fluid.



scleral buckling, pneumatic retinopexy, and pars plana vitrectomy can help in maintaining the chorioretinal apposition.
Treating the cause helps in exudative retinal detachment. Enucleation can be done if intranuclear tumors are present.",,A,
Q7,"which of the following disease results in weakness of the levator palpebrae superioris, corneal anaesthesia, lagophthalmos, and ultimately blindness?","a)Lymels disease
b)Leprosy
c)Ophthamia neonatorum
d)Trachoma","Leprosy could result in paresis of the levator palpebrae superioris, corneal anaesthesia,
lagophthalmos, and ultimately blindness.
Lagophthalmos is the inability to close the eyelids. This can be due to the involvement of the zygomatic branch of the facial nerve (as in leprosy). other causes of lagophthalmos include    extreme proptosis and symblepharon. The decreased corneal sensation seen is due to the
involvement of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve which innervates the cornea.
Leprosy or Hansen disease is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by infection with
Mycobacterium leprae. ocular features in leprosy occur due to bacterial invasion and include corneal anesthesia, lagophthalmos, corneal ulceration, episcleritis, and iris atrophy. other
features seen are:
• keratitis with thickened, beaded corneal nerves, punctate subepithelial lesions, pannus, and vascularization
• chronic low-grade anterior uveitis
• Miosis
• Iris atrophy
• Iris pearls
• Retinal pearls
option B: The most common ocular manifestation in Lyme's disease is conjunctivitis. other    manifestations like keratitis, iridocyclitis, retinal vasculitis, choroiditis, optic neuropathy, and uveitis occurs very rarely.
option c: ophthalmia neonatarum also called neonatal conjunctivitis is inflammation of the
conjunctiva occurring in an infant &lt;3o days after birth. The clinical features include conjunctival redness, eyelid edema, and ocular discharge (purulent or mucopurulent).
option D: In trachoma, the symptoms include lacrimation, scanty mucoid discharge and foreign     body sensation. conjunctival congestion and follicles, papillary hyperplasia, Herbert follicles (seen in the limbal area), and progressive pannus are the characteristic features.",,B,
Q8,All of the following are actions of superior oblique except?,"a)Depression
b)Adduction
c)Abduction
d)Intorsion","Adduction is not an action of the superior oblique muscle.
The superior oblique muscle's primary, secondary and tertiary actions are intorsion, depression and abduction respectively.



It originates from the apex of the orbit, turns around the trochlea, and inserts into the sclera behind the equator. The oblique direction of the tendon is responsible for its rotatory effect   (intorsion), in addition to depression and abduction. It is supplied by the trochlear nerve.",,B,31-18.PNG
Q9,A patient presents with diminished night vision and the following finding was seen on fundoscopy. which of the following statements is not true regarding the condition?,"a)Dystrophy of rods more common than that of cones
b)ERG shows decreased amplitude of A and B waves
c)sometimes patients present in later stages with loss of peripheral vision.
d)Night blindness is a late feature","Diminished night vision along with fundoscopy features point to the diagnosis of retinitis
pigmentosa. option D is not true regarding retinitis pigmentosa. Night blindness is an early feature.
Retinitis pigmentosa is retinal dystrophy that results in degeneration of photoreceptors(rods more than cones). It can be inherited (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked recessive)  or acquired due to sporadic mutation in the rhodopsin gene. Fundoscopy shows bilateral,
mid-peripheral intraretinal perivascular 'bone-spicule' changes and atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium
patients present with worsening night blindness initially. However, patients do not often notice
night blindness and may present after much disease progression. They also develop tunnel vision, which manifests as difficulty performing activities of daily living such as reading, walking, and
driving.
ocular examination reveals normal visual activity and central vision (though central vision will be involved later in disease progression). Fundoscopy shows bilateral, mid-peripheral intraretinal
perivascular 'bone-spicule' changes and atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium. There is severe peripheral pigmentation, arteriolar narrowing, and pallor of the disc.
Retinitis pigmentosa can lead to posterior subcapsular cataracts, open-angle glaucoma,
keratoconus, and posterior vitreous detachment as possible complications.
There is no specific treatment for retinitis pigmentosa
option B:Electroretinography (ERG) is the record of changes in the resting potential of the eye induced by a flash of light.



waves of normal ERG
• a-wave: negative wave possibly arising from the rods and cones
• b-wave: large positive wave which is generated by Muller cells, but represents the activity of the bipolar cells
• c-wave: positive wave representing the metabolic activity of pigment epithelium
In retintis pigmentosa, it is abnormal and shows reduced scotopic, subnormal responses in early disease and becomes completely extinguished in advanced disease.",2960-1796.PNG,D,
Q10,"A patient of rheumatic heart disease presents with superior visual field defect in left eye since 1 week, what is the probable cause?","a)central retinal artery occlusion
b)central retinal vein occlusion
c)Branch retinal vein occlusion
d)Branch retinal artery occlusion","A patient with rheumatic heart disease (RHD) presenting with superior visual defects for the past one week is likely due to branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO).
Retinal artery occlusion usually occurs due to an embolus. Emboli can originate between the vasculature from the heart to the ophthalmic artery. Risk factors include Buerger’s disease,   hypertension, elevated lipid levels, cigarette smoking, RHD, and diabetes mellitus.
Retinal emboli can be of 3 types: cholesterol (Hollenhorst plaque), platelet-fibrin, and calcific. The emboli associated with cardiac thrombosis as seen in RHD are platelet-fibrin.
Features of BRAO:
• sudden painless loss of vision in one eye corresponding to the territory of the obstructed artery. Amaurosis fugax can be seen in patients with preexisting carotid disease.
• Retinal whitening is the most notable finding seen due to ischaemia of the inner layers of the retina. Cotton wool spots can also appear.
• Fluorescein angiography (FA) shows diminution in the dye distal to the site of obstruction. There may be some leaks visible at the site of the embolus.
• OCT (optical coherence tomography) initially shows hyperreflective and thickened inner layers of the retina in the obstructed territory, which start thinning out with time.
• Visual field testing is used to assess the extent of loss of vision.
No effective treatment has been found for BRAO. Ocular massage, lasers, or paracentesis can be used to disrupt the embolus. Vasodilation with inhaled amyl nitrite can be done.
In hypercoagulative states, prophylactic anticoagulation can be started to prevent future episodes. Other options:
Option A: Central retinal artery occlusion occurs due to obstruction at the level of lamina cribrosa. patient complains of sudden painless loss of vision occurring over seconds.
Option B: patients with CRVO usually complain of the acute onset of painless blurred vision in one eye. CRVO is seldom asymptomatic.
Option C: patients with BRVO typically present with peripheral visual field defects in the defective eye. However, in settings of RHD, arterial occlusion is more likely.",,D,
Q11,"An 8o yrs old patient presents with a painful, red right eye. On examination, the IOp of his right eye is 5ommHg and left eye is 16mmHg. slit lamp examination reveals deep anterior
chamber, presence of flare cells in the anterior chamber and cataractous lens in the right eye. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)phacolytic glaucoma
b)Malignant glaucoma
c)Fuch heterochromic iridocyclitis
d)phacomorphoic glaucoma","The given clinical scenario of an 8o year old presenting with painful red eyes, increased Iop and presence of a deep anterior chamber points towards the diagnosis of secondary open-angle
glaucoma - phacolytic glaucoma.
phacolytic glaucoma is secondary open-angle glaucoma occurring in association with hyper mature morgagnian cataracts.
Trabecular obstruction is caused by high molecular-weight lens proteins that leak through the intact capsule in cases ofthe hyper mature cataract into the aqueous humour; macrophages     containing lens proteins may also contribute to this.
presentation:
• Eye pain
• Diminished vision
• photophobia
• Lacrimation
• Headache
• Increased intraocular pressure
• Deep anterior chamber with fine white protein particles which may settle as pseudohypopyon
• open-angle seen on gonioscopy
• Lens: Milky white cortex with sunken brownish nucleus (Morgagnian cataract)
Treatment: Medical therapy to lower the intraocular pressure, surgery to extract the lens other options:
option B: Malignant glaucoma is seen after intraocular surgery such as trabeculectomy. The
forward flow of aqueous is blocked as the tips of ciliary processes rotate forward and press against the lens/IoL/anterior hyaloid of the vitreous. Hence, aqueous humor collects in the vitreous
cavity. There is persistent shallow or flat anterior chamber
option C: In Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis, the Iop is not usually so high.
option D: phacomorphic glaucoma is an acute secondary angle-closure glaucoma caused by an     intumescent cataractous lens due to rapid maturation of cataract or following traumatic capsular rupture. The swollen lens obliterates the angle by forcing the root of the iris against the cornea.   The patient presents with features of acute glaucoma with a shallow anterior chamber and a
swollen cataractous lens.",,A,
Q12,which of the following is a complication of diabetic retinopathy?,"a)posterior staphyloma
b)Retinoschisis
c)Tractional retinal detachment
d)progressive myopia","Tractional retinal detachment is a complication of diabetic retinopathy.
Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that affects the retina due to prolonged high blood sugar levels. over time, it can lead to several complications, including:



• Diabetic Macular Edema (DME): Diabetic retinopathy weakens the walls of the blood vessels in your retina, causing the leak of fluid and blood into the macula.
• vitreous Hemorrhage: New blood vessels can bleed into the vitreous. This bleeding prevents  light from reaching the retina. If the bleeding is minor, may present with floaters. However, in more severe cases, the blood can fill the vitreous cavity, completely obstructing your vision.
• Neovascular glaucoma: Abnormal blood vessels can grow out of the iris and can block fluid from draining properly, leading to a type of glaucoma.
• Tractional retinal detachment occurs due to the formation of fibrovascular tissue from
proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The fibrous tissue exerts traction on the retina, pulling it away from the underlying layers and causing a retinal detachment. The most common cause of
tractional retinal detachment is proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
other options
option A: posterior staphyloma is associated with progressive myopia.
option B: Retinoschisis refers to the splitting of the retinal layers and is seen in degenerative retinal diseases.
option D: progressive myopia is unrelated to diabetic retinopathy and occurs due to elongation of the eyeball, genetic factors, environmental factors and too much near work such as reading and
using digital devices for long hours.",,C,
Q13,which of the following is true about macular opacity?,"a)Iris and pupil are visible
b)Only the pupillary margin is visible
c)Iris details are visible
d)Iris and pupillary margins are not visible","Among the given options, ‘only the pupillary margin is visible’ is the true statement regarding macular opacity. Macular opacity is a type of corneal opacity.
Corneal macular opacity refers to a moderate to dense opacity in the cornea. In such cases, light transmission through the cornea is partially obstructed. This limits the visibility of deeper
structures like the iris and its fine details(options A &amp; C). However, because the pupillary      margin contrasts with its surrounding structures and lies directly behind the corneal opacity and the obstruction selectively allows the pupillary margin to be visible(options B &amp; D).",,B,
Q14,which of the following is true about viscoelastic substances?,"a)causes mechanical injury to corneal endothelium
b)prevents the Anterior chamber from collapsing during crucial steps like capsulorhexis and IOL placement
c)It is inert and can be left behind after surgery
d)Silicone oil, perfluoropropane, and SF6 are the most commonly used substances","viscoelastic substances prevent the anterior chamber from collapsing during crucial steps like capsulorhexis and IoL (Intra-ocular lens) placement.
viscoelastic substances are commonly used in ocular surgery, particularly in cataract surgery, to maintain the anterior chamber (AC), protect the corneal endothelium, and facilitate surgical
procedures. They prevent the collapse of the AC during crucial steps such as capsulorrhexis and IoL (intraocular lens) placement by providing a cushioning effect.
other options
option A: viscoelastic substances are typically used to protect the corneal endothelium, not to cause any mechanical injury.



option C: while some viscoelastics are inert, not all can be safely left behind. some types of
viscoelastic substances (especially those that are not fully biodegradable) should be removed from the eye after surgery to prevent complications.
option D: sodium hyaluronate and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose are the most commonly used viscoelastic substances, compared to silicone oil, perfluoropropane, and sF6.  silicone oil,
perfluoropropane, and sF6 are the substances used for vitreoretinal surgery (such as tamponade agents for retinal detachment), not for routine cataract surgery. viscoelastic used in cataract
surgery are typically substances like sodium hyaluronate and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.",,B,
Q15,"In pterygium, there is","a)Macular edema
b)Purulent discharge
c)Astigmatism","In pterygium, there is astigmatism. It causes astigmatism by flattening the cornea along the axis of the pterygium.
pterygium is a subconjunctival fibrovascular tissue encroaching on the cornea. It is a degenerative condition of the sub-conjunctival tissue and is never inflammatory. It occurs due to exposure to
Uv-B radiation and the most common site is the nasal.
It is made up of three parts - a ""cap"" (an avascular halo-like zone at the advancing edge), a head, and a body.
Clinical features:
• Astigmatism with the rule - most common finding
• stocker's line - deposition of iron on the advancing edge
• Fuchs islets - small, discrete, whitish flecks consisting of clusters of pterygial epithelial cells, often present at the advancing edge
The image below shows a pterygium.",,D,3158-1932.PNG
Q16,"A 6-month-old baby, born preterm at 33 weeks of gestation, is brought by parents with
complaints of white pupillary reflex since 2 weeks. cT revealed calcification of the globe in both eyes. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)ROP
b)Retinoblastoma
c)congenital Glaucoma
d)congenital cataract","The given clinical presentations of white pupillary reflex (leukocoria) and CT revealing calcification of the globe in both eyes is suggestive of retinoblastoma.
Retinoblastoma is a proliferation of neural cells that have failed to evolve normally. It arises from the neurosensory retina. It is a malignant tumour of the retina that typically presents in children, often before the age of 5. Leukocoria and squint are the most common presentation of
retinoblastoma.  It may also present as painful red eyes, cataracts, buphthalmos, proptosis(not microphthalmos) and pseudohypopyon.
In this case, the presence of calcification within the globe on a CT scan supports the diagnosis of retinoblastoma, as it is known to frequently show calcifications on imaging.


other options
option A: RoP (Retinopathy of Prematurity) is a concern in preterm infants (especially those born before 32 weeks), and it can also present with white pupillary reflex, it does not show calcification of the globe on a CT scan. RoP can lead to retinal detachment or fibrosis, but calcification is not a typical feature.
option C: Congenital glaucoma may present with symptoms such as enlarged corneas, increased    intraocular pressure, and a shallow anterior chamber. white pupillary reflex or calcification on CT are not typical presentations of congenital glaucoma.
option D: Congenital cataracts can present with leukocoria (white pupillary reflex) but would not  show calcification on a CT scan. They are more likely to be detected by a clinical examination and would typically not result in calcifications.",,B,3159-1933.PNG
Q17,which of the following is a cause of bilateral sudden painless loss of vision?,"a)Acute congestive glaucoma
b)Diabetic retinopathy
c)keratoconus
d)Iridocyclitis","Diabetic retinopathy is a cause of bilateral sudden painless loss of vision due to vascular complications.



Bilateral sudden painless loss of vision is a hallmark of advanced diabetic retinopathy, particularly when associated with complications such as:
• vitreous haemorrhage: Leakage of blood into the vitreous cavity due to rupture of fragile neovascular vessels.
• Tractional retinal detachment: occurs when fibrovascular tissue pulls the retina away from its underlying structures.
• Macular oedema: severe swelling in the macula can lead to central vision loss.
These conditions can cause sudden and significant visual impairment, often affecting both eyes in patients with long-standing, poorly controlled diabetes.
other options
option A: Acute congestive glaucoma: Typically causes sudden vision loss, but it is painful and unilateral in most cases.
option C: keratoconus is a progressive condition that leads to gradual vision loss due to corneal thinning and irregular astigmatism, not sudden or bilateral loss.
option D: Iridocyclitis is associated with pain, redness, and photophobia, and it is usually unilateral.",,B,
Q18,"In FFA, the microaneurysms appear as:","a)Hypofluorescent dots
b)Hyperfluorescent dots
c)Hypofluorescent lines
d)Hyperfluorescent branching-like structures in the vessel","In Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA), microaneurysms (a hallmark of diabetic retinopathy) appear as hyperfluorescent dots due to the accumulation of fluorescein dye in the localized
dilations of retinal capillaries.


other options:
option A: Hypofluorescent dots indicate blocked fluorescence, often due to hemorrhage or ischemia.



Option C: Hypofluorescent line might occur in cases of vascular occlusion.
Option D: Hyperfluorescent branching-like structure in the vessel suggests leakage from neovascularization or vascular abnormalities.",,B,3160-1934.PNG
Q19,Normal diameter of artery to vein at the optic disc margin,"a)1:3
b)2:3
c)2:5
d)1:5","The normal diameter ratio of the central retinal artery to the central retinal vein at the optic disc margin is 2:3.
The ratio 2:3 means that the artery’s diameter is approximately two-thirds of the vein’s diameter. This is considered the physiological normal. The ratio is assessed during the fundoscopic
examination, and significant deviations can indicate pathological conditions:
• Decreased ratio (arteriolar narrowing) may suggest hypertension or arteriosclerosis.
• Increased ratio (relative venous narrowing) is less common but may occur in rare conditions.",,B,
Q20,"In the case of Best disease, which of the following is the diagnostic investigation?","a)EOG
b)ERG
c)Multifocal ERG
d)visual evoked potential","EOG (electrooculogram) is the diagnostic investigation in the case of Best disease. EOG measures the function of the retinal pigment epithelium (RpE), which is typically abnormal in Best disease, even in asymptomatic carriers. The Arden ratio is significantly reduced (&lt;1.8) in affected
individuals.
Best's disease/vitelliform macular dystrophy is an inherited macular dystrophy in which lipofuscin accumulates in the central macula causing progressive central vision loss. It is
autosomal-dominant and linked to the mutation in the bestrophin (vMD2) gene.
It is characterized by bilateral yellow, yolk-like (vitelliform) macular lesions.
The stages of evolution of the macular lesions are described as progressing from:
• pre-vitelliform stage
• vitelliform stage- scrambled egg stage with or without hypopyon
• vitelliruptive- the lesion breaks and visual acuity drops
• The atrophic stage
patients with Best’s disease usually have good visual acuity when the ""yolk"" remains intact.
Diagnosis: This is the only disease with relatively normal ERG (electroretinogram) results
associated with an abnormal EOG. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) reveals that the
vitelliform material appears as a dome-shaped, hyperreflective, and homogenous lesion, located below the hyperreflective photoreceptor layer.
The image below shows Best’s disease - the typical vitelliform lesion
other options
option B: ERG (electroretinogram) assesses retinal activity and is mainly used in diagnosing
pigmentary retinal dystrophy, complete occlusion of the retinal artery, early glaucomatous
damage, macular degeneration in cataract, complete old retinal detachment or advanced siderosis.
option c: Multifocal ERG assesses retinal activity and mainly provides a detailed evaluation of the central retina as in stargardt disease or chloroquine toxicity.
option D: Visual evoked potential (VEP) is used to evaluate the visual pathway’s function",,A,3162-1935.PNG
Q21,A factory worker presented with a chemical injury in both his eyes a few hours back. what is the first immediate management?,"a)copious irrigation of eyes
b)Take history
c)check vision in both eyes
d)check IOP and plan for surgery","copious irrigation of the eyes is the first immediate management in this case.
The initial step in the management of a patient presenting with chemical burns is immediate and thorough irrigation with the available clean water or normal saline delivered through an IV
tubing. This is done to prevent further damage.
Along with irrigation, contaminant elimination through mechanical means shall be done. In the   event of residue, especially with lime (chuna), it is essential to meticulously eliminate them using a swab stick.
