Q1,A female presents with loss of vision in the right halves of both eyes. where is the lesion located in the optic pathway?,"a)Left optic tract
b)optic radiation
c)optic chiasma
d)Right optic tract","visual loss in the right halves of both eyes is suggestive of right homonymous hemianopia. The site of the lesion in this case is the left optic tract.
Here, vision is lost in the right half of both eyes, which means:
• in the left eye, the nasal visual field is lost, and
• in the right eye, the temporal visual field is lost.
It means left temporal and right nasal fibers are destroyed, which leads to right homonymous hemianopia. Anatomically, this can be explained by the fact that each optic tract contains
fibers from the ipsilateral temporal half of the retina and the contralateral nasal half of the retina.
optic tract lesions can occur due to pituitary adenomas (most common), craniopharyngioma, tumors of the optic thalamus, large aneurysm of superior cerebellar or posterior cerebral
arteries, demyelinating diseases, and infarction.
other options:
option B: optic radiation lesions result in contralateral homonymous hemianopia, which means that the visual loss would occur in the left halves of both eyes rather than the right halves, as
described in the question.
option C: Lesions at the optic chiasma typically cause bitemporal hemianopia, which involves visual loss in the outer (temporal) halves of the visual field in both eyes. This is not consistent with the patient's described symptoms.
option D: A lesion in the right optic tract would result in left homonymous hemianopia, causing  visual loss in the left halves of both eyes. This does not match the patient's presentation of vision loss in the right halves of both eyes.",,A,3064-1874.PNG
Q2,A 65-year-old diabetic woman presents with painless loss of vision. The ocular findings are shown in the image below. what is the likely diagnosis and management for this patient?,"a)zonular cataract and lensectomy
b)Rosette cataract and sugar control
c)sunflower cataract and lesion extraction
d)Immature senile cataract and phacoemulsification with IoL","The given clinical scenario and the above image are suggestive of an immature senile cataract and the appropriate treatment is phacoemulsification with posterior intraocular lens implantation.



An immature senile cataract is characterized by partial opacification of the lens. The cuneiform
and cupuliform patterns of opacification are seen and the lens appears greyish-white. Iris shadow is visible. slit-lamp examination shows areas of the normal and cataractous cortex.
The treatment of choice for immature senile cataracts is treated by extracapsular cataract
extraction by phacoemulsification and foldable posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. other options:
option A: zonular cataract is a developmental type of cataract in which opacification occupies a     discrete zone in the lens. It is the most common type of congenital cataract presenting with visual impairment. Lensectomy is the treatment of choice for congenital cataracts.
option B: Rosette cataract presents after close globe injuries (blunt trauma) resulting in damage   to the lens fibers and capsule resulting in hydration of lens fibers by aqueous humor. This results in opacification of the posterior subcapsular cortex along the posterior sutures. It presents as a
flower-shaped opacification. Iridodialysis occurs due to dehiscence of the iris from the ciliary body at its root. The pupil becomes D-shaped. surgery is recommended in case of visual impairment.
option C: sunflower cataract is seen in wilson disease due to the deposition of cuprous oxide in the anterior lens capsule and subcapsular cortex in a stellate pattern. D-penicillamine is an
effective treatment modality.",3111-1909.PNG,D,
Q3,which of the following refractive errors is associated with the image given below?,"a)presbyopia
b)Astigmatism
c)Hypermetropia
d)Myopia","The given image is a sturm's conoid. It represents the configuration of a bundle of light rays
formed by a regularly astigmatic (toric) surface and helps in understanding the optics of regular astigmatism.
Astigmatism is a type of refractive error that occurs when light rays enter the eye at different planes and converge at different points forming focal lines.
when light passes through a regularly astigmatic surface (surface with toric curvature), vertical
and horizontal rays converge at different points and form two focal lines. The shape of a bundle of light rays at different points is as follows:
For the given sturm's conoid,
• At point A, a horizontal oval is formed because vertical rays converge more rapidly than horizontal rays.
• At point B (first focus), vertical rays come to a focus, while horizontal rays are still converging;
so, it will be a horizontal straight line.
• At points C, D, and E, the vertical rays are diverging, and horizontal rays are still converging.
• At point D, the vertical rays have diverged as much as the horizontal rays have converged; so, we get a perfect circle called the circle of least diffusion.
• At point E, a vertical oval is formed.
• At point F (second focus), a vertical straight line is formed
• At point G and beyond, both rays are diverging, and we always get a vertical oval/ prolate ellipse.



• The focal interval of sturm refers to the distance between two foci (B and F).
The image is clearest or least confusing as point D, the circle of least confusion/ circle of diffusion. The circle of diffusion lies at the mid-point of this interval.


• option A: presbyopia is a refractive error caused by the loss of elasticity of the crystalline lens,    leading to difficulty in focusing on near objects. presbyopia is not associated with sturm's conoid.
• option C: Hypermetropia, or farsightedness, is a refractive error in which the eye does not focus incoming light properly, causing near objects to appear blurry. It is not associated with sturm's
conoid.
• option D: Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a refractive error in which distant objects appear blurry because the eye focuses light in front of the retina rather than on it. Myopia is not associated with  sturm's conoid.",3112-1911.PNG,B,3118-1914.PNG
Q4,A 5-year-old boy presents with a small nodule on the sclera as shown in the image below. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)pterygium
b)pinguecula
c)Dermolipoma
d)Dermoid","A dermoid is a likely diagnosis based on the ocular finding and the given image.
An orbital dermoid is a choristoma (a mass of histologically normal tissue in an abnormal location) formed due to subcutaneous displacement of the ectoderm.
It is lined by keratinized stratified squamous epithelium and contains dermal appendages like sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and hair follicles. It can be located anteriorly (superficial) or   posteriorly (deep) to the orbital septum.
Clinical features: superficial dermoid presents in infancy as a painless nodule in the
superotemporal part of the orbit whereas deep dermoid presents in adulthood as a gradually protruding eye or acutely as an inflamed orbit. CT imaging would show a well-circumscribed cystic lesion.
Treatment is by excision in toto.
other options:



option A: pterygium is a triangular fibrovascular ingrowth of degenerative bulbar conjunctival tissue on the limbus as a result of chronic exposure to Uv rays.
option B: pinguecula is an asymptomatic yellow-white mound of degenerated conjunctival stroma seen adjacent to the limbus. It is more common on the nasal limbus.
option C: Dermolipoma presents in adulthood as a subconjunctival yellowish mass near the outer canthus of the eye. It contains dermal appendages and fatty tissue.",3112-1910.PNG,D,
Q5,The eye examination of a 2o-year-old male shows a golden ring on the iris. what is the next investigation to diagnose the condition?,"a)Alpha-1-antitrypsin
b)Alpha-fetoprotein
c)serum iron
d)serum ceruloplasmin","The given image shows a kayser-Fleischer ring, which is seen in wilson's disease. Low serum ceruloplasmin level is diagnostic of wilson's disease.
wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is an inherited metabolic disorder resulting due to abnormal copper deposition in tissues (mainly the liver and brain). It is caused by a deficiency of ceruloplasmin (copper-carrying blood protein).
kayer-Fleischer ring is a brownish-yellow zone of copper deposition that is present in
the peripheral Descemet membrane.


The ring is best seen on gonioscopy. penicillamine therapy may cause the ring to disappear. Another ocular finding in wilson's disease is anterior capsular sunflower cataract.
other options:
option A: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency leads to lung and liver disease.
option B: Alpha-fetoprotein is a diagnostic marker in hepatocellular carcinoma.
option C: serum iron level is assessed in hemochromatosis which occurs due to increased iron deposition in various tissues. The ocular manifestation includes dry eye and rusty-brown
perilimbal and conjunctival discoloration.",,D,3119-1915.PNG
Q6,what is the dye and filter used to diagnose corneal ulcers?,"a)Lissamine dye - green filter
b)Lissamine dye - cobalt blue filter
c)Fluorescein dye - visualized under green filter
d)Fluorescein dye - visualized under cobalt blue filter","The image given is of a dendritic ulcer seen in recurrent herpetic keratitis. corneal ulcers can be detected with the help of fluorescein sodium dye and a cobalt-blue filter. The epithelial defect of the cornea appears opaque green with a cobalt blue filter.
Fluorescein staining of the cornea is carried out with a disposable autoclaved filter paper strip
impregnated with the dye. The denuded epithelial area seen in corneal abrasions or ulcers
appears brilliant green when stained with fluorescein. under a cobalt blue light, the stained area appears opaque green.
Other options:
Lissamine green dye is used to stain devitalized cells of the cornea and conjunctiva. It is used to diagnose ocular surface disorders, like dry eye.",3113-1912.PNG,D,
Q7,An infant is brought with complaints of excessive watering of the eyes and photophobia. The image is given below. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)congenital glaucoma
b)congenital cataract
c)Mucopolysaccharidosis
d)ophthalmia neonatorum","The clinical scenario of excessive watering and photophobia in an infant and the given image with corneal enlargement and haze suggest a likely diagnosis of congenital glaucoma.
Primary congenital glaucoma (PcG) is caused by impaired aqueous outflow due to a maldeveloped anterior chamber angle.
It can be classified as
• True congenital glaucoma - IOP is elevated during intrauterine life.
• Infantile glaucoma - manifests before 3 years of age.
• Juvenile glaucoma (least common) - IOP rises between 3 and 16 years of age.
clinically, the child presents with lacrimation, photophobia, and blepharospasm.
PcG may also present with:
• corneal haze (due to diffuse edema secondary to raised IOP)
• Buphthalmos (a large eye that results from stretching due to raised IOP before 3 years of age). The thin sclera appears blue due to underlying uveal tissue.
• Haab striae (curvilinear healed breaks in Descemet's membrane)
• corneal scarring
• Optic disc cupping
Evaluation is done under general anesthesia. Initially, IOP measurement is performed (1o–12    mmHg is normal). A corneal diameter measuring greater than 12 mm is highly suggestive of an infant under the age of 1 year.
Management is essentially surgical and goniotomy and/or trabeculectomy may be done.
Other options:



option B: Congenital cataract occurs due to disturbance in lens growth leading to the
development of opaque lens fibers. It can be idiopathic, hereditary, or secondary to metabolic disorders and infections. It presents with leukocoria (white reflex in the pupillary area),
wandering eye movement, squint, and nystagmus.
option C: Mucopolysaccharidoses are inherited metabolic disorders presenting with corneal opacification, pigmentary retinopathy, glaucoma, and optic atrophy.
option D: ophthalmia neonatorum presents in neonates with conjunctival discharge and chemosis, and tenderness of the eyeball secondary to infections.",3057-1865.PNG,A,
Q8,"A 6o-year-old patient complains of decreased distant vision but now he does not use
spectacles for near vision. The image of his ocular examination is given below. what is this type of refractive error called?","a)Index myopia
b)Axial myopia
c)curvatural myopia
d)positional myopia","The most likely diagnosis based on the given clinical scenario and the image is index myopia seen in nuclear senile cataracts.
Index myopia occurs due to an increase in the refractive index of the crystalline lens due to
nuclear sclerosis. Nuclear sclerosis is an ageing process in which the lens becomes hard and
inelastic resulting in an increase in the refractive index, causing progressive myopia (decreased
distant vision). A patient with presbyopia may be able to read again, without the aid of spectacles. This improvement in vision is termed second sight.
other options:
option B: Axial myopia is the most common type of myopia resulting due to an increase in the anteroposterior length of the eyeball.
option C: Curvatural myopia results due to increased curvature of the cornea, lens, or both.
option D: positional myopia results due to anterior placement of the crystalline lens in the eye.",3115-1913.PNG,A,
