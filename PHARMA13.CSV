Atropine in larger doses can lead to atropine toxicity. The features are depicted in the following image:
Solution to Question 12:
The mechanism of action of the tissue plasminogen activator is to enhance fibrin degradation.
Tissue plasminogen activators activate plasminogen bound to fibrin, and catalyze the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, resulting in increased formation of plasmin. This results in fibrinolysis of formed thrombus (thrombolysis).
It is indicated in pulmonary embolism with hemodynamic instability, acute ischemic stroke, and acute myocardial infarction. Recombinant variants of t-PA like reteplase and tenecteplase have a longer half-life.
All thrombolytics can cause bleeding, which may be counteracted by the administration of antifibrinolytics, such as aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid.",,A,1245-788.PNG
