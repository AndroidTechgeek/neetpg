Q1,"A 2o-year-old male patient presented with a history of lower backache and early morning
stiffness for two years. He also gave a history of bilateral heel pain since 6 months. which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Ankylosing spondylitis
b)Tuberculosis of spine
c)Disc prolapse
d)Mechanical pain","The given clinical scenario of a young male presenting with lower backache, heel pain, and early morning stiffness is suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis.



Ankylosing spondylitis is commonly seen in young males and has a strong association
with HLAB27. The patient usually presents with complaints of recurring backache and early
morning stiffness. Later the patient can develop other symptoms like generalized fatigue, pain, swelling of the joints, foot strain, tenderness at insertion of the achilles tendon, and intercostal pain.
Extra-articular manifestations include iritis, pericarditis, aortic incompetence, apical lobe fibrosis, generalized osteoporosis, and atlantoaxial joint subluxation.
on examination, there is a loss of normal lumbar lordosis, increased thoracic kyphosis, diminished spinal movements, and decreased chest expansion.
other findings are:
• positive Fleche's test - It is done to assess cervical spine involvement. Here the patient is asked to touch the wall with the back of the head without raising the chin.
• positive tests for sacroiliac joint involvement such as the pump handle test, pelvic compression test, and Fabre’s test.
ASAS diagnostic criteria for ankylosing spondylitis:

X-ray findings in ankylosing spondylitis:
• Sacro-iliac joints:



Cardinal sign/earliest sign   erosion and fuzziness of the sacroiliac joints Later- peri-articular sclerosis and bony ankylosis of the joint
vertebral changes:
Earliest- flattening of the normal anterior concavity of the vertebral body ( squaring )
Later- ossification of the ligaments around the intervertebral discs produces syndesmophytes (bridges) between adjacent vertebrae
Bamboo spine appearance- due to bridging at several vertebral levels
Long-standing cases are associated with osteoporosis. wedging of the vertebral bodies produces hyperkyphosis of the spine.
progressive bony ankylosis or erosive arthritis may be seen in peripheral joints. Bamboo-spine appearance is seen in the xray of the lumbar spine below:


other options:
option B: TB spine (pott's disease) is the commonest form of bone and joint tuberculosis. The
clinical presentation can be variable with pain being the common symptom. The pain can be
diffuse initially but later on, it gets localized to the affected segment. stiffness is also seen as an    early symptom. The patient can also present with swelling due to the formation of a cold abscess. paraplegia and spinal deformities can occur at later stages.
option C: Disc prolapse refers to protrusion or extrusion of the nucleus pulposus through a rent     in the annulus fibrosis. The patient presents with low backache which can be acute or chronic. The patient can also present with pain radiating to the gluteal region, back of the thigh, and leg. This is referred to as sciatic pain. There can be paraesthesia in the dermatomes of the affected nerve
roots.
option D: Mechanical back pain is a broader term that includes all the causes that cause
alternation in the spine mechanics. It includes conditions like osteoarthritis, lumbar spondylosis, osteoporosis, etc.",,A,5369-3410.PNG;5368-3409.PNG
Q2,A 5-year-old child was brought to the pediatrician with complaints of bilateral knee joint pain. The x-ray image of the joints is given below. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)scurvy
b)Rickets
c)Metaphyseal dysplasia
d)pycnodysostosis","The clinical presentation and the x-ray showing pelkan spurs, Trummerfeld zone, and Frenkel's line are suggestive of scurvy.
Rickets can also present with bilateral knee pain, but normal bone mineral density, lack of
radiographical signs such as cupping and fraying of the metaphysis and widening of the growth plate makes it an unlikely diagnosis.
Radiological findings in scurvy:
• Frenkel's line - The zone of provisional calcification at the growing metaphysis is seen as a dense, white line called the Frankel's line.
• pelkan spurs - These are metaphyseal spurs formed due to fractures manifesting at the cortical margins.
• wimberger’s ring sign - The sclerotic rim around the epiphysis forms this appearance.
• Trummerfeld zone. - Lucent metaphyseal band underlying Frankel line.


scurvy results from vitamin C deficiency, which is required for the hydroxylation of lysine and
proline in procollagen. There is a defective formation of connective tissue and collagen in the skin, bone, cartilage, dentine, and blood vessels leading to their fragility.
Early manifestations include irritability, loss of appetite, musculoskeletal pain, and tenderness in the legs. Later on, the child can have swelling of the knees, ankles, and pseudo paralysis.
Hemorrhagic manifestations of scurvy include petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses at pressure points, epistaxis, gum bleeding, and characteristic perifollicular hemorrhages.
other manifestations are poor wound and fracture healing, hyperkeratosis of hair follicles,
arthralgia, and muscle weakness. It also results in defective osteoid formation. Costo-chondral   separation leads to the formation of tender nodules, which are sharply angulated also known as the scorbutic rosary.



other options:
option B: The findings in rickets are given in the pearl below.
option C: Metaphyseal dysplasia (pyle's disease) is an autosomal recessive condition caused due to failure of remodeling of the metaphysis. Erlenmeyer flask deformities of the distal femur and  proximal tibia are seen in this condition. The patient can also develop genu valgum.
option D: pycnodysostosis is an autosomal recessive condition due to a mutation in the cathepsin K (CTSK) gene. It causes osteosclerosis and the affected individual has distinctive facial features    and skeletal malformations. The patient has short stature and is prone to recurrent fractures due  to their fragile bones.",5365-3407.PNG,A,5371-3411.PNG
Q3,The following test is done to assess,"a)posterior interosseous nerve
b)Median nerve
c)ulnar nerve
d)Musculocutaneous nerve","The given image shows the pen test which is used to assess the median nerve.
It tests the abductor pollicis brevis muscle which is supplied by the median nerve. The hand must  remain flat with the palm facing upwards; a pen is held above the palm and the patient is asked to touch the pen with his thumb - positive sign is unable to touch the pen.
Median nerve lesions can be high lesions or low lesions depending on the site of injury.
Low lesions - It occurs due to injuries at the distal third of the forearm such as carpal dislocation   or cut wound of the wrist.  There is paralysis of the hand muscles; the patient is unable to abduct   the thumb and has a loss of sensation over the radial three-and-a-half digits. The forearm muscles supplied by the median nerve are spared in these lesions. wasting of thenar eminence is seen in     long-standing cases.
High lesions - It occurs due to injuries above the elbow such as forearm fractures or elbow
dislocation. There is paralysis of the forearm muscles along with all the features of low lesions.
Muscles supplied by the median nerve are given in the table:
other tests for median nerve:
pointing index sign or oschner’s clasp test: The patient is asked to clasp both hands together.
when this is done the index and the middle finger fail to flex due to the loss of action of long finger flexors which are supplied by the median nerve.
Benediction test: Due to loss of activity of the long finger flexors the patient is unable to flex the index and middle finger on lifting the hand. As this is the position a clergyman uses to bless the couple during the marriage, it is called the benediction test.

Q4,A 3o-year-old male patient presented with complaints of a gradually progressive swelling    around his wrist joint for 3 months. Given below is the image of the swelling and the X-ray film. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Ewing's sarcoma
b)osteosarcoma
c)osteoclastoma
d)osteochondroma","The clinical presentation and the x-ray showing an eccentric expansile lesion with a soap bubble appearance in a 3o-year-old man are suggestive of osteoclastoma or giant cell tumor (GCT).
osteoclastoma usually affects young adults in the age group of 2o-4o years. The most common     location of the tumor is the distal femur followed by the proximal tibia. Involvement of the distal end of the radius is also seen and the tumor is more aggressive in this location.
Radiographic findings in GCT:
• A solitary, possibly loculated, lytic lesion in the epiphysis
• Eccentric location, most often subchondral
• Expansion of the overlying cortex
• soap bubble appearance - The tumor is homogeneously lytic with trabeculae of the remnants of bone traversing it, giving it a loculated appearance called soap bubble appearance
• No calcification within the tumor
• No or minimal reactive sclerosis around the tumor.
Treatment :
• Extended curettage and bone grafting.
• En-bloc wide resection and reconstruction are done for advanced stages, local recurrence, and tumors not responding to other methods.
• Resection without reconstruction is done for lesions in expandable bones like distal ulna, clavicle, etc.
• Irradiation and/or embolization are used for inoperable lesions in the spine and pelvis.
• Bisphosphonates have been shown to reduce the proliferation of osteoclasts and hence have been shown to stabilize local and metastatic disease.
• Denosumab is approved for use in unresectable tumors in skeletally mature patients.
other options:
option A: Ewing's sarcoma is a primary malignant tumor of the bone commonly involving the age group of 4-25 years involving the diaphysis of the long bones like the femur, tibia, fibula, and
humerus.
X-ray shows onion-peel appearance due to deposition of periosteal reaction in layers is the typical finding.





option B: osteosarcoma is the most common non-hematologic primary malignancy of bone. It
occurs most commonly in the second decade of life and is typically metaphyseal. The distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus are the common sites.
X-ray shows periosteal reaction and it may take the form of a codman's triangle or have a sunburst (sunray) appearance.


option D: osteochondromas are common benign bone tumors. The lesions consist of a bony mass, often in the form of a stalk, produced by endochondral ossification of a growing
cartilaginous cap. The common sites of involvement are the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus.",5367-3408.PNG,C,5374-3412.PNG;5304-3352.PNG;5375-3413.PNG
Q5,"A patient was brought to the hospital with complaints of pain around the left hip joint
following a road traffic accident. on examination, the affected limb was flexed, adducted, and medially rotated with obvious shortening. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Anterior hip dislocation
b)posterior hip dislocation
c)Transcervical fracture
d)Intertrochanteric fracture","The given clinical vignette showing a flexed, adducted, and medially rotated limb with apparent limb shortening following trauma is suggestive of posterior hip dislocation.
posterior hip dislocation is the most common type of hip dislocation commonly seen following dashboard injuries.
X-ray findings:
• upward dislocation of the femoral head
• Femoral head appears smaller than normal
• Lesser trochanter is not visualized as the thigh is internally rotated
• Femoral head and posterior acetabular wall fractures may also be seen.
Treatment: Early reduction should be done as the risk of osteonecrosis and subsequent osteoarthritis increases with time.
closed reduction under sedation or general anesthesia is done in most cases. closed
reduction should not be attempted in associated femoral neck fractures as it can lead to the displacement of the femoral neck and disrupt the blood supply to the femoral head.
If there is a failure of closed reduction or any significant fractures then surgical repair should be done. If there is a delay in surgical correction skeletal traction with a distal femoral traction pin  can be done.
Early complications include sciatic nerve injury, vascular injury (superior gluteal artery tear can occur), and concurrent femoral shaft fracture (when both occur together hip dislocation may be  missed).
Late complications include osteonecrosis of the femoral head, myositis ossificans, secondary osteoarthritis, and recurrent instability.



The image given below shows posterior hip dislocation on the left side.


other options:
option A: Anterior hip dislocations are less common than posterior hip dislocations. This injury is usually sustained following a high-energy accident. The affected limb will be abducted, externally   rotated, and slightly flexed.


option C: Transcervical fracture is a type of fracture neck of the femur where the fracture line is in the middle of the neck. In this case, there can be shortening and external rotation of the affected    limb.





option D: Intertrochanteric fracture is usually sustained following a fall or road traffic accident.   The leg is short and externally rotated. clinical findings are more marked than the neck of femur fractures.",,B,5376-3414.PNG;5377-3416.PNG;5377-3415.PNG
Q6,"A 28-year-old man presented with complaints of backache, morning stiffness, and redness of  the eyes. An X-ray image of the spine is given below. which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Rheumatoid arthritis
b)paget's disease
c)osteopetrosis
d)Ankylosing spondylitis","The clinical presentation of a young male with backache, morning stiffness, redness of the eye, and the x-ray showing the classical bamboo-spine appearance are suggestive of ankylosing
spondylitis.
Ankylosing spondylitis commonly involves young male adults. It has a strong association with HLAB27.
Radiographic findings in ankylosing spondylitis:



• Sacro-iliac joints:
• cardinal sign/earliest sign– erosion and fuzziness of the sacroiliac joints
• Later- peri-articular sclerosis and bony ankylosis of the joint
• vertebral changes:
• Earliest- flattening of the normal anterior concavity of the vertebral body (‘squaring’)
• Later- ossification of the ligaments around the intervertebral discs produces syndesmophytes (bridges) between adjacent vertebrae
• Bamboo spine appearance- due to bridging at several vertebral levels
• Long-standing cases are associated with osteoporosis. wedging of the vertebral bodies produces hyperkyphosis of the spine.
• Progressive bony ankylosis or erosive arthritis may be seen in peripheral joints. ASAS diagnostic criteria for ankylosing spondylitis:

other options:
option A: Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease with an increased incidence
between 25 and 55 years of age. clinical features include swelling and pain in the small joints of  the hands. Metacarpophalangeal (McP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are commonly



involved. The patient also has morning stiffness in the affected joints.
option B: paget's disease, also known as osteitis deformans is characterized by an increased bone turnover due to a disorganized, alternating, and increased rate of osteoblastic and osteoclastic
activity. It is seen more commonly in people over the age of 5o and most of the patients are     asymptomatic. symptomatic patients present with pain or deformity, with the pelvis and tibia being the commonly involved sites.
option C: osteopetrosis/Albers–schönberg disease occurs due to a defect in the genes that control the osteoclastic activity. It can be of two types:
• Infantile form( autosomal recessive)- The infant presents with growth retardation, abnormal skull development, failure to thrive, and genu valgum. pancytopenia and hepatosplenomegaly occur as a result of obliteration of the medullary canals and the subsequent extra-medullary    hemopoiesis
• Adult form (autosomal dominant) - The patient can be asymptomatic or can present with recurrent fractures and compressive neuropathies. Hemopoiesis is unaffected.",5368-3409.PNG,D,5369-3410.PNG
