Q1,what is the diagnosis?,"a)Intraocular foreign body
b)pseudoexfoliation syndrome
c)ocular trauma
d)vossius ring","The diagnosis based on the image given is pseudoexfoliation syndrome.
pseudoexfoliation syndrome is an age-related degenerative disorder, more commonly seen in
women. It is marked by the deposition of exfoliative material on the iris, ciliary region, and lens capsule. They appear as flakes on the anterior lens capsule and edge of the iris.
The material can get collected in the anterior chamber angle and impede the aqueous humor drainage. patients affected by this condition are at an increased risk of developing
open-angle glaucoma. Rarely, angle-closure glaucoma can also be seen. other ocular symptoms include iris sphincter atrophy, anisocoria, and heterochromia. systemic manifestations due to    abnormal fibrillary deposition may also be seen.
other options:
option A - Common intraocular foreign bodies include glass particles or metal chips. It can lodge in various sites like the anterior chamber, lens, posterior chamber, and vitreous. This can lead to  cataract formation, retinal hemorrhages, and tears. organic foreign bodies can cause infection.
Iron foreign bodies can cause siderosis while copper ones can result in chalcosis. An entry wound can be identified with topical fluorescein.  In cases of metallic intraocular foreign bodies, MRI is   contraindicated. CT scan can be done instead.





option C - ocular trauma can be a closed-globe or open-globe injury. Closed-globe injury can vary from simple corneal abrasions to widespread intraocular damage. open-globe injuries include
globe rupture or laceration.
A corneal abrasion highlighted with fluorescein staining is shown below.


option D - vossius ring is used to describe a ring-shaped pigment dispersal observed on the
anterior surface of the lens due to the deposition of brown amorphous pigment granules. It is
close to the miosed pupil in diameter. The force of the blow drives the cornea and iris backward, creating an impression of the iris on the lens.",3096-1894.PNG,B,3100-1899.PNG;3100-1898.PNG;3101-1900.PNG
Q2,A patient presents with a history of penetrating injury to the eye. A diagnosis of sympathetic ophthalmitis was confirmed. which of the following will be seen?,"a)Acute anterior uveitis
b)pars planitis
c)panuveitis
d)chronic anterior uveitis","panuveitis is the usual clinical manifestation seen in sympathetic ophthalmitis. panuveitis is inflammation of the whole uvea.
sympathetic ophthalmitis is a granulomatous pan-uveitis that usually occurs after penetrative trauma. It can also develop after intraocular surgery. Both the injured eye (exciting eye) and
fellow eye (sympathizing eye) develop panuveitis. Trauma to the ciliary region (dangerous zone) poses an increased risk.
It is a type 4 hypersensitivity reaction. According to the allergic theory, the uveal pigment in the injured eye acts as an allergen that causes uveitis in the other eye. Dalen-Fuchs nodules
(proliferation of pigment epithelium), exudative retinal detachment, and optic disc swelling can be seen on fundoscopy. A sunset glow appearance can persist due to residual chorioretinal scarring.
Dalen-Fuchs nodules are depicted in the image below.





The exciting eye shows features of low-grade uveitis such as ciliary congestion, lacrimation, and tenderness. The sympathizing eye is usually involved 4-8 weeks later. It has a prodromal stage   with photophobia, ciliary congestion, and keratic precipitates. In the fully developed stage,
symptoms of acute iridocyclitis supervene.
prophylactic measures to be taken before the condition sets in include topical or systemic steroids and antibiotics. Early excision of the injured eye is carried out if it cannot be salvaged. once
sympathetic ophthalmitis has already set in, enucleation of the injured eye must be done.
Atropine, immunosuppressants, and corticosteroids should also be administered. other options:
options A and D: Anterior uveitis is inflammation of the iris up to pars plicata. keratic
precipitates are characteristic of the condition. Acute anterior uveitis, which can last for 6 weeks   to 3 months, presents with pain, photophobia, and lacrimation. chronic anterior uveitis lasts for   longer than 6 months. Anterior uveitis is associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, sarcoidosis, and ankylosing spondylitis.
The image below shows keratic precipitates.





option B: Pars planitis or intermediate uveitis is an inflammatory condition that affects the pars    plana of the ciliary body, the peripheral retina, the choroid, and the vitreous base. snowbanking is the hallmark feature. It is a grey-white fibrovascular plaque formed due to the coalescence of
snowball opacities over the pars plana. Pars planitis can be seen in multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, and syphilis.",,C,3102-1901.PNG;3103-1902.PNG
Q3,A diabetic patient presents to you with visual acuity of 6/9 in one eye. Further investigations revealed pre-retinal hemorrhages with neovascularization at the optic disc. what is the next  step in management?,"a)Focal laser photocoagulation
b)pan-retinal photocoagulation
c)Grid laser photocoagulation
d)scleral buckling","The clinical vignette is suggestive of proliferative diabetic retinopathy with high-risk
characteristics and the next step in management is pan-retinal photocoagulation.
Diabetic retinopathy is used to describe retinal changes seen in diabetic patients. It is classified into the following types:
• Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR)
• Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR)
• Diabetic maculopathy
• Advanced diabetic eye disease
Fundoscopy in NPDR reveals hard exudates, cotton-wool spots, and microaneurysms. Hard exudates are small, discrete yellowish, waxy areas with crenated margins.





Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is marked by NVD or NVE which is the hallmark of the
condition. condensation of connective tissue surrounding the newly formed vessels results in the   formation of a fibrovascular epiretinal membrane. Vitreous detachment and hemorrhage may also occur. Preretinal hemorrhages are considered a high-risk characteristic. In addition, changes seen  in NPDR may also be present.
The condition usually develops 25 years after the onset of the disease. Hence, it is more commonly seen in patients with type I diabetes.
The image below shows NVD.


PDR with high-risk characteristics is managed with pan-retinal photocoagulation. Laser treatment helps by inhibiting the release of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF). Anti-VEGFs are
recommended before pan-retinal photocoagulation in patients with PDR.
Diabetic maculopathy can be classified as:
• Focal exudative maculopathy: Microaneursysms, hard exudates, and hemorrhages can be seen.



• Diffuse exudative maculopathy: Diffuse retinal edema with few hard exudates.
• Ischemic maculopathy: Microaneursysms, hemorrhages, few hard exudates. Fluorescein angiography reveals areas of non-perfusion.
• Mixed maculopathy: Features of both exudative and ischemic maculopathy. An FFA image showing features of macular ischemia is given below.


other options:
option A: Focal laser photocoagulation is the treatment of choice for focal diabetic macular edema (DME) that does not involve the fovea.
option C: Grid laser photocoagulation can be used in diffuse DME not responding to anti-VEGFs and intravitreal steroids.
option D: scleral buckling can be used in cases of advanced PDR with tractional retinal
detachment.",,B,3056-1864.PNG;3104-1903.PNG;3105-1904.PNG
Q4,A 35-year-old woman is diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. what associated complication is shown in the image?,"a)scleromalacia perforans
b)ciliary staphyloma
c)coloboma
d)Malignant melanoma","scleromalacia perforans is the associated complication of rheumatoid arthritis that is shown in the image.
scleromalacia perforans is a specific type of necrotizing scleritis without inflammation,
characterized by progressive scleral thinning. The uveal tissue appears to shine through it.
spontaneous perforation is a rare complication of the condition. It is typically seen in elderly
women with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis. A yellowish patch of melting sclera can be seen. This is due to the obliteration of blood supply.
Clinical features include pain, photophobia, and lacrimation. The affected eye appears red.
Medical management includes steroids and immunosuppressants. In severe cases, surgical treatment by scleral patch graft may be done.



other options:
option B - ciliary staphyloma is used to describe the bulge of an area of weak sclera lined by the    ciliary body. common causes include scleritis, developmental glaucoma, and end-stage primary or secondary glaucoma. Thinning of the sclera, secondary to perforating injury, can also result in the condition.


option c - coloboma is a congenital anomaly, that develops due to a defect in the closure of the embryonic cleft. It is characterized by poorly developed uveal tissue. In some cases, it might be  deficient. The lens, choroid, and retina may also be involved.
The image below shows coloboma of the right eyelid.


option D - Malignant melanoma of the conjunctiva appears as a mass near the limbus. It can be   pigmented or non-pigmented. It is usually seen in elderly patients. The choroid, iris, ciliary body, and eyelids can also develop the tumor.
The image below shows malignant melanoma of the choroid.",3097-1895.PNG,A,3106-1906.PNG;3106-1905.PNG;3107-1907.PNG
Q5,what is the indication of this procedure?,"a)keratoconus
b)vogt's limbal girdle
c)keratoglobus
d)corneal dystrophy","The given image shows the placement of Intacs, which is done for keratoconus.
keratoconus or conical cornea is a non-inflammatory condition of the axial cornea. central or paracentral thinning of the cornea and apical protrusion of the anterior cornea are
pathognomonic. This is attributed to mucopolysaccharide and collagen tissue synthesis defects.


clinical features of the condition include defective vision, which develops due to progressive myopia and irregular astigmatism. Light sensitivity and ocular irritation may also be
present. complications include acute hydrops due to rupture of Descemet's membrane.
slit-lamp examination reveals Fleischer's ring at the base of the cone formed. Deep, vertical    stromal striae (vogt lines) that disappear on external pressure are characteristic. Retinoscopy



shows a yawning reflex.
The image below shows Munson's sign i.e. bulging of the lower lid on looking down.


The severity of the condition is graded based on keratometry. Corneal topography is a diagnostic modality with the highest sensitivity for early cases.
Intacs or intracorneal ring segments are useful in moderate cases, due to their flattening effect. Rigid gas permeable contact lenses, corneal collagen cross-linking with riboflavin, and
keratoplasty are the other treatment modalities.
other options:
option B - vogt's limbal girdle is a degenerative corneal disease that is more commonly seen in
women aged ≥4o years. A white crescentic limbal band can be seen at 9 and/or 3 'o'clock position, more frequently on the nasal side. In type I, a swiss-cheese hole pattern with a clear zone
separating it from the scleral margin can be observed. Type II is more common and lacks a clear zone and holes.
option C - keratoglobus is a familial disorder, marked by thinning and hemispherical protrusion   of the entire cornea. It can be congenital or acquired. Globular protrusion is seen here, in contrast to the conical ectasia seen in keratoconus. Intrastromal ring segments and cross-linking can be
used for management.





option D - Corneal dystrophy is used to describe a group of non-inflammatory conditions, with bilateral opacification of the cornea with no vascularisation. These are divided into epithelial,
Bowman layer, stromal, Descemet membrane, and endothelial dystrophies. Most conditions have genetic abnormalities.",3098-1897.PNG,A,3091-1891.PNG;3091-1890.PNG;3109-1908.PNG
Q6,A 3-year-old boy presents with mental retardation and an inability to walk. The funduscopy image is given below. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Tay-sachs disease
b)Hunter disease
c)Hurler syndrome
d)Gaucher disease","The given clinical scenario, along with the fundoscopy image showing a macular cherry-red spot, indicates the most likely diagnosis to be Tay-sachs disease.
Tay-sachs disease is a lysosomal storage disease caused by the deficiency of β-hexosaminidase. It can present during infancy with macrocephaly, increased startle reaction, gradual loss of motor    skills, and a macular cherry-red spot. Affected children usually die by the age of 1o–15 years.
It is of two types—juvenile-onset and adult-onset. The symptoms of the juvenile-onset form
include ataxia and dementia. Dysarthria, lower motor neuron signs, and psychiatric disorders are common in the adult-onset type.
other options:
options B - Hunter disease (mucopolysaccharidosis II) is an X-linked disorder that arises due to   the deficiency of iduronate 2-sulfatase. short stature, joint stiffness, and intellectual disability are the features.
option C - Hurler syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis I) is an autosomal recessive condition that affects multiple organs. presentation is usually at 6–24 months with corneal clouding, coarse
facial features, joint stiffness, and skeletal dysplasia. Glaucoma, retinal degeneration, and nasal discharge are the other features. The condition is generally fatal.
option D - Gaucher disease is a glycolipid storage disorder that can present with
hepatosplenomegaly, mental retardation, and erosion of long bones. It is caused by the deficiency of β-glucosidase. The Gaucher cell has a wrinkled-paper appearance due to intracytoplasmic
inclusions, which is a characteristic feature.",3098-1896.PNG,A,
