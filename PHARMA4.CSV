Question 1,All of the following are the uses of enteric-coated drugs except:,"a) protect the acid labile drug from gastric acidity
b) protect the gastric mucosa from irritant effects of certain drugs
c) prolongs the half life of the drug
d) Deliver drugs distal to stomach","Enteric coating of the drug does not prolong the half-life of the drug.
The half-life of a drug depends on the volume of distribution and rate of clearance from the blood. It is given by t1/2 = o.693x volume of distribution / clearance.
The enteric coating can be done for the following reasons:
• protection of active pharmaceutical ingredients, from the acidic environment of the stomach (e.g. enzymes and certain antibiotics).
• To prevent gastric distress or nausea from a drug due to irritation (e.g. sodium salicylate).
• For the delivery of drugs that are optimally absorbed in the small intestine to their primary absorption site in their most concentrated form.
• To provide a delayed-release component for repeat action.
• Required for minimizing the first-pass metabolism of the drug",,C,
Question 2,A patient who was on antiepileptics for the management of seizure disorder started having visual disturbance. Evaluation reveals the contraction of the visual field. The drug responsible is likely to be?,"a) phenobarbitone
b) vigabatrin
c) Ethosuximide
d) Levetiracetam",The given patient has developed a contraction of the visual field which is a side effect of vigabatrin.,,B,
Question 3,"If a patient who is on metoprolol is started on verapamil, which of the following side effects would be seen?","a) Bradycardia with Av block
b) Torsades de pointes
c) Tachycardia
d) ventricular fibrillation","The patient will be prone to developing bradycardia and AV block.
Both β-blockers and non-dihydropyridine calcium blockers have a propensity to slow down SA Node function and AV conduction. A combination of these drugs increases the risk further and is contraindicated. In contrast, propranolol has safely been used with the dihydropyridine group (nifedipine) of calcium channel blockers.",,A,
Question 4,The response on stimulation of muscarinic receptor is:,"a) Erection
b) Ejaculation
c) Bronchodilation
d) Increased myocardial contractility","Erection is mediated by muscarinic receptors.
Erection results from parasympathetic action which is mediated via muscarinic/nicotinic receptors, whereas sympathetic action is mediated by adrenergic receptors.",,A,
Question 5,Rosuvastatin should not be combined with which of the following drugs?,"a) oxycodon
b) clarithromycin
c) Adalimumab
d) Rivoraxaban","Rosuvastatin should not be combined with clarithromycin.
clarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic and it can cause drug interactions because of its ability to inhibit organic anion-transporting polypeptides 1B1 and 1B3 (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3) which are involved in the excretion of statins like rosuvastatin and pravastatin.
Individuals taking rosuvastatin, pravastatin, or fluvastatin with clarithromycin had an increased risk of hospitalization for acute kidney injury, an increased risk of hyperkalemia and an increased risk of all cause mortality.",,B,
Question 6,which is not a prodrug?,"a) proguanil
b) sulindac
c) primidone
d) Flurouracil","Among the given options primidone is not a prodrug.
Prodrugs are drugs that are in their pharmacologically inactive form. They are converted to their active forms by metabolism.
The prodrug may offer advantages over the active form in being more stable, having better bioavailability, or fewer side effects and toxicity. Some prodrugs are activated selectively at the site of action. The given options are examples of prodrugs:
• sulindac is a sulfoxide prodrug used in inflammatory diseases including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute gouty arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis.
• proguanil is a prodrug and its active metabolite is cycloguanil. It is used in the treatment and prevention of malaria.
• Fluro-uracil is a prodrug having the active metabolite as fluorouridine monophosphate",,C,
Question 7,which of the following topical antifungal has both anti-inflammatory effects and anti-pruritic action?,"a) ketoconazole
b) sertaconazole
c) Luliconazole
d) Terbinafine","sertaconazole has both anti-inflammatory effects and anti-pruritic action.

Question 9,"A psychiatric patient was started on lithium for the management of bipolar disorder. To monitor the blood lithium levels, at what time interval should the blood sample be collected after the administration of lithium tablets?","a) After 24 hours
b) After 12 hours
c) After 6 hours
d) Immediately after taking tablets","The blood sample for serum lithium estimation is to be collected after a time interval of 1o-12 hours from the previous dose of lithium.
Lithium is used in the management of bipolar disorder, mania, and has anti-suicidal properties. It has a narrow therapeutic index, and blood levels in excess of this may cause symptoms of toxicity. Therapeutic drug monitoring is done by measuring trough lithium levels 12 hours after the previous dose, at least 5 days after the initiation of the treatment with lithium.",,B,
Question 10,which of the following is a second line anti-tubercular drug?,"a) streptomycin
b) Ethionamide
c) Acyclovir
d) vancomycin","Ethionamide is a second line anti-tubercular drug.
Ethionamide is structurally related to isoniazid and acts by inhibiting the mycolic acid synthesis. It is effective against bacilli resistant to other drugs and has been proved effective in infections due to atypical mycobacteria. It is effective against both intracellular as well as extracellular organisms.
The first line anti-tubercular drugs include: Isoniazid, Rifampicin, pyrazinamide, Ethambutol The second line drugs include fluoroquinolones, ethionamide, capreomycin, kanamycin, amikacin, cycloserine, thioacetazone.
Note: This is a recall question when ethionamide is a second-line among the given options, and streptomycin was a first line injectable drug.",,B,
Question 11,which of the following anti-tubercular drug is not bactericidal?,"a) Isoniazid
b) Rifapentin
c) Thioacetazone
d) kanamycin","Thioacetazone is not a bactericidal drug, it is bacteriostatic.
Thioacetazone is never used alone. It is only used as a combination with first-line TB medications, such as isoniazid and rifampicin. It is used primarily to prevent the development of bacteria that are resistant to first-line drugs and to treat patients infected with drug-resistant TB.
It should never be used in HIV patients as it can cause severe and fatal skin reactions.
side-effects include gastrointestinal disturbances, blurring of vision, hemolytic anemia and urticaria.
Isoniazid is a first-line bactericidal drug that is active against both intracellular and extracellular bacilli.
Rifapentin is a rifampin congener having a similar mechanism of action. It is a bactericidal drug having a longer half-life than rifampin.
kanamycin is bactericidal and is active against bacilli resistant to streptomycin, INH, and cycloserine.",,C,
Question 12,which of the following drugs do not need dose adjustment in renal failure?,"a) sitagliptin
b) saxagliptin
c) Vildagliptin
d) Linagliptin","Linagliptin does not require dose adjustment in patients with renal failure.
Linagliptin is a dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. It is used in type 2 diabetes as monotherapy or in combination therapy when metformin is not tolerated or contraindicated.
It binds extensively to plasma proteins and is cleared primarily by the hepatobiliary system. Hence, no dosage adjustment is needed in renal failure.
other DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin) show renal elimination and therefore require dose reduction in renal failure.",,D,
Question 13,The antidote for fibrinolytic therapy is?,"a) urokinase
b) Dalteparin
c) Tranexamic acid
d) Alteptase","The antidote for fibrinolytic therapy is tranexamic acid.
Tranexamic acid is a lysine analogue that competitively bind to lysine binding sites on plasminogen and plasmin, and block their interactions with fibrin and thereby inhibiting fibrinolysis. It is given intravenously in trauma resuscitation, massive hemorrhage, and in women with postpartum hemorrhage.
other options:
option A (urokinase) and D (Alteplase) are fibrinolytic drugs.
option B: Dalteparin is low molecular weight heparin.",,C,IMAGE A;1052-742.PNG
Question 14,which of the following is least likely to be useful in a patient with severe coVID-19?,"a) Low molecular weight heparin
b) oxygen
c) Favipiravir
d) steroids","Favipiravir (inhibits viral RNA polymerase) was the first oral drug approved in India for restricted emergency use for the treatment of mild to moderate CoVID-19 patients. It was not approved for severe CoVID-19.
Note: This is a question from INICET 2020, during which time Favipiravir had gained approval from DCGI for mild to moderate CoVID. The current clinical management protocol for CoVID-19 does not recommend Favipiravir.",,C,
Question 15,"If codiene is coming to the market in combination with dextromethorphan as an anti-tussive, this combination _______","a) should not be used due to risk of addiction
b) can be used as both have different mechanism of action
c) should not be used as it is irrational
d) can be used to treat cough effectively","It is an irrational drug combination and should not be given.
Codeine is an opioid analgesic having specific antitussive action while dextromethorphan is a centrally active NMDA receptor antagonist that may be effective as an antitussive. Both are centrally acting antitussives, and do not provide any added advantage when combined. Hence it is an irrational drug combination.
Rational fixed-dose combination drugs for the treatment of cough usually contain:
• A centrally acting anti-tussive (either codeine or dextromethorphan; not both), with
• Antihistamines, decongestants and expectorants.
option A - Both of these drugs carry a risk of addiction, but it is not the reason to not give the drug. The main reason is that the combination is irrational.
options B & D - Both codeine and dextromethorphan have different mechanisms of action and can treat cough effectively. However, the combination of two centrally acting antitussives does not provide any added advantage compared to using one drug alone. Hence, the combination is irrational.",,C,
Question 16,The normality of 2M Hcl is ___ as 1M H2so4.,"a) Half
b) Twice
c) same
d) 4 times","The normality of 2M HCl is the same as 1M H2so4.
Normality of a solution can be calculated from its molarity by multiplying it by its valence.
Valence is the number of protons a salt releases in aqueous solution.
Here Valence of HCl is 1 while H2so4 is 2.
Hence Normality of HCl = 2M x 1 = 2 N
similarly Normality of H2so4 = 1M x 2 = 2N
Normality is defined as the number of gram equivalents dissolved per liter of solution. where gram equivalents are the number of moles of a solute multiplied by its valence
Molarity is defined as the number of moles of a solute dissolved per liter of solution.",,C,
Question 17,An elderly woman on treatment for migraine presents with chest pain. she has a previous history of angina/MI. which of the following mechanism of the prescribed drug for migraine might have caused this presentation?,"a) 5-HT antagonist
b) 5-HT agonist
c) calcium channel Blocker action
d) Nitric oxide mediated vasodilation","The patient may have been given sumatriptan, a 5-HT1b/1d receptor agonist which causes vasoconstriction and used in migraine. Thus, sumatriptan will worsen angina by causing coronary vasoconstriction.
Angina will be worsened if the o2 demand ofthe heart is increased or there is reduced blood flow to the already ischemic areas.",,B,
Question 18,A patient presented with pelvic fracture and head trauma after a road traffic accident. He was given IV morphine for pain relief following which he developed respiratory difficulty. what could be the most likely cause?,"a) pelvic Fracture
b) co2 retention due to opioid use
c) cerebral Edema
d) pulmonary embolism","The most likely cause of respiratory difficulty in the given clinical scenario is Co2 retention due to opioid use, as the patient was administered morphine after head trauma.
Head injury is considered as a contraindication to morphine use because:
• Morphine retains Co2 that increases intracranial pressure (ICP) and adds to the already increased ICP.
• Therapeutic doses can result in marked respiratory depression.
• Interferes with the assessment of progress by causing miosis, vomiting, and altered mentation.",,B,
Question 19,which of the following antidepressants causes the least sexual dysfunction?,"a) Fluoxetine
b) Venlafaxine
c) Mirtazapine
d) Imipramine","Among the given options mirtazapine causes the least sexual dysfunction.
Mirtazapine and mianserin block histamine H1 receptors and also have high antagonistic activity against 5HT2A, 5HT2C, and 5HT3 receptors. Sexual dysfunction is not a known side-effect of mirtazapine.
Due to its sedative effect, mirtazapine is used in depression with insomnia.
option A: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that can cause side effects like GI disturbances, sexual dysfunctions, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior, risk of serotonin syndrome with MAoIs, and some CyP interactions. vilazodone is an SSRI not associated with sexual dysfunction or weight gain.
option B: Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors like venlafaxine have side effects that include nausea and dizziness, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior, and can also cause sexual dysfunctions.
option D: Tricyclic antidepressants like imipramine have side effects like orthostatic hypotension, weight gain, GI disturbances, sexual dysfunction, seizures, and irregular heartbeats.
The various drugs classes used in depression and anxiety are listed below:
Class of drugs: Selective serotonin reuptake i nhibitors (SSRI); Serotonin-norepinephrine re uptake inhibitors; Tricyclic antidepressants; Atypical antipsychotics; Monoamine oxidase inhibitor s (MAo); Atypical antidperessants
Examples: Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine, Paroxetine, Sertraline, Citalopram; venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, Duloxetine, Milnacipran; Amitriptyline, Imipramine, Nor triptyline, Desipramine, Amoxapine; Aripiprazole, Olanzapine, Queti apine, Risperidone; Isocarboxazid, Selegiline, phene lzine; Bupropion, Trazodone, Mirtazapine, Mianserin",,C,
Question 20,which of the following statements is true about disulfiram?,"a) when used with alcohol, the patients feels drowsy, with chest discomfort and respiratory depression
b) It is an anticraving drug
c) It can be initiated even in minimally motivated person
d) Its action persists up to 2-3 days after stopping the drug","Disulfiram is used in behavioural modification technique for alcohol de-addiction. The principle of action is aversive conditioning.
Disulfiram is an irreversible inhibitor of both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of aldehyde dehydrogenase. Ethanol consumption during disulfiram therapy can lead to increased concentrations of acetaldehyde. Increased acetaldehyde levels can cause flushing, pulsating headache, throbbing pain in head and neck, nausea, vomiting, rashes, respiratory difficulties, chest pain, autonomic manifestations and other aversive reactions.
Disulfiram can only be given to highly motivated individuals. Disulfiram should not be administered until the person has abstained from alcohol for at least 12 hours. The disulfiram-alcohol reaction may occur as long as 14 days after the last dose of disulfiram.
Disulfiram like reaction with alcohol ingestion is also seen with the following drugs:
• Metronidazole
• Sulfonylureas like chlorpropamide
• cephalosporins like cefoperazone, cefamandole
other modalities of treatment:
• pharmacotherapy: Typically 5-1o days, treatment for detoxification: Benzodiazepine and chlordiazepoxide are the drugs of choice.
• Rehabilitation programs: Typically 28-day programs, learn about relapse prevention and identification of triggers.
• Maintenance phase: Baclofen, Acamprosate, Naltrexone, Topiramate, SSRI, ondansetron
• psychotherapy: Group therapy such as Alcoholics Anonymous",,D,
Question 21,which of the following drugs promotes bone formation?,"a) calcitonin
b) Raloxifene
c) Bisphosphonates
d) Teriparatide","Teriparatide increases bone formation especially when given in low doses and intermittently.
Teriparatide is a recombinant preparation of parathyroid hormone.
The pharmacologic activity of teriparatide, which is similar to the physiologic activity of PTH, includes stimulating osteoblast function, increasing gastrointestinal calcium absorption, and increasing renal tubular reabsorption of calcium.
Although it may be more effective than bisphosphonates and estrogen, it has to be administered subcutaneously every day. Hence it is indicated mostly in severe osteoporosis.
Teriparatide increases the risk of osteosarcoma and it is contraindicated in conditions that cause high risk of osteosarcoma such as:
• Paget disease
• Prior h/o of radiotherapy
• young adults with open epiphysis
• unexplained elevated ALP
• Hypercalcemia
option A: Calcitonin decreases bone resorption.
option B: Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator, which decreases bone resorption. It is used to prevent and treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.
option C: Bisphosphonates like alendronate and etidronate decrease bone resorption.",,D,
Question 22,A known asthmatic patient with fever and sore throat was prescribed an antibiotic. Two days later he presents with a maculopapular rash. which of the following drugs might have caused this?,"a) prednisolone
b) salbutamol
c) Fexofenadine
d) Amoxicillin","skin rashes of all types may be caused by allergy to penicillin.
Amoxicillin and ampicillin are aminopenicillins. The incidence of skin rashes appears to be highest following the use of ampicillin, at about 9%.
Amoxicillin is a close congener of ampicillin with the following features:
• Better oral absorption; food does not interfere with the absorption
• Incidence of diarrhea is less
• More active against penicillin-resistant pneumococci",,D,
Question 23,what is the most common drawback of the given device?,"a) Bacterial contamination
b) Does not provide multiple doses
c) Drug deposition in the oropharynx
d) Not portable","The given image shows a metered-dose inhaler (MDI). The most common side effect of this device is drug deposition in the oropharynx.
Most material inhaled using this device will be swallowed and absorbed, entering systemic circulation after undergoing the first-pass effect in the liver. some drug will also be absorbed into the systemic circulation from the lungs.
The use of a large-volume spacer will reduce the amount of drug deposited in the oropharynx, thereby reducing the amount swallowed and absorbed from the GI tract, thus limiting the systemic effects of the drug.
The given image shows the use of spacer with MDI:
spacers reduce the velocity and size of particles entering the upper airways. This reduces the amount of drug that impinges on the oropharynx and increases the proportion of the drug inhaled into the lower airways.
spacer devices are useful in delivering inhaled drugs to small children, as young as 3 years of age, who are not able to use a pMDI (pressurized MDI), as seen in the image below:
Pressurized metered-dose inhalers: Drugs are propelled from a canister in the pMDI with the aid of a propellant. These devices are convenient, portable, and typically deliver 5o–2oo doses of the drug.
Dry powder inhalers: Drugs may also be delivered as a dry powder using devices that scatter a fine powder dispersed by air turbulence on inhalation. children less than 7 years of age find it difficult to use a DPI. DPIs have been developed to deliver peptides and proteins, such as insulin, systemically but have proved to be problematic because of the consistency of dosing. The given image shows various types of dry powder inhalers:
Nebulizers: Two types of nebulizers are available. Jet nebulizers are driven by a stream of gas (air or oxygen), whereas ultrasonic nebulizers use a rapidly vibrating piezoelectric crystal and thus do not require a source of compressed gas.
The nebulized drug may be inspired during tidal breathing, and it is possible to deliver much higher doses of the drug as compared to pMDI. Nebulizers are therefore useful in treating acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD, for delivering drugs when airway obstruction is extreme (e.g., in severe COPD), for delivering inhaled drugs to infants and small children who cannot use the other inhalation devices, and for giving drugs such as antibiotics when relatively high doses must be delivered.",,C,"IMAGE Q,IMAGE A,IMAGE B;1057-744.PNG;1057-743.PNG;1058-746.PNG;1058-745.PNG"
Question 24,which of the following statements is correct for a patient on high dose of penicillin and gentamicin?,"a) TDM is done with penicillin because of narrow therapeutic index
b) TDM is done with gentamicin because of narrow therapeutic index
c) TDM is done with both because of dangerous side effects
d) Both drugs do not need monitoring","Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that requires therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) as it has a narrow therapeutic index. It is nephrotoxic and ototoxic (predominantly vestibular effects). The threshold for toxicity for gentamicin is the plasma concentration of 2 μg/mL, the maximum recommended for prolonged exposure.
Aminoglycoside antibiotics act by binding to the 3os ribosome and inhibiting protein synthesis. Their ability to cause misreading of DNA templates and the formation of aberrant proteins that get incorporated into bacterial cell membranes makes them bactericidal agents.
common ototoxic drugs are:
• Antibiotics - aminoglycosides (gentamicin > tobramycin > amikacin > neomycin), erythromycin, tetracyclines.
• chemotherapeutic agents - cisplatin, bleomycin, nitrogen mustards.
• High dose aspirin, acetaminophen, NsAID’s
• Antimalarials - quinine, quinidine
• phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors - sildenafil",,B,
Question 25,"A boy presents with pallor and lymphadenopathy, the X-ray of his skull is given below. which of the following drug is not used for the management of the suspected diagnosis?","a) Cyclosporine
b) Methotrexate
c) vinblastine
d) vincristine","The given clinical scenario and the X-ray of the skull are suggestive of Langerhans cell Histiocytosis. vincristine is not used in the management of this condition.
Following are skeletal and radiological manifestations of Langerhan's cell histiocytosis:
skull:
• solitary or multiple punched-out lytic lesion without sclerotic rim.
• Double contour or beveled edge appearance ( hole within a hole sign).
• Button sequestra representing residual bone.
• Geographic skull.
Mandible:
• Floating tooth: loss of lamina dura.

Question 26,A patient was treated with TCA for a major depressive episode in the hospital for 4 weeks. what is the main concern while considering his discharge from the hospital?,"a) Need for drug monitoring
b) ECG monitoring for arrhythmias
c) suicidal risk
d) sedation being the side effect","suicidal thoughts or behavior are a side effect of TCAs. Therefore, the attendants of the patient should be warned regarding this when a patient gets discharged after being treated with TCAs for a major depressive episode.
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are drugs that act by inhibiting the reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin from the synaptic clefts.
The side effects of TCAs are due to blockade of other receptors:
• Muscarinic M receptors- constipation, dry mouth, arrhythmia
• Histamine H1 receptors- sedation
• 5HT receptors - weight gain due to increased appetite
• Alpha1 receptors - postural hypotension.
The various classes of drugs used in depression and anxiety are listed below:
Class of drugs: selective serotonin reuptake i nhibitors (ssRI); serotonin-norepinephrine re uptake inhibitors; Tricyclic antidepressants; Atypical antipsychotics; Monoamine oxidase inhibitor s (MAO); Atypical antidepressants
Examples: Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram; venlafaxine, Desvenlafaxine, Duloxetine, Milnacipran; Amitriptyline, Imipramine, Nor triptyline, Desipramine, Amoxapine; Aripiprazole, Olanzapine, Quetiapine, Risperidone; Isocarboxazid, selegiline, phenelzine; Bupropion, Trazodone, Mirtazapine, Mianserin",,C,
Question 27,which of the following drugs exacerbates myasthenia and is usually avoided in a patient with myasthenia gravis? 1. Lidocaine 2. Digene 3. Meropenem 4. phenytoin,"a) 1 and 2
b) 2 and 3
c) 1 and 3
d) 1 only","Lidocaine can exacerbate myasthenia gravis and should be avoided in patients with this disease. Also, digene is an antacid, that contains magnesium hydroxide as one of its active ingredients, which may exacerbate myasthenia.
Drugs that may aggravate myasthenia gravis are
• Antibiotics like aminoglycosides, quinolones, and macrolides
• Beta-blockers
• Botulinum toxin
• Local anaesthetics
• Magnesium
• Non–depolarising muscle relaxants
• penicillamine
• Quinine derivatives
Aminoglycosides have to be avoided in a patient with myasthenia gravis. It blocks ca2+ mediated exocytosis of acetylcholine from the presynaptic membrane in the neuromuscular junction. The decrease in Ach levels aggravates myasthenia gravis. Aminoglycosides can also have a direct inhibitory effect on post-synaptic acetylcholine receptors.",,A,IMAGE A;1062-749.PNG
Question 28,which of the following drugs are used for absence seizures? A. Carbamazepine B. Valproate C. Ethosuximide D. Gabapentin,"a) A, B and C
b) B and C only
c) B only
d) A, B and D","Ethosuximide and valproate are effective for the treatment of absence seizures. However, between these 2 drugs, Ethosuximide would be a better first-line treatment choice for uncomplicated typical absence seizures followed by valproate. Atypical absence seizures respond well to valproate.
Typical absence seizures are characterized by sudden, brief lapses of consciousness without loss of postural control. There is no postictal confusion. The following subtle motor signs may accompany the episodes
• Rapid blinking of the eyelids
• chewing movements
• small-amplitude clonic movements of the hands
Hyperventilation has a tendency to provoke the absence seizures.
NOTE: In a typical absence seizure, Ethosuximide is the first-line therapy for it and acts by blocking the calcium channel.
Mechanism of action of some common antiepileptics:
Mechanism of action: sodium-channel blockers; calcium-channel blockers; GABAAreceptor modulators; GABA uptake inhibitors; NMDA receptor antagonist; AMpA/kainate receptor anta gonist; HCN channel activity enhanc ers; Inhibitors of brain carbonic a nhydrase; potassium-channel openers
Antiepileptics: phenytoincarbamazepine, Oxcarbamazepine, Eslicarbazepine, Lamotrigine, Topiramate, Felbamate, valproate, Rufinamide, Levetiracetam; valproate, Lamotrigine, Ethosuximide; Benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, Felbamate, primidone, Topiramate, Carbamazepine, Oxcarbamazepine, stiripentol, Clobazam; Tiagabine, Vigabatrin; Felbamate; phenobarbital, Topiramate, perampanel; Lamotrigine; Acetazolamide, zonisamide, Topiramate; Retigabine, Topiramate",,B,
Question 29,Match the following dilution of adrenaline and its use: A. 1:1ooo B. 1:1oooo C. 1:1ooooo 1. Cardiac arrest 2. Anaphylaxis 3. Local anesthesia,"a) A-1 B-2 C-3
b) A-2 B-1 C-3
c) A-3 B-2 C-1
d) A-1 B-3 C-2","A-2 B-1 C-3
Epinephrine (1:1ooo solution) o.5 ml I.M. is preferred in the treatment of anaphylactic shock.
In cardiac arrest, the 1:1ooo adrenaline must be diluted to 1:1o,ooo for IV use.
Adrenaline in a concentration of 1: 5o,ooo to 1: 2oo,ooo is added to local anesthetics for:
• Reducing the systemic absorption
• prolonging the duration of action
• providing a more bloodless field for surgery
1:1ooo dilution can be used for intramuscular, subcutaneous and inhalational (nebulization) route of administration. For intravenous use, 1:1ooo adrenaline must be further diluted to 1:1o,ooo and used cautiously.
IM injection is preferred over intravenous (IV) bolus because it is faster in many situations and safer (ie, lower risk of cardiovascular complications, such as severe hypertension and ventricular arrhythmias). There is a much greater risk of causing harmful side effects by inappropriate dosage or misdiagnosis of anaphylaxis when using IV adrenaline.
Epinephrine is also used in the treatment of hypotension, to induce local vasoconstriction to reduce the diffusion of local anaesthetics, to induce bronchodilation in asthma and COpD.
Note: . The recommended dose of epinephrine is 1mg 〓 1o mL of a 1:1o,ooo solution administered IV every 3 to 5 minutes during resuscitation as per the CpR guidelines. For nebulization, 1:1ooo adrenaline is commonly used.",,B,

d) A-4, B-1, C-2, D-3","A-2, B-1, C-4, D-3
Vancomycin is Drug of Choice for Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (should be used only if other drugs are resistant ).
Metronidazole is the drug of choice for anaerobic infections caused by Bacteroides.
uses of metronidazole include:
• Giardiasis
• Trichomoniasis
• Amoebiasis
• Bacterial vaginosis
• treatment of pseudomembranous colitis.
Meropenem is used in infections caused by ESBL producing bacteria like klebsiella.
Carbapenems are not hydrolyzed by ESBL (extended-spectrum beta-lactamases). Therefore, carbapenems like imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem are resistant to hydrolysis by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and are indicated in the treatment of infections caused by ESBL producing bacteria. ESBL is most prevalent among gram-negative organisms like klebsiella and E. coli.
penicillins like amoxicillin, ampicillin can be used in H. influenzae infections.",,B,IMAGE Q
Question 31,which of the following drug reduces mortality in COVID-19 patients? A. Dexamethasone B. Remdesivir C. Favipravir,"a) B and C
b) A and B
c) Only A
d) A, B , C","Among the given options, only dexamethasone is shown to reduce mortality in severe covid19 cases.
patients with severe CoVID-19 can develop a systemic inflammatory response that can lead to lung injury and multisystem organ dysfunction. It has been proposed that the potent anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids might prevent or mitigate these deleterious effects and help reduce mortality.
In severe cases, Dexamethasone is administered at doses of 6mg IV/po once daily for 1o days or until hospital discharge. If dexamethasone is not available, then, equivalent doses of other corticosteroids, like prednisone, methylprednisone, or hydrocortisone may be used.
