Q1,A patient presented with dysuria and pain in the back. His lumbar spine X-ray shows the below finding. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)wilson's disease
b)Addison's disease
c)cystic fibrosis
d)Hyperparathyroidism","The given clinical scenario and X-ray showing diffuse calcification of both kidneys are suggestive of nephrocalcinosis which is seen in hyperparathyroidism.
Nephrocalcinosis is the deposition of calcium in the kidney parenchyma or tubules which is seen in conditions causing hypercalcemia like hyperparathyroidism.
Clinical features of hyperparathyroidism:
• Bones:
• Pathological fractures
• subperiosteal bone resorption - 2nd and 3rd digits, most common in the radial aspect
• salt and pepper skull
• osteitis fibrosa cystica or vonReckling Hausen’s disease of bone
• stones
• Multiple and recurrent renal stones - most common
• Nephrocalcinosis
• Abdominal groans - colicky due to pancreatitis
• Psychiatric overtones - raised PTH causing CNs depression and psychiatric symptoms
• Band keratopathy
• Features of hypercalcemia -
• vomiting
• Confusion
• ECG changes: increased PR interval, shortened QT interval
Investigations done in primary hyperparathyroidism:
• ultrasonography of the neck is a safe and widely used technique for the localization of abnormal parathyroid glands.
• Nuclear medicine scanning with radiolabeled sestamibi is also a widely used technique.
sestamibi accumulates in parathyroid adenomas. This radionuclide is concentrated in the thyroid and parathyroid tissue but usually washes out of normal thyroid tissue in under an hour. It
persists in abnormal parathyroid tissue.
• Dual-energy radiographic absorptiometry is a useful tool to demonstrate skeletal involvement in primary hyperparathyroidism.",4020-2580.PNG,D,
Q2,Identify the finding in the given ultrasound image.,"a)Mercedes-Benz sign
b)Gall bladder polyp
c)Gall bladder cancer
d)phrygian cap","The ultrasound examination of the gallbladder shows a phrygian cap. It is a normal anatomical variant.
phrygian cap refers to an anatomical variant of the gallbladder, where, the fundus of the
gallbladder folds on itself, or is separated from the body by a partial or complete septum. A true  septum is uncommon and is usually an apparent septum due to the gallbladder wall folding. It is an incidental finding that may be seen on CT, MRI, or ultrasound. It causes no symptoms.
The phrygian cap is named so, due to the resemblance of the ultrasonographic appearance to a hat or cap that is worn by the inhabitants of ancient phrygia circa 12oo BC.",4021-2581.PNG,D,4026-2586.PNG;4026-2585.PNG
Q3,Banana sign on USG is associated with which of the following conditions?,"a)Spina bifida
b)omphalocele
c)Downs syndrome
d)klinefelter syndrome","The banana sign on USG is seen in spina bifida.
Banana sign is an abnormal anterior curvature of the cerebellum along with effacement of the cisterna magna that produces this appearance. It is seen in spina bifida and is also associated  with Arnold-chiari malformation.
Spina bifida is a congenital anomaly occurring due to incomplete development of the neural tube. The most commonly cited signs present in spina bifida are the banana sign and the lemon sign.


The lemon sign occurs due to the overlapping of the frontal bones due to the posterior shift of intracranial contents as shown below.


other options:
option B: omphalocele is a congenital midline anterior abdominal wall defect through which the solid abdominal viscera or bowel herniates. The herniated abdominal contents are covered by a



membranous sac as shown below.


The image below shows an ultrasound image of the fetus suggestive of an omphalocele (asterisk).


option C: Nuchal translucency (NT) is used to antenatally screen Downs syndrome (Trisomy 21)  during the first trimester. NT is the maximum thickness of the translucent area between the skin and soft tissue over the fetal spine at the back of the neck. when the NT measurement is
increased, it is a marker for fetal aneuploidy and structural anomalies. The ultrasound image
below shows increased NT thickness and absent nasal bone of a fetus with Trisomy 21 at 11 weeks gestation.",,A,4027-2588.PNG;4027-2587.PNG;4028-2590.PNG;4028-2589.PNG;4029-2592.PNG
Q4,Identify the fracture site in the X-ray shown below.,"a)5th, 6th rib
b)5th, 6th &amp; 7the rib
c)7th and 8th rib
d)6th and 7th rib","The given X-ray shows the fracture of the 6th and 7th rib
In the chest X-ray, ribs appear as light grey strips. The anterior part of the rib is more oblique and the medial part cannot be demonstrable as it ends with costal cartilage. The posterior part of the    rib is more horizontal and the attachment of the rib with the vertebra can be easily made out.

The anterior(yellow) and posterior(red) ribs are highlighted in the image given below.",4022-2582.PNG,D,4029-2591.PNG;4030-2593.PNG
Q5,which of the following is not an advantage of USG over Mammography?,"a)can be used for screening mammographically undetectable clinically non palpable breast mass
b)Useful in young females with dense breast
c)Differentiates between solid and cystic lesions in the Breast
d)Guided biopsy can be done","USG cannot be used for screening mammographically undetectable clinically nonpalpable breast mass. Although ultrasound has its advantages in certain scenarios, mammography remains the    primary screening tool for breast tumor detection.
Mammography is complementary to physical examination and can detect clinically non-palpable breast mass. The primary purpose of mammography is to detect small breast tumors. while
mammography is typically the initial screening tool for breast cancer detection, there are specific scenarios where ultrasound may be preferred or used in conjunction with mammography.
Advantages of USG over mammography include:
• USG is preferred in pregnant women, lactating women, and young women since breast tissue is dense (option B) in these populations.
• USG can differentiate between solid and cystic lesions (option C) of the breast and is able to detect abnormal axillary lymph nodes.
• Ultrasound can assist in guided breast biopsy (option D) procedures.",,A,
Q6,An MRcP image is shown below. which among the following is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Choledocholithiasis
b)Cholecystitis
c)Pancreatic duct stricture
d)Malignancy","The given MRCP image shows multiple round filling defects within the common bile duct indicative of choledocholithiasis.
Choledocholithiasis or common bile duct stones are classified based on their point of origin.
Choledocholithiasis is mostly clinically silent but may present with biliary colic and even
obstructive jaundice. Management of choledocholithiasis includes ERCP +/- sphincterotomy followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy.



MRCp uses the fluid which is present in the biliary and pancreatic ducts as a contrast agent and does not require external contrast material administered into the ductal system. It is
a non-invasive investigation for evaluating extrahepatic, intrahepatic bile duct, and pancreatic duct. No interventions are performed under MRCp.
MRCp uses T2 weighted  MRI and it recognizes slow-flowing or stationary fluid within ducts,  which appear brighter relative to adjacent solid tissues. MRCp can be used to evaluate various conditions of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system, examples include:
• Congenital anomalies of the cystic and hepatic ducts
• post-surgical biliary anatomy
• pancreas divisum
• Anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction
• Choledocholithiasis
• Biliary structures
• Chronic pancreatitis
• pancreatic cystic lesions
• Trauma to the biliary system
MRCp in benign strictures would typically show smooth elongated tapering of the bile duct, while malignancy-associated strictures typically show abrupt shouldering.",4023-2584.PNG,A,
Q7,The image given below shows the MRI of the knee. Identify the marked structure.,"a)ACL
b)PCL
c)McL
d)patellar tendon","In the above given image of an MRI of the knee joint, the arrow shows the posterior cruciate ligament.
The posterior cruciate ligament (pCL) is the only primary restraint to posterior
translation throughout the entire knee range of motion. It prevents the internal rotation of the tibia on the femur when there is varus stress on the knee.
It acts as a secondary restraint to valgus/varus, external rotation.

Q8,"A child was brought to the emergency with drooling and choking following ingestion of a
foreign body. Based on the given X-ray, what object was most likely swallowed by the child?","a)cap of a cool drink bottle
b)coin
c)Button battery
d)Metal ball","The presence of a halo sign or double ring sign is indicative of the foreign body being a button  battery. Furthermore, the presence of irregularities along the periphery of the battery indicates the possibility of corrosion.
Button batteries and sharp objects in the oesophagus and foreign bodies associated with respiratory symptoms all mandate urgent endoscopic removal.
Button batteries, in particular, are very dangerous foreign bodies, which must be expediently removed because they can cause:
• Mucosal injury in 1-hour contact time
• Involve all layers of the oesophagus in 4 hours
Injury is thought to be secondary to electrochemical burns from electrical discharge. chemical
burns from electrolyte alkali leakage and pressure necrosis also may contribute to mucosal injury.
Asymptomatic blunt objects and coins lodged in the oesophagus can be observed for up to 24 hr in anticipation of passage into the stomach.
Another AP and lateral X-ray demonstrating the presence of a button battery in the oesophagus is as shown below.",4023-2583-1.png,C,4033-2595.PNG
