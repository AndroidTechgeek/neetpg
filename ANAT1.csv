ANA3,"Among the following, what is the function of the marked muscles?","a) Depression
b) protrusion

c) Elevation
d) Retraction","The muscle marked in the above image is the lateral pterygoid muscle and its primary function is depression of the mandible (opening of the mouth).
Bilateral contraction of the lateral pterygoid alone causes depression of the mandible (making it   the primary function) whereas, protrusion is the result of bilateral contraction of both the medial and lateral pterygoid muscles.
The lateral pterygoid has the following actions:
• opening of the jaw (depression): Lateral pterygoid has a specialized role in mandibular
opening mediated by its horizontal fibres. when left and right lateral pterygoid muscles contract together, the mandibular condyle is pulled forwards and slightly downwards. This protrusive
movement alone has little or no function except in assisting the opening of the jaw (Gray's Anatomy 41st edition).
• side-to-side movement: when the lateral pterygoid contracts unilaterally along with the adjacent medial pterygoid the jaw is pulled medially. This is used for grinding food between teeth of the
same side. This action is mediated by the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid.

a) Abducens nerve
b) spinal accessory nerve
c) ophthalmic artery
d) Middle meningeal artery","The marked foramen is the superior orbital fissure and the abducens nerve passes through it.

The sympathetic trunks on either side of the vertebral columns consist of a series of ganglia. They are connected to the spinal nerves by white and grey rami communicantes. The cell bodies of the   preganglionic sympathetic neurons are located in the lateral horn in the spinal grey matter. They   leave the cord in the ventral nerve roots to form spinal nerves.

The axons of the postganglionic neurons return to the spinal nerve
through the grey rami communicantes.

ANA18,what represents the marked area in the given histology of lymph node?,"a) Marginal zone
b) paracortical zone
c) Germinal center
d) Mantle zone","The area marked in the image is the mantle zone of a lymph node.

Lymph node has primary follicle composed of small, quiescent lymphocytes, and a secondary follicle with germinal centre composed mainly of antigen-stimulated B cells.
The mantle zone is produced as surrounding cells are marginalised by the rapidly growing
germinal centre. It is populated by mainly quiescent B cells with condensed heterochromatic nuclei and little cytoplasm (hence the deeply basophilic staining of this region in routine
preparations), a few helper T cells, Follicular Dendritic cells and macrophages.
In peripheral lymph nodes, the marginal zone are often inapparent because they are mixed with the mantle zone cells. And often not well developed in lymph nodes.
The paracortex lies between the cortical follicles and the medulla and is populated mainly by T cells, which are not organised into follicles",25-13.PNG,D,40-30.PNG
ANA19,"A young patient presented with hypoparathyroidism, absent thymus and tetany. which of the following marked areas in the picture is defective in this condition?","a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4","The given clinical scenario of hypoparathyroidism, absent thymus, and tetany is suggestive of
DiGeorge syndrome. It is caused by defective development of the third and fourth pharyngeal
pouch. In the image of pharyngeal pouches, ""3"" points to the thymus (derivative of 3rd pharyngeal pouch). since in the above question, the thymus is absent, option 3 will be the most appropriate     answer. DiGeorge syndrome is a complex embryopathy that is caused by the hemizygous interstitial  deletion of chromosome 22. It is characterized by multiple developmental defects, including conotruncal defects, hypoparathyroidism, and dysmorphic syndrome. It is also known as
velocardiofacial syndrome (palate, facial, and cardiac defects).
It has variable presentations including cleft palate, Abnormal facies, Thymic aplasia leading to T-cell deficiency, cardiac defects, and Hypocalcemia secondary to parathyroid
aplasia (cATcH-22)

Tests for ulnar nerve lesions are as follows:
• card test positive

• palmaris brevis sign
positive card test is due to weakness of palmar interrosei, causing loss of adduction. As a result, the patient is unable to hold the card firmly between his or her fingers.



option A: It is the radial groove where radial nerve runs along with profunda brachii artery.
option D: It is the neck of humerus where axillary nerve runs around.
option B: It is the lateral epicondyle. Fracture of this part may lead to tardy ulnar nerve palsy, but incidence is less.",26-14,C,42-33.PNG
