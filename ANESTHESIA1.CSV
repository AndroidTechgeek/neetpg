Q1,"A 4o year old female with burns over her abdomen, both limbs and back and presented after 8 hours. which of the following is the formula for calculation of fluid infusion?","a)2 ml/kg X %TBSA for the next 16 hours
b)5 ml/kg X %TSBA for the next 16 hours
c)4 ml/kg X %TSBA for first 8 hours then 2 ml/kg X %TBSA for next 16 hours
d)4 ml/kg X%TSBA for the next 16 hours","A drastic fall in etco2 with hypotension during neck surgery is most likely due to venous air embolism (VAE).
In modified radical neck dissection (MRND), a head-up position is given to provide a bloodless   surgical field. VAE into severed vessels is likely to occur when the surgical site is above the right atrium and venous pressure at the incision site is below the atmospheric pressure. pulmonary     artery pressure will rise and etco2 will fall after a venous air embolism.
In sympathetic overactivity and carotid body stimulation, blood pressure will rise.
In vagal stimulation, a drastic drop in etco2 is unlikely.",,A,3409-2137.PNG
Q2,"A 35-year-old woman was brought to the casualty ward with a history of road traffic accident (RTA) and head trauma. Her eye opens to pain, moans, can localize limb towards the pain      stimulus on the left hand and away from the pain stimulus on the right hand and both the
legs in extended posture. Calculate her GCS.","a)11
b)9
c)7
d)3","The distal termination of the spinal cord is the lower border of L1 in adults.
Because the spinal cord ends at L1, lower nerve roots course some distance before exiting the intervertebral foramina. These lower spinal nerves form the cauda equina.
Note:
In children, the spinal cord ends at L3 and moves up with age.",,B,
Q3,A patient who was on ventilator and being ventilated for past few days suddenly pulls out of the endotracheal tube. what is the next step of management?,"a)Re intubate
b)oxygenate and reintubate
c)Start CPR
d)watch for spontaneous breaths and reintubate if needed","Acute myocardial infarction is not a contraindication for morphine use.
Morphine is the opioid of choice for myocardial infarction as it relieves anxiety, chest pain, and myocardial oxygen demand.
contraindications to the use of Morphine:
• Bronchial asthma: Histamine release can cause bronchoconstriction and precipitate attacks of asthma.
• Renal failure: Morphine-6-glucuronide (metabolite) can accumulate and lead to prolonged respiratory depression.
• Emphysema: Respiratory depression and decreased response to hypoxia can cause hypercapnia in patients with coPD
• Head injury: Hypercapnia due to respiratory depression can increase IcP. Miosis, vomiting, and effect on wakefulness make interpreting the signs of head injury difficult.
• Biliary colic: constriction of sphincter of oddi can worsen biliary spasm
• Hypotension and shock",,D,
Q4,The time required for preoxygenation before tracheal intubation?,"a)1 min
b)3 min
c)5-7 min
d)5 min","capnography is a measurement of end-tidal co2, which is used to confirm tracheal intubation and assess ventilation in the perioperative period.
cardiac output measurements technique:
• Thermodilution
• Dye dilution, using indocyanine green
• Lithium dilution
• Pulse contour devices
• Esophageal doppler
• Thoracic bioimpedance
• Echocardiography
Note: Thermal dilution method uses a non-toxic liquid of temperature different from the blood. This fluid is injected into a vein and is detected on the arterial side using a catheter with a
temperature sensor. The rate of flow of this liquid is used to calculate the cardiac output.",,B,
Q5,Nerve fibre least susceptible to local anesthetic is:,"a)A-delta
b)A- gamma
c)A- beta
d)C","The nerve fibre least susceptible to local anaesthetic is type C. The order of susceptibility of nerve fibres to local anaesthetics is B &gt;A-δ &gt; A-γ &gt; A-β &gt; A-α &gt; C i.e
• B fibres are the most susceptible/least resistant
• C fibres are the least susceptible/most resistant



Factors that increase the sensitivity of nerve fibres are :
• smaller diameter
• unmyelinated nerves
• Anatomical and physiological factors
*Note: Although theoretically, C fibres are supposed to be the most susceptible to local anaesthetics, practically it was found to be the least susceptible.",,D,
Q6,which of the following can be used as an intravenous induction agent?,"a)Lorazepam
b)Bupivacaine
c)Dexmedetomidine
d)Neostigmine","Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be used for induction of anesthesia at a dose of o.1mg/kg, although midazolam is preferred among benzodiazepines.
Benzodiazepines are mainly used for sedation and less commonly for induction of anesthesia due to the availability of better induction agents (propofol, etomidate, ketamine, and thiopentone).
Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 agonist and is used primarily as an adjuvant. so, a better option would be lorazepam.",,A,
Q7,which of the following is the correct sequence?,"a)Assess the patient’s response, Activate ERS, check carotid pulse, Start CPR
b)Check carotid pulse, Start CPR, Call for help and activate ERS, Defibrillate
c)Defibrillate, Assess response, Check carotid pulse, Maintain airway
d)Start CPR, Activate ERS, Defibrillate, Check pulse","BLs sequence:
First step – Assess safety of the surroundings.
second step - Assess for responsiveness
Third step – proceed if the patient is unresponsive. shout for help.
If the patient is unresponsive assess for breathing and carotid pulse simultaneously for no more than 1o seconds.
