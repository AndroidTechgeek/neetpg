Q1,"A 56-year-old■ female patient presented with progressive dysphagia for solids, loss of weight, and loss of appetite. A barium swallow done is given below. what is the most probable
diagnosis?","a)carcinoma esophagus
b)Diffuse esophageal spasm
c)Esophageal leiomyoma
d)Esophageal web","A patient with the given history and barium swallow findings of irregular narrowing, mucosal destruction, and shouldered margins of esophagus, are suggestive of carcinoma esophagus.
Esophageal carcinoma is more common in men, with tobacco use and alcohol being the strongest risk factors. The squamous cell carcinoma variant usually affects the upper 2/3rd, and the
adenocarcinoma variant usually affects the lower 1/3rd of the esophagus. clinical features include progressive dysphagia (most common), regurgitation of food, vomiting, odynophagia and weight   loss.
on barium swallow, carcinoma esophagus presents with irregular narrowing and ulceration of esophagus. Flexible endoscopy with biopsy is preferred for confirmation of
diagnosis. contrast-enhanced cT and PET can be used to assess distant metastasis. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the investigation of choice to assess tumor invasion and lymph node   metastasis.
other options:
option B:  Diffuse esophageal spasm results in the corkscrew appearance of the esophagus on barium study.



option C: Esophageal leiomyoma appears as a smooth, semilunar filling defect on barium swallow. it is seen as a discrete ovoid mass that is well outlined by barium.
option D: Esophageal webs occur in the upper and middle esophagus as a thin membrane that can be identified by the translucent part on contrast radiology.",3935-2490.PNG,A,
Q2,"A 3o-year-old woman presents with persistent hypertension, chest pain and cramping in her  legs, particularly during exertion. A chest radiograph was taken, which reveals the condition, as shown in the image below. what is the likely■ underlying cause of her hypertension?","a)coarctation of aorta
b)Essential hypertension
c)Aortic aneurysm
d)Aortaarteritis","This clinical scenario and the image showing the figure of 3 sign point towards coarctation of aorta as the cause of hypertension in this patient.
The figure of 3 sign refers to the indentation of the aorta at the coarctation site. There is pre and post-stenotic dilatation along with left paramediastinal shadow, as shown below.


other chest X-ray features in coarctation of the aorta are dilated left subclavian artery, dilated ascending aorta and notching of ribs 4-8 due to rib erosion by dilated collateral vessels.",3936-2492.PNG,A,3940-2495.PNG
Q3,A 51-year-old man complains of abdominal pain and blood-stained stools. The barium study of his intestines shows the following finding. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Intussusception
b)volvulus
c)Diverticulitis
d)ulcerative colitis","The given clinical scenario and the radiological images are suggestive of intussusception.
In intussusception, the occluding mass prolapsing into the lumen has been termed the coiled
spring appearance (barium in the lumen of the intussusceptum and in the intraluminal space). In adults, it develops due to a tumor of the bowel.
The intussusception appears as a sausage-shaped mass in a longitudinal plane or a target mass in the transverse plane on CT and USG.
Ultrasound signs include:
• Target sign (also known as the doughnut sign)



• pseudokidney sign- this is seen in the longitudinal section of the bowel
• the edematous bowel resembles renal parenchyma and
• the mesentery which is dragged into the intussusception resembles renal hilum
• Crescent in a doughnut sign.
Note: The colographic appearance of intussusception is also described as a claw sign, pincer defect, shouldering effect, and coiled-spring pattern.
option B: volvulus presents with constipation, abdominal bloating, nausea, and/or vomiting. It shows coffee bean sign
option C: Diverticulitis presents with pain in the left iliac fossa
option D: ulcerative colitis causes backwash ileitis",3936-2491.PNG,A,
Q4,A cystic lesion in the suprasellar region with calcification is seen on the MRI. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)craniopharyngioma
b)pituitary adenoma
c)Meningioma
d)oligodendroglioma","A cystic lesion in the suprasellar region with calcification is suggestive of craniopharyngioma. It is derived from Rathke’s pouch and arises near the pituitary stalk, commonly extending into the
suprasellar cistern.
other options:
option B: pituitary adenomas are seen in the sellar region. Microadenomas are best shown on    contrast-enhanced images. Macroadenomas are seen as snowman or figure of eight appearance.


option C: Meningioma is a supratentorial tumor, mainly in the parasagittal region. A classical
dural tail may be seen in intracranial meningiomas but is not pathognomic. The MRI image below shows a well-defined, hyper-intense, and homogeneously enhanced mass close to the midline
suggestive of meningioma.





option D: oligodendroglioma is exclusively found in the cerebral hemispheres, most commonly in the frontal lobes. upto 9o% of oligodendrogliomas contain visible calcification on CT. The CT
image below shows a calcified cortical mass that suggests oligodendroglioma.",3937-2493.PNG,A,Picture44.png;Picture45.png;3942-2496.PNG
Q5,personal monitoring of radiation is done by:,"a)TLD badge
b)collimators
c)Linear accelerator
d)Grid","personal monitoring of radiation is done by a TLD badge.
The TLD badge (thermoluminescent dosimeter) should be positioned according to local or
national practices. In India, one TLD badge has to be worn at the chest level inside the lead    apron if the apron is used. An additional wrist badge has to be worn for procedures requiring hands close to the primary beam.



The thermoluminescent material used is calcium sulfate doped with dysprosium or lithium
fluoride. Radiation exposure is monitored every three months. The maximum dose limit for
occupational radiation workers is 3o mSv in a year, provided the cumulative dose in a block of 5 years does not exceed 1oo mSv.
The given image shows a TLD badge.",,A,3943-2498.PNG
Q6,"The appearance of UsG at saphenofemoral junction, showing common femoral vein, common femoral artery and the great saphenous vein is called as:","a)Mickey mouse sign
b)string sign
c)Tillaux sign
d)stemmer sign","The normal anatomy of the femoral vessels and great saphenous vein at the saphenofemoral junction on USG is called the mickey mouse sign.
The given images below show the mickey mouse sign (FV- femoral vein; FA- femoral artery; GSV- great saphenous vein).




other options:
option B: String sign (of kantor) on barium studies appears as a thin, thread-like stream of contrast passing through the stenosed bowel segment, particularly in Crohn's disease.
option C: Tillaux sign is said to be positive if the mass/swelling is mobile perpendicular to the mesentery attachment line. Tillaux’s sign is seen in a mesenteric cyst.
option D: Stemmer's sign is the inability to tent the skin at the base of the toes due to skin thickening, as seen in lymphedema.",,A,3943-2497.PNG
Q7,plethoric lung fields are seen in:,"a)Total Anomalous pulmonary venous Connection
b)Tricuspid atresia
c)Ebstein anomaly
d)Tetrology of Fallot","plethoric lung fields are seen in Total Anomalous pulmonary Venous Connection (TApVC). In this condition, pulmonary venous obstruction results in pulmonary arterial hypertension, resulting in   plethoric lung fields.

Q8,A patient complains of neck stiffness and severe headache. The CT image shown below is suggestive of which of the following conditions?,"a)Meningitis
b)Subarachnoid hemorrhage
c)Intraparenchymal hemorrhage
d)Hemorrhagic stroke","The clinical manifestations of neck stiffness and severe headache with CT revealing blood in the basal cistern points out to the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is the bleeding into the subarachnoid space, which is the area between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. The diagnosis is
suspected when a hyperattenuating material is seen filling the subarachnoid space. Most   commonly this is apparent around the circle of willis, on account of the majority of berry aneurysms occurring in this region (65%), or in the Sylvian fissure (3o%).
The modified Fisher scale is a method for grading SAH as seen on non-contrast CT (NCCT). The Hunt and Hess scale describes the severity of SAH and is used as a predictor of survival.
xanthochromia on CSF is indicative of SAH in case of a negative CT scan.",3938-2494.PNG,B,
