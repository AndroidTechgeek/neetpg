Q1,The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VoR) is seen to stabilize the image on the retina while the head moves. what is the gain of VoR ( eye velocity/head velocity )?,"a)4
b)2
c)1
d)3","The gain of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is 1, which means there is a compensatory eye velocity equal to the head velocity and in the opposite direction.
VOR prevents the slipping of the retinal images when the head moves; it moves the eyes at the
same speed but in the opposite direction as the head. If an object is being pursued with eye and    head movement, vision cancels the vestibulo-ocular reflex to prevent the eyes from moving in the opposite direction as the head.
VOR is a physiological vestibular nystagmus that forms the basis of the caloric test. If cold water is poured into the right ear the patient develops left jerk nystagmus (rapid phase towards the left),    while the reverse happens with warm water, i.e. patient develops right jerk nystagmus. It can be     remembered by the mnemonic 'cOws' (cold- Opposite, warm-same).",,C,
Q2,"In ocular surface examination and dry eye staining, which of the following order of dyes is used?","a)Fluorescein -&gt;Rose Bengal -&gt; Lisssamine green
b)Rose Bengal -&gt; Lisssamine green -&gt; Fluorescein
c)Lisssamine green -&gt; Rose Bengal -&gt; Fluorescein
d)Fluorescein-&gt; Lisssamine green -&gt; Rose Bengal","Amongst the given options, the better order of dyes to pick for use in ocular surface examination and dry eye staining is Fluorescein -&gt; Rose Bengal -&gt; Lisssamine green.
Fluorescein staining of the cornea is carried out with a disposable autoclaved filter paper strip
impregnated with the dye. The denuded epithelial area seen in corneal abrasions or ulcers
appears brilliant green when stained with fluorescein. under a cobalt blue light, the stained area appears opaque green.
A corneal abrasion highlighted with fluorescein staining is shown below.





Rose Bengal stains dead and devitalized cells including mucous strands on ocular surface. The dye causes a stinging and burning sensation soon after instillation.


Lissamine green stains dead and degenerate cells, but does not stain healthy epithelial cells. It is used to diagnose ocular surface disease. It stains the conjunctiva. It does not cause stinging like   Rose Bengal. The Green staining is best observed two minutes after instillation.
The image below shows the lissamine staining of the eye.

Q3,which of the following are direct gonioscopes?,"a)1, 3
b)2, 4
c)4
d)1, 2, 3","Richardson and koeppe are direct gonioscopes.
A gonioscope is used for the measurement of the angle of the anterior chamber. The types of gonioscopes include:
• Indirect gonioprism: provides a mirror image of the opposite angle. Indirect goniolenses include Goldmann, zeiss, and posner.
• Direct gonioprism: provides a direct view of the angle. Direct goniolenses include the koeppe, Richardson, Medical workshop, Barkan, and swan–Jacob.
Applications:
• To view the angle of the anterior chamber. The structures visualized in order from front to back are:
• schwalbe’s line
• Trabecular meshwork
• scleral spur
• ciliary body band
• Root of iris
• The localization of foreign bodies, abnormal blood vessels or tumors in the angle.
• Demonstration of the extent of peripheral anterior synechiae.
• During goniotomy, a surgical procedure for the treatment of congenital glaucoma.



The below instrument is an indirect gonioscope of four-mirror type, which is used to visualize the angle of the anterior chamber.",,B,3130-1923.PNG
Q4,"on administration of phenylephrine, the following change was noted as shown in the images below. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)Nodular scleritis
b)Nodular episcleritis
c)Tenon's cyst
d)Nodular phlycten","The image shows a nodule surrounded by redness. on administration of phenylephrine, blanching of superficial episcleral vessels is seen. Hence, the probable diagnosis is nodular episcleritis.
2.5% phenylephrine can be used to differentiate episcleritis and scleritis. since the vessels of the episclera are superficial, they blanch. whereas, in scleritis, the vessels do not blanch.
Episcleritis is benign, recurrent, inflammation of the episclera, involving the overlying Tenon's
capsule but not the underlying sclera. It is more common in women than in men. It is an allergic   reaction to an endogenous toxin. It is commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Episcleritis is characterized by redness, mild ocular discomfort described as a gritty, burning, or foreign body sensation
clinically, two types of presentations may occur:
• simple episcleritis is characterized by sectorial or diffuse inflammation of the episclera.
• Nodular episcleritis is characterized by a pink or purple flat nodule surrounded by injection,
usually situated 2-3 mm away from the limbus. The nodule is firm, and tender and can be moved separately from the sclera, and the overlying conjunctiva also moves freely.
Treatment includes topical NsAIDs, corticosteroid eye drops, cold compress, and artificial tears. In recurrent cases, systemic NsAIDs are used.
scleritis refers to an inflammation of the sclera proper. It usually occurs in elderly patients (4o-7o years) involving females more than males. It is frequently associated with an underlying systemic  inflammatory condition. The patient presents with moderate to severe pain, redness, lacrimation,  photophobia, and diminution of vision.
scleritis can be classified as immune-mediated non-infectious scleritis and infectious scleritis.
Immune-mediated non-infectious scleritis is further classified as:



I. Anterior sclerltis (98%)
a. Non-necrotizing scleritis (85%)
• Diffuse
• Nodular
b. Necrotizing scleritis(13%)
1. with inflammation:
• vasa-occlusive
• Granulomatous
• surgically induced
2. without inflammation(scleromalacia perforans).
II. posterior scleritis (2%)
Treatment options include:
• Non-necrotizing scleritis- Topical steroids and systemic indomethacin.
• Necrotizing scleritis- Topical and oral steroids, immunosuppressive agents and surgical treatment like scleral patch graft.
• Infectious scleritis- Antimicrobial therapy, and surgical debridement.
other options-
option C: Tenon's cyst or conjunctival inclusion cyst is a benign condition filled with serous fluid  and slimy mucous secretions of congenital or acquired origin. Acquired cysts can occur following   strabismus surgery, pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling, and Ahmed glaucoma valve insertion. The patient presents with swelling near the limbus with no pain or redness. The consistency is
cystic to firm, non-tender with no mobility suggesting that the cyst is adherent to the underlying scleral tissue.
option D: phlycten is a white-pinkish nodule surrounded by hyperemia on the bulbar
conjunctiva near the limbus. phlyctenular conjunctivitis is a type 4 hypersensitivity reaction due to endogenous allergens like staphylococcus aureus (most common) and Mycobacterium
tuberculosis. Treatment includes topical steroids; atropine if the cornea is involved.",3123-1917.PNG,B,
Q5,Identify the marked structure in the eye.,"a)Eggers line
b)Lens capsule
c)canal of Hannover
d)canal of Petit","The marked structure represents the Canal of petit.
In front of the anterior hyaloid membrane and behind the ciliary body and zonule is the
capsulohyaloid sinus (or space), or petit's canal. This is one of the sites of retrolental
hemorrhages. This is also the route along which blood sometimes enters the lens, through some rupture in the posterior lens capsule.
other options-
option A: posterior capsule of lens has circular adhesions with anterior hyaloid surface called as the hyaloideocapsular ligaments of weiger or retrolental ligament. The circular attachment is



known as Egger's line. The potential space between the anterior hyaloid face and the posterior lense capsule with the circular attachment is referred to as the Berger's space.
option B: Lens capsule is a thin, transparent, hyaline membrane surrounding the lens which is thicker over the anterior than the posterior surface
option C: The canal of Hannover lies between orbiculo-anterocapsular and orbiculo-posterocapsular parts of zonular fibers.",3123-1916.PNG,D,3132-1924.PNG
Q6,which of the following is true about perimetry?,"a)kinetic perimetry is used in quantification and tracking of visual changes in established glaucoma
b)In static perimetry, stimulus intensity is held constant and moved centrally with detection
c)visual field defect to be classified as glaucoma, it should have the corresponding optic nerve head abnormalities
d)Early signs include generalised constriction of isopters and baring of blind spot","Early signs of glaucoma in perimetry include generalized constriction of isopters and baring of blind spot.
progression of visual field changes seen in glaucoma:
perimetry is the procedure of estimating the extent of the visual fields. There are 2 types of
perimetry - kinetic and static. In kinetic perimetry, a target of given luminance is moved from a non-seeing area in the periphery towards the center where it is perceived. In the static method,
the location of a stimulus remains fixed, with the intensity increased until it is seen by the subject (threshold is reached) or decreased until it is no longer detected.
Charting of the visual fields is useful in the diagnosis of many disease conditions such as     glaucoma, neurological disorders, and retinal diseases (e.g. retinitis pigmentosa) as well as following laser treatment of diabetic retinopathy.
other options-
option A: static perimetry (not kinetic perimetry) is used in the quantification and tracking of visual changes in established glaucoma.
option B: In kinetic perimetry (not static perimetry), stimulus intensity is held constant and moved centrally with detection.



option C: optic disc changes are much greater than visual field changes. Therefore, visual field defects need not correspond to optic nerve head abnormalities to be classified as glaucoma.

Q7,"A man with known history of diabetes has come to your clinic. His vision is 6/6. However, on retinal examination, he is classified to have severe NPDR. which of the following is not a
feature of this condition?","a)Retinal microvascular changes
b)Retinal hemorrhages
c)Disc neovascularisation
d)venous beading","Disc neovascularization is not a feature of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and is seen in proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
The important findings in severe NPDR are one or more of severe retinal hemorrhages in 4
quadrants, significant venous beading in 2 or more quadrants, and moderate intraretinal
microvascular anomalies (microaneurysms) in 1 or more quadrants. This is known as the 4-2-1 rule.
Diabetic retinopathy is used to describe retinal changes seen in diabetic patients. It is classified into the following types:
• Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR).
• Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).
• Diabetic maculopathy.
• Advanced diabetic eye disease.
Management of diabetic retinopathy includes intravitreal anti-vEGF drugs, intravitreal steroids, laser therapy, and or surgical management.
surgical management is done in the following cases:
• Tractional diabetic macular edema with NPDR:  pars plana vitrectomy (PPv) with the removal of posterior hyaloid.
• Advanced PDR with dense vitreous hemorrhage/ fibrovascular epiretinal membrane: PPv along with the removal of opaque vitreous gel/ membrane and endophotocoagulation.



• Advanced PDR with tractional retinal detachment: PPV with endophotocoagulation and reattachment of the detached retina by scleral buckling.
Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy study classification:
Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) -
• Very mild NPDR :
- Microaneurysms only.
- Management - Review in 12 months.
• Mild NPDR :
- Any or all of : microaneurysms, retinal hemorrhages, exudates, cotton wool spots, up to the level of moderate NPDR. No intraretinal microvascular anomalies (IRMA) or significant beading.
- Management - Medical control of diabetes with follow-up in 9-12 months.
• Moderate NPDR :
- severe retinal hemorrhages (about 2o medium-large per quadrant) in 1–3 quadrants or mild IRMA.
- significant venous beading can be present in no more than 1 quadrant.
- cotton wool spots commonly present.
- Management - Review in approximately 6 months.
• severe NPDR : The 4–2–1 rule; one or more of:
• severe hemorrhages in all 4 quadrants
• significant venous beading in 2 or more quadrants
• Moderate IRMA in 1 or more quadrants
• Management - Review in 4 months.
• Very severe NPDR : The 4–2–1 rule, two or more of the criteria for severe NPDR
• Review in 2–3 months.
Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR)-
• Mild to moderate PDR :
• New vessels on the disc (NVD) or new vessels elsewhere (NVE), but extent insufficient to meet the high-risk criteria.
• Management- Prompt Pan-retinal photocoagulation is done if type 2 DM in a patient &gt;4o years of age, otherwise defer PRP.
• High-risk PDR :
• New vessels on the disc (NVD) (about 1/3 disc area).
• Any NVD with vitreous hemorrhage.
• NVE greater than 1/2 disc area with vitreous hemorrhage.
• Management - Prompt pan-retinal photocoagulation.",,C,3062-1872.PNG
Q8,"Identify the filter, the dye and the condition shown below","a)cobalt green - Fluorescein dye - corneal degeneration
b)cobalt blue - Fluorescein dye - corneal ulcer
c)cobalt blue - Lissamine green dye - corneal opacity
d)cobalt green - Rose Bengal dye - Interstitial keratitis","The image depicts cobalt blue filter, fluorescein dye and corneal ulcer.
corneal ulcers can be detected with the help of fluorescein sodium dye and a cobalt blue filter.
Fluorescein staining of the cornea is carried out with a disposable autoclaved filter paper strip
impregnated with the dye. The denuded epithelial area seen in corneal abrasions or ulcers appears brilliant green when stained with fluorescein. The epithelial defect of the cornea appears opaque    green with a cobalt blue filter.
corneal epithelial lesions are visualised using vital dye staining techniques. Dyes used are:
1. Fluorescein - to delineate areas with epithelial damage. Fluorescein staining is shown below.


2. Rose Bengal - stain diseased and devitalised cells. Rose bengal staining is shown below.





3. Alcian Blue - stains excess mucus selectively.
other options :
option C : Lissamine green dye is used to stain devitalized cells of the cornea and conjunctiva. It is used to diagnose ocular surface disorders, like dry eye.
option D : Interstitial keratitis is a form of non ulcerative keratitis. It is a non suppurative
inflammation of the corneal stroma without primary involvement of the epithelium or
endothelium. It is characterized by cellular infiltration of the corneal stroma. some causes of interstitial keratitis include herpes simplex virus, syphilis, cogan syndrome and rheumatoid   arthritis.
slit-lamp examination of the cornea and conjunctiva after rose bengal staining reveals punctuate   corneal ulcerations and attached filaments of corneal epithelium in keratoconjunctivitis sicca. The image attached below sums up the various patterns of staining and their diagnostic utility.",3125-1918.PNG,B,3135-1925.PNG;3136-1927.PNG;3136-1926.PNG
Q9,A professional boxer wants vision correction surgery. which of the following is not recommended?,"a)RK
b)PRK
c)LASIK
d)SMILE","RK (Radial Keratotomy) would not be recommended to this boxer who wants vision correction surgery.
Radial keratotomy (RK) involves making deep (9o% of corneal thickness) radial incisions in the     peripheral part of cornea leaving the central 4 mm optical zone. These incisions on healing flatten the central cornea reducing its refractive power. This procedure was done to correct low to
moderate myopia (2 to 6 D). However, because of its disadvantages and advent of safe techniques (LASIK and PRK), RK is now obsolete.
Disadvantages of RK:
- cornea is weakened, increasing chances of globe rupture following trauma (RK more than PRK). Hence this procedure should not be done for patients who are at high risk of blunt trauma, such    as sports persons and military personnel.
- Irregular astigmatism from uneven healing.
- Glare at night.
Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) (option c) is the most commonly done surgery for myopia. An excimer laser beam reshapes the cornea by ablating the superficial stroma to a
predetermined extent after lifting a flap of the cornea with a sharp microkeratome. It is safer than RK.
Patient selection criteria:
- In individuals aged 21 years and above.
- In individuals who have a stable refractive error for at least 1 year.
- In individuals who have had unsatisfactory results with non-surgical treatment.
- In individuals in whom corneal-thinning disorders such as keratoconus have been ruled out.
complications:
- Tear instability (dry eye)
- wrinkling, distortion, or dislocation of the flap
- Subepithelial haze with resultant glare, especially at night.
- Persistent epithelial defects.
- Epithelial ingrowth under the flap.
- Diffuse lamellar keratitis
- corneal ectasia
- Keratoconus





other options :
option B : PRK (Photorefractive keratectomy) corrects myopia by using an excimer laser to
photoablate a central optical zone of anterior corneal stroma. This causes flattening of the central cornea. Like RK, the PRK also gives very good correction for up to -6 D of myopia but is safer.
option D : sMILE (small incision lenticule extraction) is a technique in which a lenticule of
corneal stroma is extracted using a femtosecond laser. This can correct myopia, with and without astigmatism up to 1o D.",,A,Picture30.png
Q10,A child went to an ophthalmologist and is found to have a power of -1 D spherical and -2 D cylindrical at 18o degrees. what kind of astigmatism does the child have?,"a)Simple astigmatism
b)with the rule astigmatism
c)Against the rule astigmatism
d)Mixed astigmatism","The child with a power of -1 D spherical and -2 D cylindrical at 18o degrees has with the rule    astigmatism, as the vertical meridian is greater and more curved than the horizontal meridian.
step 1 : - 1 D spherical would mean a power of -1 on vertical and horizontal axes.
| (-1)
|
--------|------- (-1)
|
|
step 2 : - 2 D cylindrical at 18o degrees, would mean a power of -2 D at 9o degrees (perpendicular to 18o).
| (-1 - 2 〓 -3)
|
--------|------- (-1)
|



|
Hence, as the vertical meridian (-3D) is greater than horizontal meridian (-1D), this would be with the rule astigmatism.
Astigmatism refers to the condition where there is different refractory power in both the principal meridians of the eye. Astigmatism is classified into two broad varieties - regular and irregular
astigmatism.
Regular astigmatism: there are two principal meridians.
with the rule -  principal meridians are vertical and horizontal; both meridians at 9o°; and the vertical meridian is more curved than horizontal.
Against the rule (option c) -  principal meridians are vertical and horizontal; both meridians at 9o°; and the horizontal meridian is more curved than vertical.
oblique - the principal meridians are not vertical and horizontal, but they are at 9o° to each other; e.g., at 45° and 135° .
Bi-oblique -  the two principal meridians are not vertical and horizontal, and they are not at       °
each other; e.g., at 4o° and 1oo° .
Irregular astigmatism: there are multiple meridians.
clinical presentation of astigmatism include asthenopia (tiredness of eyes relieved by closing the eyes), blurred vision and defective vision, elongation of objects, keeping reading material closer,  and half closure of the lid.
Tilted or oval optic disc is seen on ophthalmoscopy. Retinoscopy shows different power on the two
meridians. other investigations include keratometry, astigmatic fan test, and Jackson s cross-cylinder test.


prescription in astigmatism: There are 3 components.
1) power of the spherical component: convex (+) or concave (-) dioptre sphere (DS)
2) power of the cylinder: convex (+) or concave (-) dioptre cylinder (Dc)



3) Axis (orientation) of the cylinder other options :
option A : In simple astigmatism, one of the meridia focuses on the retina. The other meridian focuses either in front of the retina (simple myopic) or behind the retina (simple hyperopic).
Example, -1.oo DC × 18o degree.
option D : Mixed astigmatism: Light rays in one meridian are focused in front of the retina and those in the other meridian are focused behind the retina. Example, -1DS with +2DC at 18o
degree.",,B,3139-1928.PNG;3140-1929.PNG
Q11,The following instrument is used to measure which of the following?,"a)proptosis
b)squint
c)Diplopia
d)stereopsis","The image shows Hertel's exophthalmometer used to measure proptosis.
An abnormal protrusion of the globe because of a space-occupying lesion in the orbit is called
proptosis. Exophthalmometry measures protrusion of the apex of the cornea from the outer
orbital margin (with the eyes looking straight ahead). An absolute protrusion of &gt;2o mm or a difference of &gt;2 mm between the two eyes is labelled as proptosis.
Instruments used to measure proptosis:
• Hertel’s exophthalmometer: the most common instrument used. Its advantage is that it measures both eyes simultaneously.
• Luedde exophthalmometer : The simplest instrument to measure proptosis





• Naugle Exophthalmometer : This is a superior and inferior orbital rim-based instrument.
pseudoproptosis occurs when the eye has a proptotic anatomic appearance that is not caused by a mass effect from a lesion displacing the globe. pseudoproptosis is seen in high myopia (due to
increase in size of the eyeball), ipsilateral lid retraction (resultant sclera creates the impression of   the globe protruding forward) and contralateral enophthalmos (the normal orbit, which is situated more anteriorly, may simulate proptosis when there is none).",3126-1919.PNG,A,3141-1930.PNG
