Q1,"A 55-year-old male presented with verrucous carcinoma around the glans of the penis.
Examination reveals that the inguinal lymph nodes are not enlarged. what is the appropriate management for this patient?","a)Total penectomy.
b)Co2 laser excision
c)Topical 5-fluorouracil
d)partial penectomy.","The most appropriate management for this patient with verrucous carcinoma around the glans of the penis is partial penectomy.
Carcinoma of the penis is commonly a squamous cell carcinoma. It arises from the skin of the glans penis or the prepuce. The lesion can be flat or warty in appearance.
• T1- confined to the skin
• T2- invades the corpus spongiosum or cavernosum.
• T3- invades the urethra
• T4- invades adjacent structures.
The first lymph node to be involved is the superficial inguinal lymph node and thus, the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is helpful for evaluating the spread of penile cancer.
Tumors oflow-grade and low-stage are managed by Mohs’ surgery. Tumors involving the glans penis require glansectomy, and in advanced cases require partial penectomy.
other options:
option A: In penile carcinoma, total amputation of the penis is done if the stump is &lt; 2cm after resection of the tumor.
options B, and C: Topical 5-fluorouracil cream and Co2 laser ablation are preferred in case of penile intraepithelial neoplasia.",5034-3153.PNG,D,5047-3163.PNG
Q2,Identify the procedure being performed in the image given below.,"a)Intraosseous cannula for pain relief
b)Bone marrow aspiration
c)Intraosseous route access for giving IV fluids
d)Intraosseous abscess drainage","The procedure being performed in the above image is intraosseous route access for transfusing IV fluids in the anterior proximal tibia.
The intraosseous route is an alternative to the intravenous (IV) route in the transfusion of fluids in shock. The marrow of long bones has a rich network of vessels that drain into a central venous
canal, emissary veins, and ultimately the central circulation. So, the bone marrow functions as a non-collapsible venous access route.
Intraosseous cannulation is recommended for patients in whom IV access proves difficult or
unattainable. (e.g., in cardiopulmonary arrest). In such a case, if venous access is not available
within 1 min, an intraosseous needle should be placed in the anterior proximal tibia. During a
resuscitation procedure, all anesthetic drugs and fluids can be administered through intraosseous cannulae.
Insertion sites for intraosseous infusion:
• In the proximal tibia, 1-2 cm anteromedial from the tibial tuberosity
• Distal tibia at the junction of the medial malleolus and the shaft of the tibia
• Distal one-third of the femur
The response time to drug administration in intraosseous infusion is close to the IV route. Fluids should be given as boluses using a 5o mL syringe.
The image below shows the procedure of intraosseous cannulation.",5035-3154.PNG,C,5048-3164.PNG
Q3,"A diabetic patient presents with sudden-onset perineal pain. on examination, foul-smelling discharge, and necrotic tissue as seen in the image is noted. which of the following is true   about the given condition?","a)Anti-gas gangrene serum indicated for all cases
b)urinary diversion is the next step
c)Bilateral orchidectomy must be done
d)Mixed aerobic and anaerobic infection","The given condition is likely to be Fournier gangrene. It is a mixed flora aerobic and anaerobic infection.
Fournier's gangrene is a polymicrobial infection and a type of necrotizing fasciitis of the
perineum, external genitalia, and perianal region. Risk factors include immunocompromised states such as HIV, alcoholism, and diabetes. The infection may be precipitated by minor



procedures in the perineal area, such as a bruise, scratch, urethral dilatation, injection of
hemorrhoids, or opening of a periurethral abscess. The infection spreads along the dartos, scarpa, and colles fascia.
The sequence of events that lead to the development of gangrene are as follows: A mixed infection of the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria  → fulminating inflammation
of subcutaneous tissue → obliterative arteritis of the arterioles that supply the scrotal skin → gangrene.
clinical features of Fournier gangrene are scrotal pain, fever, prostration, and pallor. cellulitis spreads rapidly and may be associated with eschars, necrosis, flaking skin, and crepitus.
The testis is usually not affected.
Diagnosis is majorly clinical and very rarely made by laboratory or imaging findings.
The steps in the management of this condition:
• IV fluids
• IV antibiotics
• urgent surgical excision followed by skin grafting in later stages. wide surgical excision is often necessary.
when the infection has been controlled, a vacuum-assisted dressing may be helpful. skin grafting is essential for a patient surviving an acute episode. Despite the best therapy, mortality rates are    around 5o%.
other options:
option A: Anti-gas gangrene serum is a treatment for gas gangrene that is of historical importance and is no longer used. Treatment of gas gangrene is now done with antibiotics.
option B: while urinary diversion and other supportive measures are useful in the management of the condition, it is not the next best step.
option c: The blood supply of the testes is separate from that of the overlying skin, and hence, testes can be preserved during debridement.",5006-3137.PNG,D,
Q4,which of the following is the most common complication following ligation of the first vessel during abdominoperineal resection for rectal carcinoma?,"a)parasympathetic - bladder dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation.
b)sympathetic - bladder dysfunction and impotence.
c)sympathetic - retrograde ejaculation and bladder dysfunction.
d)sympathetic - Impotence and loss of cutaneous sensation in perineal region","The first vessel that is usually ligated during abdominoperineal resection (APR) is the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). A high inferior mesenteric artery ligation during abdominoperineal   resection can injure the superior hypogastric nerve, resulting in sympathetic dysfunction
and leading to retrograde ejaculation and bladder dysfunction.
Abdominoperineal resection is the complete excision of the rectum, anal canal, and sphincter
apparatus. This is done with the creation of a permanent colostomy. This is commonly preferred    in elderly patients with distal rectal cancer with poor sphincter function. In these patients, the end colostomy offers a better quality of life.
complications:
• Higher recurrence rates compared to low anterior resection.



• Anastomotic leaks or dehiscences
• Necrosis of the transposed colon
• Bleeding
• strictures
The sympathetic innervation of the rectum is from L1, L2, and L3, which together form the
superior hypogastric plexus. They divide into left and right hypogastric nerves at the level of the     sacral promontory supplying the rectum and the genitourinary system. A high IMA ligation during surgery can result in sympathetic dysfunction causing retrograde ejaculation.
Injury to the pelvic plexus and nervi erigentes, during the division along the pelvic side wall, can cause erectile dysfunction, impotence, and atonic bladder. Injury to the periprostatic plexus can  lead to sexual and bladder dysfunction.",,C,
Q5,A patient presents to the clinic with the lesion given in the image. He had a traumatic injury to the chest one year ago. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Hemangioma
b)Hypertrophic scar
c)keloid
d)Neurofibroma","The image showing a large area of scar tissue is suggestive of a keloid.
A keloid refers to excess accumulation of collagen at the scar site with growth of the scar tissue beyond the boundaries of the original wound. It does not regress. The patient's history of
traumatic injury to the chest one year ago, followed by the development of an expanding scar, is suggestive of a keloid. The keloid is often glossy in appearance and rubbery in texture. They are  composed of thick bundles of collagen.
Treatment of keloids usually involves intralesional injections of triamcinolone. Multiple doses are required at intervals over several weeks and may result in flattening but rarely does the wound
narrow.
option A: A hemangioma is a vascular tumor that arises from the endothelium. They typically present as red or pinkish macules or raised lesions.
option B: Hypertrophic scars, unlike keloids, remain within the boundaries of the original wound and tend to regress over time. since this scar has failed to regress over 1 year and has grown
beyond the original wound margins, it is more likely to be a keloid.
option D: Neurofibromas are benign tumors arising from schwann cells. They usually present as soft, flesh-colored nodules, often in association with neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic disorder. The patient's history of chest trauma and the appearance of the lesion make neurofibroma an
unlikely diagnosis in this case.",5036-3155.PNG,C,
Q6,"A 45-year-old male underwent bilateral laparoscopic hernia repair for inguinal hernia.  postoperatively, he complained of pain in the right thigh. which of the following nerve entrapment leads to this symptom?","a)Ilioinguinal nerve
b)Iliohypogastric nerve
c)Femoral nerve
d)Lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh","Entrapment of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh is the most likely cause of pain in this patient with history of laparoscopic hernia repair.
The laparoscopic approach is preferred for bilateral or recurrent inguinal hernias.
Transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair and total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair are the methods commonly used.



The nerves commonly injured in laparoscopic repair are the genitofemoral and lateral femoral
cutaneous nerves of the thigh. patients present with acute neuropathic pain along the dermatomal distribution. Injury to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve results in meralgia paresthetica.
Treatment consists of rest, ice, NSAIDs, physical therapy, and possible local corticosteroid and anesthetic injection. Drugs like gabapentin can be used.
In laparoscopic TApp repair, to reduce the chances of nerve injury during mesh placement, tacks are ideally placed above the iliopubic tract to avoid nerve injury.
other options:
option A: Ilioinguinal nerve may be commonly injured during open hernia repair. It leads to sensory disturbances and pain over the skin of the genitalia and upper medial thigh.
option B: Iliohypogastric nerve can be injured while making an incision in the right iliac fossa during hernia surgery.
option C: Femoral nerve can be compressed by retroperitoneal tumors or hemorrhage in patients on anticoagulants or bleeding diathesis. It presents as wasting and weakness of the quadriceps
femoris muscle making the patient difficult to walk. pain and paraesthesia are seen along the region of the distribution of the nerve.",,D,
Q7,"A patient was brought to the ER following a road traffic accident. on examination, the patient opens his eyes to a painful stimulus, speaks inappropriately, and withdraws his limbs to a
painful stimulus. what is his GCS score?","a)E2V2M3
b)E3V3M3
c)E2V3M4
d)E3V2M2","The GCS score of this patient: E2V3M4
• He opens his eyes to a painful stimulus - E2
• He produces inappropriate words only - V3
• He withdraws his limbs - M4",,C,
Q8,A patient presented with fever and abdominal pain with jaundice. Investigations showed the given findings. which of the following statements is true regarding this condition?,"a)surgery is mandatory
b)Fine-needle aspiration cytology is diagnostic
c)Angioembolization is the treatment of choice
d)Echinococcus species is involved in etiology","The given CT image shows a cyst in the liver with serpentine linear membranes seen as wavy membranes within the cyst is suggestive of hydatid disease.
Hydatid disease or echinococcosis is a zoonotic infection caused by the Echinococcus species of flatworms. Its life cycle consists of dogs as definitive hosts and humans as
abberant intermediate hosts. primary hydatid cysts most commonly occur in the liver. Most
patients are asymptomatic but when symptomatic, the patient presents with hepatomegaly, pain, and obstructive jaundice.
The first/initial imaging test is USG, and a CT scan can be used to diagnose the condition.
CT scan shows the presence of a space-occupying lesion with a smooth outline and septa. CT scan
has an accuracy of 98% in the detection of hydatid cysts and high sensitivity to the detection of daughter cysts and extra-hepatic cysts. on CT imaging, the serpent sign is seen as wavy
membranes within the cyst.



The USG of an active hydatid cyst shows multiple septations and a rosette or honeycomb appearance:


The ball of wool sign is seen on USG when the contents settle in the dependent portion of the cyst, as seen below:


on USG, the water-lily sign is seen in hydatid infections when there is detachment of the endocyst membrane, which results in floating membranes within the pericyst that mimic the appearance of a water lily.





other options:
option A: while surgical treatment of hydatid cyst is useful and effective, alternatives like
percutaneous aspiration, injection, re-aspiration (pAIR) are equally effective and are currently used.
option B: IgG ELIsA and indirect hemagglutinin assay are used for the diagnosis of hydatid cyst.
option C: Angioembolization has no role in the treatment of hydatid cyst.",5038-3157.PNG,D,5048-3164-1.png;5048-3164-2.png;5048-3164-3.png
Q9,"A 4o-year-old male patient presents with a swelling that has been slowly growing in the past 2 years. on examination, it was variable in consistency and fully mobile. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Dermoid cyst
b)parotid tumor
c)Sebaceous cyst
d)cervical lymph node","The given clinical scenario and image depict a likely case of parotid tumor, likely to be a pleomorphic adenoma.
pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign salivary gland tumor. The most commonly affected gland is the parotid gland. The superficial lobe is most commonly affected. It is also    called as mixed tumor since it has both epithelial and mesenchymal components. It most
commonly affects females around 4o years of age.
The common presenting feature is a painless swelling below, in front, or behind the ear. The
involvement of the deep lobe leads to dumbbell tumor – swelling in both the neck and oral cavity.
specific features:
• slowly growing benign tumor
• unicentric in origin
• potentially malignant
• possibility of protrusion of fringes of the tumor mass through the capsule
• Radioresistant
• usually affects adults, females &gt; males



• painless swelling
• well-defined margins
• Lobulated, firm, elastic-to-hard consistency
• Free from deeper structures
• No facial nerve involvement
• The deep lobe pushes tonsils and faucial pillars
Diagnosis is made by FNAC, which is considered the investigation of choice. open biopsy contraindicated due to chances of injury to the facial nerve and seedling of the tumor
surgery is the mainstay of treatment - superficial parotidectomy (patey's operation). Radiotherapy is considered in high-grade malignancies demonstrating extra-glandular disease, perineural
invasion, direct invasion of surrounding tissue, or regional metastases.
pathology:
Gross features:
• The tumors are rounded, well-demarcated, measuring &lt;6 cm in greatest dimension.
• They are usually encapsulated, except in some areas such as the palate.
• The cut surface is gray-white with myxoid and blue translucent areas of the chondroid (cartilage-like) stroma.


Microscopic features:
• The epithelial elements resemble ductal cells or myoepithelial cells. They are arranged as ducts, acini, irregular tubules, strands, or sheets of cells.
• These epithelial elements are dispersed within a background of loose myxoid and hyaline tissue containing islands of cartilage and, rarely, foci of bone.
The image below shows pleomorphic adenoma of the salivary gland consisting of mixed epithelial (left) and mesenchymal cell components (right).





Dermoid cysts are slow-growing benign lesions. They are mostly seen on the scalp and skull. It is made of hair, teeth, cartilage, and skin glands. other common sites are the forehead,
postauricular, and lateral part of the eyebrow.
A sebaceous cyst is derived from hair follicle infundibulum or traumatic inclusion. The most
common site of a sebaceous cyst is the postauricular sulcus or below and behind the ear lobule. Malignancy is rare.
Clinical features of a sebaceous cyst include:
• Benign swelling that is mobile, fluctuant, and fixed to the skin. It presents with a central punctum in about 7o% of cases.
• It is generally an asymptomatic, non-tender swelling. It can be painful and red if inflamed.
• It may ooze out a foul-smelling, cheese-like discharge.",5038-3156.PNG,B,5054-3165.PNG;5059-3166-1.png
Q10,A patient who is a known case of alcohol dependence syndrome presents with sudden and unintentional weight loss. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Hepatic adenoma
b)cholangiocarcinoma
c)Hepatocellular carcinoma
d)Alcoholic hepatitis","The most likely diagnosis in this patient with a history of alcohol dependence, sudden unintentional weight loss, and raised AFP is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
HCC is the most common cause of primary liver cancer. It is more commonly seen in males, and the peak age group is between 65-7o years. The main risk factor for HCC is cirrhosis and
associated chronic liver damage due to chronic infection by hepatitis B or C virus (HBV or HCV), alcohol abuse, metabolic syndrome, or hemochromatosis. The incidence of HCC is increasing
worldwide. This is contributed by the increase in HCV and HBV infections, along with lifestyle   disorders like obesity. obesity is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This progresses on to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) causing cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma. Thus, NASH and NAFLD are risk factors for HCC.
Regular surveillance, including liver imaging and monitoring of alpha-fetoprotein levels, is
recommended for high-risk populations, such as those with liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B or C infection, or significant alcohol consumption. Early detection of HCC can improve treatment



outcomes and overall prognosis.
very early HCC is treated by ablation. Early HCC with a single nodule is resected, but when there are multiple nodules over 3 cm, ablation or transplantation are considered. Intermediate-stage
HCC is treated by chemoembolization. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is used for multinodular lesions.
other options:
option A: Hepatic adenomas are benign liver tumors that are often associated with oral
contraceptive use and anabolic steroid use. The patient's history of alcohol dependence and high   alpha-fetoprotein levels are not consistent with hepatic adenoma. Additionally, hepatic adenomas are usually asymptomatic and do not present with sudden unintentional weight loss.
option B: Cholangiocarcinoma is a cancer that arises from the bile ducts within the liver. while     patients with alcohol dependence may have an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma, the elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels are not typical for this type of cancer. Cholangiocarcinomas usually
present with jaundice, pruritus, and abdominal pain, but sudden weight loss is less characteristic.
option D: Alcoholic hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver caused by excessive alcohol
consumption. It usually presents with jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain. while the patient's
history of alcohol dependence might suggest alcoholic hepatitis, elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels and unintentional weight loss are not typical for this condition. Moreover, the AST/ALT ratio is    usually greater than 2 in alcoholic hepatitis, but it is o.5 in this case.",,C,
Q11,A patient presented with features of chronic pancreatitis with recurrent attacks and has a 1o mm dilatation of the pancreatic duct with intraductal calculi present. which of the following is the surgery of choice?,"a)pancreaticoduodenectomy
b)Longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy
c)ERcp and sphincterotomy
d)coring of pancreas head","In this case of chronic pancreatitis with recurrent attacks, 1o mm dilatation of the pancreatic duct, and intraductal calculi, longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy (also known as puestow procedure or lateral pancreaticojejunostomy) is the surgery of choice. This procedure involves opening the
pancreatic duct along its length and connecting it to a loop of the jejunum, which helps to drain the obstructed pancreatic duct and alleviate pain.
patients with chronic pancreatitis mainly experience pain due to ductal hypertension or
parenchymal inflammation. Acute exacerbations in duct pressure lead to recurrent acute
attacks. The pancreatic duct dilation observed on pancreatography for chronic pancreatitis is
classically described as a chain of lakes, which reflects the presence of multiple dilations and
stenoses. Response to treatment has been found to be dependent upon the degree of preoperative pancreatic fibrosis.
Longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy, also known as the puestow procedure or lateral
pancreaticojejunostomy, is a surgical treatment primarily used for chronic pancreatitis with a dilated main pancreatic duct and intraductal calculi.
In longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy, a longitudinal incision is made along the length of the
main pancreatic duct, typically from the tail to the head of the pancreas. The dilated pancreatic
duct is then opened, and any intraductal calculi or obstructions are removed. The opened duct is   then connected to a loop of the jejunum to create a side-to-side anastomosis. This allows for the     drainage of pancreatic secretions directly into the jejunum, bypassing any narrowed or obstructed areas of the duct.



This procedure can effectively relieve pain and improve the quality of life for patients with chronic pancreatitis. However, it is important to note that it may not reverse the underlying pathology of   chronic pancreatitis or prevent the progression of the disease. It is also not suitable for all patients with chronic pancreatitis, particularly those with a non-dilated pancreatic duct or isolated head
involvement.
other options:
Pancreaticoduodenectomy: This procedure, also known as whipple procedure, involves removing the head of the pancreas, duodenum, gallbladder, and part of the bile duct. It is typically
performed for pancreatic cancer or tumors in the head of the pancreas, not for chronic
pancreatitis with ductal obstruction and intraductal calculi.
ERCP and sphincterotomy: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with
sphincterotomy is a procedure that involves opening the sphincter of oddi to facilitate the
drainage of bile and pancreatic secretions. Although it may provide temporary relief, it is not a
definitive treatment for chronic pancreatitis with large ductal dilatation and intraductal calculi.
ERCP with sphincterotomy may be useful in some cases of chronic pancreatitis for the removal of small pancreatic duct stones, but for large ductal dilatation and intraductal calculi, longitudinal
pancreaticojejunostomy is more appropriate.
Coring of pancreas head: Coring of the pancreas head, also known as pancreatic head resection or Beger procedure, is a surgical technique used to treat chronic pancreatitis, particularly when the    inflammation and fibrosis predominantly affect the head of the pancreas. The procedure involves  removing the inflamed and fibrotic tissue from the head of the pancreas while preserving the
duodenum, bile duct, and the main pancreatic duct. Longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy is a more targeted and effective treatment for this patient's condition.",,B,
Q12,A woman presented with a BIRADS-5 breast lesion. which of the following is a good prognostic factor for this lesion?,"a)BRcA-1 positive
b)p53 positive
c)ER positive
d)High ki-67","ER positivity is a good prognostic factor in breast cancer.
The ER and PR are two steroid hormone receptors present in breast cancer. The expression of these receptors indicates a favorable prognosis and response to hormonal therapy.
other options:
option A: The mutations in BRCA1 gene account for up to 4o% of familial breast cancers. These tumors are high-grade, hormone receptor–negative, and aneuploid and do not have a good
prognosis.
option B: p53 is a tumor suppressor gene, which on mutation acts as an oncogene. p53 positivity is associated with highly malignant breast cancers and has poor survival.
option D: ki-67 is used to access the proliferative index (activity) of the tumor. High ki-67 indicates a poor prognosis.",,C,
Q13,A patient presents with sudden onset of chest pain shooting to the neck and interscapular     region. X-ray shows widened mediastinum. BP is 11o/9o mmHg in the right upper limb and 16o/1oo mmHg in the left upper limb. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Acute coronary syndrome
b)Acute pulmonary embolism
c)Acute aortic dissection
d)Esophageal rupture","sudden-onset severe chest pain, with a wide discrepancy in blood pressure between the two limbs, and a widened mediastinum on x-ray point towards a diagnosis of aortic dissection.
It is initiated by an intimal tear, which allows blood to penetrate into the medial layer, producing  a cleavage plane (false lumen) between the inner two-thirds and outer one-third of the media. The true lumen is separated from the false lumen by an intimomedial flap.
classification of aortic dissection:
Acute aortic dissection can be classified by the original DeBakey system, which is based on the
location of the proximal tear and distal extent of the dissection flap, or the stanford system, which is based only on the location of the proximal tear.

	DeBakey	stanf

Type IIIbExtends to the abdo minal aorta		


clinically, patients present with tearing chest/back pain associated with diaphoresis, syncope, weakness, and dyspnea or neurological manifestations.
on examination, unequal pulses or blood pressure in the extremities may be seen due to changes of flow in the true and false lumens. There can be hypertension or hypotension, loss of pulses,
findings of aortic regurgitation, and pulmonary edema.
Imaging:



Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the investigation of choice in a hemodynamically
unstable patient. In hemodynamically stable patients, the diagnosis is established with a
contrast-enhanced CT scan. The characteristic diagnostic finding is a double-lumen aorta. The
image below shows aortic dissection in the thoracic aorta with the true lumen, as well as the false lumen. The true lumen is often the smaller of the two because of being compressed by the false     lumen.
Acute coronary syndrome and acute pulmonary embolism may both present with sudden onset
chest pain but widened mediastinum and blood pressure discrepancy make aortic dissection more likely. (options A and B)
Both sudden onset chest pain and widened mediastinum may be seen in esophageal rupture but   blood pressure discrepancy between the upper limbs makes aortic dissection more likely. (option D)

Q14,"A patient presented with right hypochondriac pain. He had an episode of diarrhea 1 week
prior. CT scan of the abdomen reveals a liver abscess of around 25 ccs. what is the next step in management?","a)PAIR
b)surgery
c)Medical therapy
d)Percutaneous drainage","This patient with an abscess in the liver with a history of diarrhea most likely has an amebic liver abscess. The initial treatment of choice for an amebic liver abscess is medical therapy
with metronidazole.
Ingestion of Entamoeba histolytica cysts causes intestinal diseases like diarrhea. Following this, the trophozoites reach the liver mostly through the portal venous system and cause amebic liver abscess. The common presenting features are right upper quadrant pain, tenderness, fever,
hepatomegaly, and diarrhea.
CT abdomen is helpful in differentiating amebic from a pyogenic abscess. A rim enhancement is noted in case of a pyogenic abscess.
The mainstay of treatment for amebic abscesses is metronidazole, which is curative in more than 9o% of patients. Luminal agents such as iodoquinol, paromomycin, or diloxanide furoate can be  administered to treat the carrier state.
Aspiration of abscess is recommended in case of
• Diagnostic uncertainty
• Failure to respond to metronidazole therapy
• Abscesses larger than 5 cm in diameter and in the left liver, since they are thought to carry a high risk of rupture",,C,
Q15,A 5o-year-old patient with a history of trauma one week back presents with confusion and   ataxia. He is on treatment for alcohol dependence and his last intake was 2 weeks back. CT scan reveals the following finding. what is the diagnosis?,"a)Extradural hemorrhage
b)subdural hemorrhage
c)Intra-parenchymal hemorrhage
d)subarachnoid hemorrhage","The given clinical scenario and the plain CT scan showing a concavo-convex-shaped hematoma on the left side with a midline shift to the right is suggestive of subdural hematoma (SDH).



An acute SDH is the result of the accumulation of blood between the arachnoid membrane and
the dura. It is usually due to the rupture of bridging veins running from the cerebral cortex to the dural sinuses. The level of consciousness is usually impaired at presentation and may deteriorate
further as the hematoma expands. Elderly and alcoholic patients are at a higher risk of acute SDH formation after head trauma due to brain atrophy. on CT scan, acute SDH appears as a
hyperdense, crescent-shaped (concavo-convex) lesion.
open craniotomy for the evacuation of acute SDH is indicated for the following:
• Thickness &gt;1 cm
• Midline shift &gt;5 mm
• Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score drops by two or more points from the time of injury to hospitalization.
Chronic subdural hematoma results from a hematoma that expands over days or weeks by
osmosis, ultimately producing symptoms of raised ICP or focal deficits. on a CT scan, diffuse hypodensity overlying the brain surface would be seen.",5040-3158.PNG,B,
Q16,which of the following is false about the given condition?,"a)Repeated radical surgery every 24 hours may be required to adequately manage this condition
b)This is a case of Meleneyls gangrene
c)The condition is caused by beta hemolytic streptococcus and may sometimes be polymicrobial
d)Hyperbaric oxygen has no role in the treatment of this condition","The given image is likely that of Meleney's gangrene. Hyperbaric oxygen has been shown to
reduce mortality in patients with Meleney's gangrene and therefore plays a significant role in the management of this condition.
Necrotizing fasciitis of the abdominal wall is known as Meleney's gangrene. It presents with
extensive necrosis of the abdominal wall, thrombosis of the microvasculature, and an acute
inflammatory infiltrate. Bullae develop on the abdominal wall, which progress to overt cutaneous   gangrene. The affected area is often painful, erythematous, and edematous, with possible systemic signs of infection such as fever and malaise. Early recognition and aggressive treatment are
essential for a favorable outcome.
Management includes prompt surgical debridement of the necrotic tissue, broad-spectrum
antibiotics to cover the polymicrobial nature of the infection, and supportive measures such as
fluid resuscitation and correction of electrolyte imbalances. In some cases, hyperbaric oxygen
therapy may be utilized as an adjunctive treatment to improve tissue oxygenation and enhance the healing process.
other options:
option A: Surgical excision of necrotic tissue is often required daily as the infection tends to spread beyond the borders of the debridement wound.
option C: Meleney's gangrene is caused by beta-hemolytic streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus and may also be polymicrobial.",5041-3159.PNG,D,
Q17,A patient presents with a swelling in the groin region and it is diagnosed as a direct inguinal hernia. weakness in which of the following structures is most likely to cause this condition?,"a)pectineal ligament
b)conjoint tendon
c)Reflected part of inguinal ligament
d)Lacunar ligament","A direct inguinal hernia is caused due to weakness in the conjoint tendon.



The innermost layers of the lateral abdominal wall contain two muscles, namely internal oblique and transverse abdominis. These muscle fibers arch over the deep inguinal ring from lateral to     medial, fuse, and become tendinous forming the conjoint tendon. The area below this arch lacks muscle and contains external oblique aponeurosis and fascia transversalis, making it weak.
Direct inguinal hernia is common in elderly patients. It is seen medial to the inferior epigastric
vessels, in Hesselbach’s triangle. This area lacks muscle and contains only fascia. other options:
option A: pectineal ligament also known as Cooper's ligament is a strong fibrous band that
extends laterally along the pectineal line from the pectineal attachment of the lacunar ligament.
option C: The inguinal ligament is external oblique aponeurosis that extends between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic tubercle. on the point of attachment to the pubic tubercle, some fibers pass upwards behind the superficial inguinal ring and external oblique aponeurosis to join    the rectus sheath and linea alba. These form the reflected part of the inguinal ligament.
option D: Lacunar ligament is formed from the fibers of the medial end of the inguinal ligament and the fibers from the fascia lata of the thigh. It forms the medial wall of the femoral canal.",,B,5062-3167.PNG
Q18,"A patient presents with sudden onset of hematemesis. He has been taking aspirin for his
arthritis and drinks alcohol occasionally. He gives a history of occasional abdominal pain. On examination, there is no abdominal mass or tenderness. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Mallory-weiss tear
b)Esophagitis
c)Peptic ulcer
d)Esophageal varices","This patient with a history of aspirin use, now presenting with abdominal pain and a sudden onset of hematemesis most likely has a bleeding peptic ulcer.
peptic ulcer disease (pUD) accounts for around 2/3rd of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The      major causative factors are Helicobacter pylori and NSAIDs. prostaglandins protect gastric and duodenal mucosa from acid and pepsin. They increase mucin and bicarbonate secretion
and increase mucosal blood flow. They also promote epithelial cell proliferation. NSAIDs like aspirin disrupt these naturally protective mechanisms and increase the risk of peptic ulcer
formation in the stomach and the duodenum.



They present with abdominal pain, bleeding, or signs of peritonitis due to perforation. significant hemorrhage occurs when duodenal or gastric ulcers penetrate branches of the gastroduodenal or  left gastric arteries, respectively.
other options:
option A: Mallory-weiss tears are partial-thickness tears of the mucosa and submucosa occurring near the gastroesophageal junction. They occur in patients with a history of repeated emesis and   are classical in alcoholic patients after a period of intense retching and vomiting following binge    drinking.
option B: Esophagitis commonly occurs due to repeated exposure of mucosa to the acidic gastric secretions in gastroesophageal reflux disease. It results in chronic blood loss and commonly
presents as anemia or guaiac-positive stools. ulcerations of superficial mucosa due to esophagitis generally do not bleed acutely.
option D: Esophageal varices commonly occur due to portal hypertension in patients with
cirrhosis. A history of liver disease or the stigmata of portal hypertension and cirrhosis would suggest variceal bleeding.",,C,
Q19,"A construction worker came to the OPD complaining of white fingers. He has been working in the cement and concrete industry and has been working on heavy machinery drills, wood,
and furniture polishing for 2o years. what is the most likely etiology for this condition?","a)candidal infection of the fingers due to continuous exposure to water
b)Exposure to thinners and paints
c)continuous exposure to cement and concrete
d)continuous exposure to drills and machines","The clinical vignette suggests the diagnosis of Raynaud's syndrome due to chronic exposure to drills and machines (vibrating tools).
Raynaud's syndrome occurs due to peripheral vasospasm, and it is more common in the upper extremities. It may occur due to exposure to various stimuli, including cold temperatures,
tobacco, or emotional stress, and certain occupational groups, such as those who use vibrating    tools, or it can be secondary to scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, sjogren's syndrome, and antiphospholipid syndrome.
The pathophysiology behind Raynaud's syndrome is believed to be due to increased levels of
α2-adrenergic receptors and their hypersensitivity and also due to an abnormal thermoregulatory response by the sympathetic nervous system.
A Raynaud's phenomenon attack is sudden, and it ranges from intense pallor (white attack) to cyanosis (blue attack), followed by reactive hyperemia due to subsequent relaxation of blood
vessels. It typically affects fingers (distal areas), and the thumb is usually spared. If the thumb is involved, it may indicate underlying secondary etiology. other common complaints include pin   and needles sensation, numbness, or finger aches or pain. In severe attacks, digital ulcerations    and gangrene may develop.
Diagnosis is primarily based on the clinical history and physical examination. Nail fold capillary microscopy can be helpful, particularly for identifying secondary Raynaud's phenomenon
associated with connective tissue diseases. Angiography can be done for patients with digital ulcerations and gangrene.
Management is mainly conservative, and it includes wearing gloves, use of electric or chemically activated hand warmers, avoiding occupational exposure to vibratory tools, abstinence from
tobacco, and relocating to a warmer, dryer climate.
other management options:



• calcium channel–blockers such as diltiazem and nifedipine are the drugs of choice.
• Fluoxetine has been shown to reduce the frequency and duration of vasospastic episodes.
• prostaglandins can be used in patients with severe symptoms.
complications, including digital ulcerations and gangrene, can be surgically treated by
debridement and amputation, respectively.",,D,

mucin. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Adenoma
b)choristoma
c)Hamartoma
d)carcinoma","The given features are suggestive of a juvenile polyp, which are a type of hamartomatous polyp.
They are benign growths that are composed of a disorganized mixture of different types of tissues.
Juvenile polyps are malformations of epithelium and lamina propria commonly located in the rectum. It is seen in children &lt;5 years of age. The typical presentation is painless rectal
bleeding. sometimes, there may be a proliferating rectal mass.
The disease may be sporadic or syndromic.
• sporadic juvenile polyp occurs as a single mass and is called a retention polyp.
• Juvenile polyposis syndrome is characterized by multiple hamartomatous polyps, which may be premalignant.
Morphologically, both of these types are indistinguishable.
• Gross appearance: They appear as pedunculated, smooth reddish lesions, and with cystic spaces.
• Microscopic appearance: The cysts appear as dilated glands filled with mucin and inflammatory debris.


Adenoma: Adenomas are benign tumors that arise from glandular tissue. while they may present with rectal bleeding, they are not commonly seen in young children and are not typically
pedunculated like juvenile polyps.



choristoma: choristomas are non-neoplastic masses that arise from heterotopic tissue, i.e., tissues found in abnormal locations. They are not associated with juvenile polyps.",,C,5062-3167-1.png

Q23,A patient comes to the casualty with a severe headache. His BP was found to be 16o/1oo mmHg. CT scan revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage. what is the next best step in the  management of this patient?,"a)Nimodipine
b)Angiography
c)surgery
d)Fibrinolytic therapy","In this patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), the next step is to do an angiography to see the vascular anatomy and identify the site of bleed.
Trauma is the commonest cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Spontaneous SAH usually results     from the rupture of an aneurysm or an arterio-venous malformation (AVM). patients present with a sudden and severe headache which is different from any headache they have experienced before. This is described as a thunderclap headache. other symptoms include meningitic features like
neck rigidity and photophobia, impaired consciousness, intraocular hemorrhages, with or without focal neurological deficits. Compression from a posterior communicating artery aneurysm would   result in third nerve palsy.
Non-contrast CT head is the first imaging to be done in a suspected case, which would confirm bleeding in more than 98% of cases. In patients with high suspicion and a negative CT, lumbar puncture is done to detect hemoglobin breakdown products like oxyhemoglobin and bilirubin.
After confirming the diagnosis, CT or MR angiography is done to locate the aneurysms or AVM. Digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard investigation.
The definitive management of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is done surgically by craniotomy and clipping or by endovascular embolization known as coiling. This prevents rebleeding of the   aneurysm.
patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage are at risk of developing complications such as
rebleeding, cerebral vasospasm, hydrocephalus, seizures, and hyponatremia. Early recognition
and management of these complications are essential to improve outcomes. In addition to surgery and nimodipine, other management strategies for SAH include strict blood pressure control,
analgesia for headache, antiemetics, and anticonvulsants if seizures occur. Maintaining a close monitoring of the patient's neurological status, intracranial pressure, and electrolytes is also     crucial.
other options



Nimodipine: Although it is used to prevent cerebral vasospasm and delayed ischemic neurological deficits, it is not the immediate next step in the management of sAH. Angiography is needed first  to locate the aneurysms or AVM. It is administered after the procedure.
surgery: Although surgery is an important management option for sAH, it is not the immediate next step. Angiography must be done first to identify the site of the bleed and plan for the
appropriate surgical or endovascular intervention.
Fibrinolytic therapy: This option is not appropriate for the management of sAH as it may
exacerbate the bleeding. Fibrinolytic therapy is used in the treatment of ischemic stroke, not hemorrhagic stroke.",,B,
Q24,A 2o-year-old female patient consumed a cleaning product containing 9o% sodium   hydroxide. she is having complete dysphagia. what is the best step in management?,"a)Esophagojejunostomy
b)stent placement
c)Feeding jejunostomy
d)Gastrojejunostomy","This patient with a corrosive esophageal injury with complete dysphagia requires a feeding jejunostomy for enteral feeding.
The injury caused by alkali ingestion is deeper due to the process of saponification of fats and dehydration. The injury caused by acids is more superficial because they cause coagulative
necrosis with eschar formation, which prevents the deeper penetration of the acid.
severe corrosive injury may lead to esophageal perforation, bleeding, stricture, and death.
patients can develop dysphagia or odynophagia, which implies esophagal damage.
Minor injuries cause mucosal edema that resolves rapidly with no late sequelae and these patients can be safely fed. In case of severe injuries, a feeding jejunostomy may be appropriate until the
patient can swallow saliva satisfactorily.
Management of corrosive esophagitis:
• Hemodynamic stabilization and management of patient's airway
• Endoscopic evaluation of injuries
• surgical management includes laparotomy for bleeding or perforation. Esophageal replacement is done for very long or multiple strictures.
stenting is used in patients who do not respond to repeated dilatations for esophageal strictures. They are not used as a treatment in acute settings.",,C,
Q25,A 23-year-old male patient presents with midline swelling in the neck. The swelling moves with deglutition and protrusion of the tongue. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)Brachial cyst
b)Thyroglossal cyst
c)Plunging ranula
d)Dermoid cyst","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of a thyroglossal cyst. It moves with deglutition, protrusion of the tongue, and side-to-side movement is also possible.
A thyroglossal duct cyst is a congenital midline neck swelling that typically presents during childhood often noticed after an upper respiratory infection.
A thyroglossal cyst represents the persistence of the track of the thyroid gland and can be found
adjacent to the midline. The thyroid gland descends early in fetal life from the base of the tongue   towards its position in the lower neck. At the time of descent, the hyoid bone has not been formed



and the track of the thyroid gland is variable, passing in front, through, or behind the eventual position of the hyoid body.
It can occur anywhere along the migratory course of the duct:
• Infrahyoid (most common site)
• Region of thyroid cartilage
• suprahyoid
• Floor of mouth
• Beneath foramen cecum
clinical features of thyroglossal cyst:
• classically the cyst moves upwards on swallowing and on tongue protrusion. This indicates attachment to the hyoid bone.
• swelling is smooth, soft, fluctuant (cystic), nontender, mobile, and shows transillumination.
• Thyroid fossa is empty, if there is no thyroid in the normal location.
complications of thyroglossal cyst:
• The most common complication is infection.
• Thyroglossal fistula is an acquired condition that either follows infection of the cyst which bursts open or due to inadequate removal of the cyst.
• 1% of thyroglossal duct cysts are found to be malignant of which the most common type of cancer is papillary (85%).
However, only the thyroglossal cyst moves with tongue protrusion. This is because the duct extends from the foramen cecum of the tongue to the isthmus of the gland.
sistrunk’s operation is performed to excise the cyst and prevent a recurrence. It
involves excision of the whole thyroglossal tract, involving removal of the body of the hyoid bone, and suprahyoid tract through the tongue base to the vallecula at the site of the primitive foramen cecum along with the core of tissue on either side.

Q26,A 54-year-old woman presents with cervical cancer stage 2A. It is decided to give neoadjuvant chemotherapy. what does neoadjuvant chemotherapy mean?,"a)chemotherapy given along with radiation
b)chemotherapy given during surgery
c)chemotherapy given before radical surgery to reduce bulk of tumor
d)chemotherapy given after radical surgery for micrometastases","Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is defined as chemotherapy given before the definitive treatment (usually surgery) to reduce the bulk of the tumor.
Neoadjuvant therapy is a type of induction therapy that is given before the definitive surgery
to downstage the tumor, reduce the morbidity of treatment, know the in vivo response of the
tumor to therapy, and increase its chances of success. chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or hormonal therapy can be given as neoadjuvant therapy.
option A: Treatment that involves the administration of chemotherapy along with radiation is called chemoradiation.



option B: Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is used during surgery in which a hyperthermic solution of anticancer drugs is infused directly into the abdominal cavity after the
definitive surgery to kill any residual tumor cells. It is often used to treat cancers that have spread to the peritoneum.
option D: Treatment given after surgical resection of the tumor to reduce the risk of recurrence
and micrometastasis is called adjuvant therapy. Adjuvant therapy can be chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, or biological therapy.",,C,
Q27,"A young patient is admitted with a history of fever for 5 days. BP is 9o/6o mmHg, PR-12o
bpm, RR-24 breaths/min, Gcs score-1o; laboratory tests show leucocytosis with neutrophilia   and serum creatinine level of 2.6 mg/dL. An intern doctor wants to calculate the qsoFA score to predict prognosis and hospitalization duration. which of the following comprises the
qsoFA score?","a)BP, RR and cBc
b)creatinine, PR, BP
c)RR, Body temperature, PR
d)SBP, RR, GCS Score","qsoFA score comprises of sBP, RR, and GCs.
qsoFA score (quicksoFA) is a bedside prompt that may identify patients with suspected infection who are at greater risk for a poor outcome outside the intensive care unit (ICU).
It uses three criteria, assigning one point each for
• low blood pressure (sBP≤1oo mmHg),
• high respiratory rate (≥22 breaths/min),
• altered mentation (GCs score, &lt;15).
The score ranges from o to 3 points. The presence of 2 or more qsoFA points is a simple prompt   to identify infected patients outside the ICU who are likely to develop sepsis. This is a simplified     derivative of soFA score. The primary method to evaluate the risk of organ dysfunction (sepsis) in patients with suspected infection is by determining the sequential (sepsis-related) organ Failure    Assessment (soFA) score, which includes assessment of:
• Circulation - systolic BP and need for vasopressors; platelet count
• Respiration - Pao2/Fio2 and need for mechanical ventilation
• Mentation - Glasgow Coma scale score
• Hepatic function - Bilirubin level
• Renal function - Creatinine level
organ dysfunction is defined by a soFA score of ≥2.
The soFA score is limited by its requirement of multiple laboratory tests which makes it complex and time-consuming. In order to simplify the scoring process, the ""sepsis - 3"" task force
recommended the quick sepsis-related organ dysfunction assessment ""qsoFA"" score.
soFA vs. qsoFA:
• soFA is a more comprehensive and accurate scoring system, which is particularly superior to qsoFA in the ICU setting.
• qsoFA is a simplified derivative of soFA for bedside assessment of individuals at risk for
sepsis, particularly useful outside the ICU setting (i.e. ward/emergency department). However,
note that it was originally designed as a predictive tool that calculates the risk of death from sepsis rather than a diagnostic tool.



Thereby, the best description of sepsis based on ""sepsis-3"" task force recommendations would be as follows:
• suspected or documented infection with soFA score of ≥2  or
• suspected or documented infection with qsoFA score of ≥2
Another score that has been used is the National Early Warning score (NEWs). It ranges from o to 2o and is based on respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, use of supplemental o2, temperature,  systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and level of consciousness. ≥5 out of 2o is considered a
positive score.
other scoring systems for sepsis:
The systemic Inflammatory Response syndrome (sIRs) score is no longer recommended as is it not specific to infection.
The Logistic organ Dysfunction system (LoDs) score is not recommended as it is complex and has too many variables.",,D,
