Q1,"A child with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis has multiple episodes of non-bilious
vomiting. which of the following metabolic abnormality is likely to be seen in this condition?","a)Hypochloremic, hypokalemic acidosis
b)Hypochloremic, hypokalemic alkalosis
c)Hypokalemic hyperchloremic alkalosis
d)Hyperchloremic hypokalemic acidosis","Multiple episodes of non-bilious vomiting in infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) lead to hypochloremic hypokalemic alkalosis.
Emesis causes loss of gastric fluid containing H+ ions, leading to the release of bicarbonate into the bloodstream. without normal neutralization in the small intestine, metabolic alkalosis
develops. This is the generation phase of alkalosis.
volume depletion during vomiting hinders the urinary excretion of bicarbonate. This is due to     reduced glomerular filtration, increased proximal tubule resorption of sodium and bicarbonate,  and elevated aldosterone levels promoting bicarbonate resorption and hydrogen ion secretion in the collecting duct. This is the maintenance phase.
Loss of chloride ions in the gastric acid leads to hypochloremia.
Hydrogen ions exit from the cells in exchange for potassium leading to hypokalemia. Loss of fluid due to excessive vomiting activates the RAAS pathway. This worsens hypokalemia as the
aldosterone causes active reabsorption of sodium in exchange for the secretion of K+ and H+ ions into the urine.  The loss of H+ ions in urine lowers the urinary pH, resulting
in paradoxical aciduria.
Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is associated with hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the pylorus resulting in constriction and obstruction of the gastric outlet. It is
common between 3 and 6 weeks of age. First-born male infants are at the highest risk.
Infants usually present with projectile, non-bilious vomiting. clinically, an olive-shaped mass is  palpable in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium. when the infant is given a test feed, visible peristalsis is usually observed moving from left to right (not from right to left), followed by
projectile vomiting. It is associated
with hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria.
ultrasound examination is the investigation of choice for this condition. The diagnostic criteria for pyloric stenosis are a muscle thickness of ≥4 mm and a pyloric length of ≥16 mm. The nipple
sign is produced by the double-layered hypertrophic mucosa that protrudes into the stomach. The sonographic appearance of the hypertrophied pylorus resembles that of the uterine cervix and is    therefore called the cervix sign.
The image below shows the cervix and nipple sign seen in IHPS:





Management includes the correction of metabolic abnormality prior to surgery. Administering 5% dextrose and o.45% saline with added potassium at a rate of 15o-175 mL/kg per 24 hours can
correct the fluid deficit in infants. Monitoring urine output (&gt;2 cc/kg/h) is important to ensure successful rehydration.
The hypertrophic pylorus is surgically corrected by Ramstedt’s pyloromyotomy (open or
laparoscopic approach). It involves splitting the pyloric muscle while preserving the underlying submucosa.",,B,5633-3584.PNG
Q2,"A 6-year-old girl born out of nonconsanguineous marriage presented with rachitic changes in limbs since 1½ years of age for which she has received multiple courses of vitamin D.
Investigations showed the following. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)vitamin D dependent rickets
b)Hypoparathyroidism
c)chronic renal failure
d)Hypophosphatemic rickets","A history of resistant rickets with normal levels of calcium (9 to 11 mg/dL), parathyroid hormone (PTH), arterial blood gas (ABG), with decreased phosphate (normal - 2.5 to 4.3 mg/dL), and
elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (normal, 33 to 96 U/L) in a child is suggestive of hypophosphatemic rickets.
Hypophosphatemic rickets:
X-linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) is the most common genetic cause of rickets while the most common, overall is nutritional vitamin D deficiency. Mutations in the PHEX gene  (phosphate-regulating endopeptidase on x chromosome) leads to increased FGF-23
(phosphatonin), which inhibits phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubule levels and hence, causes increased excretion of phosphate. It also inhibits renal 1-alpha hydroxylase leading to
reduced 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D.
causes of hypophosphatemic rickets include familial vitamin D resistance, autosomal dominant
hypophosphatemic rickets, autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets, tumor-induced rickets, Mccune Albright syndrome, epidermal nevus syndrome, and neurofibromatosis.
In X-linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets lower extremity abnormalities, short stature, poor growth, delayed dentition, and tooth abscesses are common.
The chart attached below summarizes the evaluation of hypophosphatemic rickets.





Patients with hypophosphatemic rickets respond well to oral phosphorus and 1,25-D
(calcitriol). Phosphorus supplementation is usually given in 1-3 g elemental phosphorus divided into 4–5 doses. Frequent dosing reduces diarrhea, which is a complication of high-dose oral
phosphorus.
Calcitriol is administered 3o–7o ng/kg/day divided into 2 doses. Burosumab, a monoclonal antibody to FGF-23 can be used in children &gt; 1 year of age with XLH rickets.
Further, Joulie's solution is also useful in the treatment of familial hypophosphatemic
rickets. Joulie's solution includes contains 3o.4 mg of phosphate/mL. The most common side effect is diarrhea.
other options:
option A: vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1A is due to mutation in the gene coding for
1α-hydroxylase leading to reduced calcitriol levels (1,25-D). Type 1B is due to a mutation in the
gene for 25-hydroxylase leading to reduced calcidiol (25-D). Type 2A have mutations in the gene coding for vitamin D receptor. Type 2B is due to the over-expression of a hormone response
element-binding protein that interferes with the actions of 1,25-D. All of them have normal to low calcium levels, low phosphorus, elevated PTH and ALP levels.
option B: Hypoparathyroidism will present with features of hypocalcemia. There will be a decrease in serum PTH levels and calcium levels.
option C: In chronic renal failure, 1α-hydroxylase activity is reduced leading to reduced 1,25-D. They have normal to low calcium levels and elevated PTH and ALP levels. They have
hyperphosphatemia due to decreased renal excretion of phosphate.

Q3,"During the anthropometric evaluation, the height for age of a child is &lt; - 2SD. This is most likely due to?","a)chronic malnutrition
b)Acute malnutrition
c)Recent infection
d)No malnutrition","Low height for the age (height for age &lt; -2SD) in children indicates chronic malnutrition and stunting.
classification of nutritional status depending on the anthropometry (height/length for age):
Nutritional status is often assessed in terms of anthropometry:
• Low weight for height, or wasting, indicates acute malnutrition.
• High weight-for-height indicates overweight.
• Low height-for-age, or stunting, indicates chronic malnutrition. This is the best indicator of long-term nutritional status in the pediatric population.
• Low weight-for-age indicates acute or chronic malnutrition. It does not differentiate between wasting and stunting. Hence, it has limited clinical significance.
Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAc) is an age-independent parameter used for the screening of wasting in children. In children aged 6 months to 5 years, MUAc &lt;11.5cm is classified as severe malnutrition.

classification	criteria
Moderatelystunted (or) mode rate chronic malnutrition	Height/length-for-age< (–2 S D)and> (–3 SD)

Q4,A child presents with generalised edema and was found to have hypercholesterolemia. urine analysis shows protein 3+ and fat bodies. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)Nephrotic syndrome
b)Nephritic syndrome
c)Goodpasture's disease
d)IgA nephropathy","The clinical scenario showing a child with generalized edema, hyperlipidemia, massive
proteinuria, and fat bodies in urine is highly suggestive of nephrotic syndrome.
Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by nephrotic range proteinuria/heavy proteinuria &gt;3.5
g/24 hr or urine protein: creatinine ratio &gt; 2 and is associated with a triad of hypoalbuminemia (≤2.5 g/dL), edema, and hyperlipidemia (cholesterol &gt; 2oo mg/dL).
Nephrotic syndrome in children is primarily idiopathic, with minimal change disease being the   most common glomerular lesion. podocyte injury or genetic mutations in podocyte proteins can lead to nephrotic-range proteinuria.
Edema is the most common presenting symptom. They have elevated levels of cholesterol,    triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). It is caused by both increased lipid synthesis and decreased lipid catabolism.
They are prone to infections especially by encapsulated bacteria due to factors such as urinary    losses of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and complement factors (C3, C5, factors B and D). Nephrotic syndrome is a hypercoagulable state due to vascular stasis, increased platelet, increased hepatic production of fibrinogen, and urinary losses of antithrombotic factors such as antithrombin III  and protein S.
The diagnosis is confirmed by performing a urinalysis and urine protein: creatinine ratio. The
recommended initial treatment for nephrotic syndrome is a daily dose of 2mg/kg (max 6omg) of prednisolone for 6 weeks followed by an alternate dose of 1.5mg/kg (max 4omg) for the next 6-8 weeks.
Definitions regarding the course of nephrotic syndrome:
• Remission is characterized by a urine protein: creatinine ratio of &lt;o.2 or &lt;1+ protein on urine dipstick testing for 3 consecutive days



• Response in nephrotic syndrome is defined as achieving remission within the initial 4 weeks of corticosteroid therapy
• Relapse is indicated by an increase in urine protein: creatinine ratio &gt;o.2 or a reading of 2+ and higher for 3 consecutive days.
• Frequently relapsing: ≥2 relapses in 6 months or 4 relapses in 12 months.
• steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome: Relapse during steroid tapering or within 2 weeks of discontinuation.
• steroid resistance: Failure to achieve remission despite therapy with daily prednisolone for 4 weeks and alternate days for the next 4 weeks.
other options :
option B: Nephritic syndrome classically presents with tea- or cola-colored urine (hematuria), edema, hypertension, and oliguria.
option C: Goodpasture disease is an autoimmune condition characterized by pulmonary
hemorrhage, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and elevated anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody levels.
option D: IgA nephropathy is an immune complex-mediated disease, with a predominance of IgA within glomerular mesangial deposits. They present with gross hematuria and proteinuria.",,A,
Q5,"A young child with congenital hydrocephalus was treated with a successful
ventriculoperitoneal (vp) shunt. Four months post surgical repair, the child presented with fever, nuchal rigidity, and irritability. You suspect meningitis. what is the next best step?","a)wait and watch
b)Check shunt patency by nuclear study
c)Blood culture and take CSF sample from shunt tap
d)Blood culture and take CSF sample by lumbar puncture","In a child with suspected shunt-associated meningitis, the next best step useful in confirming the   diagnosis is by taking a blood culture and a CsF sample from a shunt tap is preferable to a lumbar puncture (Lp) (option D).
shunt aspiration allows for better detection of microbes and avoids the need for a separate
procedure, reducing the risk of contamination. Vp shunt fluid is obtained from a subcutaneous reservoir using a 25-gauge needle.
Bacterial meningitis may be caused due to meningococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae, or
Haemophilus influenzae type b. The clinical presentation of meningitis in children with Vp shunts is similar to acute bacterial meningitis in other children. These include fever, rash, vomiting, and   refusal to feed. Clinical signs of meningeal irritation (kernig and Brudzinski signs) are not usually  seen in infants.
Blood cultures should be done in all cases of suspected meningitis. Treatment is aggressive with systemic antibiotics. Third-generation cephalosporins along with vancomycin can be used. wait and watch policy is not followed (option A).
A ventriculoperitoneal (Vp) shunt is used to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid (CsF) due to an
obstruction in the normal outflow or there is a decreased absorption of the fluid. A silicone rubber device with a proximal portion inserted into the ventricle, a unidirectional valve, and a distal
segment is commonly used for shunt placement.
Complications of the shunting procedure include infection due to skin flora entering the shunt
(staphylococcus epidermidis), intracerebral or intraventricular hemorrhage, shunt over drainage, shunt nephritis, shunt disconnection, obstruction, inguinal hernia, and seizures.



Shunt patency studies are performed to determine whether shunt revision surgery is needed in the malfunctioned ventriculoperitoneal shunt. This is done using radionucleotides (option B)
Hydrocephalus represents a group of conditions that result from impaired circulation or absorption of CSF.
Causes of communicating hydrocephalus (increased production or reduced absorption) includes choroid plexus papilloma, meningeal malignancy, and meningitis. Causes of noncommunicating (obstructive) hydrocephalus include aqueductal stenosis, infectious (toxoplasmosis, mumps),
Chiari malformation, Dandy-walker malformation, and mass lesions.
In infants, signs include rapid head enlargement, bulging fontanel, and downward eye deviation. Long-tract signs and dilated scalp veins may also be observed. older children may experience
irritability, lethargy, poor appetite, vomiting, and headaches. Diagnosis can be done using MRI, ultrasound, and measurement of ICP.
Medical management with medications like acetazolamide and furosemide can provide temporary relief, but long-term outcomes are often unsatisfactory. Most cases require surgical intervention,   such as ventriculoperitoneal shunting or endoscopic third ventriculostomy.",,C,
Q6,"In fetal circulation, which vessel carries deoxygenated blood back to the placenta?","a)umbilical vein
b)umbilical artery
c)Descending aorta
d)pulmonary Artery","umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood back to the placenta during the fetal period. The umbilical vein carries oxygenated blood away from the placenta.
Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, except for
the pulmonary and umbilical arteries which carry deoxygenated blood.
The blood gets oxygenated in the placenta and this passes to the umbilical vein (po2 3o to
35mmHg). From the umbilical vein, 5o% of the blood enters the hepatic circulation and 5o% bypasses the liver to enter the inferior vena cava (IVC) (po2: 26 - 28mmHg) through ductus   venosus.
The right atrium receives the oxygenated blood from the IVC and superior vena cava (less
oxygenated). The right atrial pressure is more than the left atrial pressure resulting in the major flow of blood from the right atrium to the left atrium via the foramen ovale. The blood from the  left atrium flows to the left ventricle. The upper part of the fetal body (coronaries, cerebral
arteries, and upper extremities) is exclusively perfused by the left ventricle via the ascending aorta.
The major portion of this blood bypasses the lung and flows from the pulmonary artery into the descending aorta via the ductus arteriosus. Finally, some of this blood from the aorta and the
lower parts of the body is pumped back to the placenta via umbilical arteries.
A schematic diagram of fetal circulation is given below:






The concept of fetal circulation and the various embryological remnants of the vascular entities of fetal circulation is a high-yield frequently tested topic in NEET-PG examination.  The concepts are summarized in the pearl attached below.",,B,5639-3588.PNG;5639-3587.PNG
Q7,"A 1o-year-old boy presented with seizures. His past history is significant for an episode of fever with rash at 1 year of age which resolved spontaneously. what is the most helpful
investigation to diagnose his condition?","a)IgG measles in CSF
b)MRI mesial temporal lobe sclerosis
c)IgM measles in CSF
d)C1Q4 antibodies in the CSF","The clinical scenario of a child with a previous history of fever with rash at 1 year, now presenting with seizures, is highly indicative of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare chronic
complication of measles. Anti-measles antibodies are elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (IgG &gt;IgM); hence, it is the most helpful investigation to diagnose this condition.
SSPE is a fatal progressive demyelinating disease caused by chronic CNS infection with
the genetically altered variant of the measles virus. It occurs several years after primary measles infection and is more common in males.



Clinical manifestations progress through four stages:
• stage I: involves mild symptoms like irritability and poor school performance.
• stage II: is characterized by myoclonic seizures.
• stage III:choreoathetosis, immobility, dystonia, lead-pipe rigidity, and cognitive decline are seen.
• stage IV: leads to coma and death.
Diagnosis of ssPE is established by documentation of a compatible clinical course along with one of the following supporting findings: elevated measles antibody (IgG &gt;IgM) in CsF analysis or   characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns, suppression-burst episodes (high voltage    sharp slow waves) or typical histological findings or isolation of virus from brain tissue.
CT and MRI show evidence of multifocal white matter lesions, cortical atrophy, and ventricular
enlargement. Increased T2 signaling in the white matter of the brain is seen as the disease progresses (shown below):


Treatment is mainly supportive. Isoprinosine along with interferons is said to have additional
effects. Carbamazepine is found to be useful in controlling myoclonic jerks in the early stages of the illness.
In measles, after an incubation period of 8-12 days, the prodromal phase starts with mild fever     and is followed by conjunctivitis, photophobia, coryza, cough, and increasing fever. koplik spots, appearing 1-4 days prior to the rash, are a characteristic sign of measles. The rash (shown below) appears on the 4th day of fever and typically begins on the forehead (around the hairline),
and behind the ears, as a red maculopapular eruption.





The most common complication of measles is acute otitis media. The most common cause of
death in measles is pneumonia. Low serum retinol levels in children with measles are associated    with higher morbidity and mortality and hence vitamin A therapy is indicated for all patients with measles.
other options:
option B: A common cause of temporal lobe epilepsy is mesial (medial) temporal sclerosis. It is the most common cause of surgically remediable partial epilepsy in adolescents and adults. It
is often preceded by febrile seizures. pathologically, these patients have atrophy and gliosis of the hippocampus. MRI shows hippocampal sclerosis (shown below).


option D: C1Q4 antibodies in the CSF are seen in neuromyelitis optica. Neuromyelitis optica, also known as Devic’s disease, is an aggressive inflammatory demyelinating disorder characterized by   recurrent attacks of optic neuritis and myelitis.",,A,5640-3589.PNG;5641-3591.PNG;5641-3590.PNG
Q8,A 16-month-old boy is found to weigh 8kg. A WHO growth chart(weight-for-age) is provided  below. plot the growth chart for this child. What is the most appropriate advice based on the plotted graph?,"a)No malnutrition - Assure the mother
b)Mild malnutrition - home treatment
c)severe malnutrition - refer to nutrition rehabilitation center
d)Moderate malnutrition - teach the mother on how to feed","The weight for age of the child falls in between -2SD and -3SD as shown in the growth chart
below, which is suggestive of moderate malnutrition and the mother should be taught to feed the baby properly.


The primary treatment in mild and moderate malnutrition involves providing sufficient protein and energy intake, with a recommended minimum of 15o kcal/kg/day. Nutritious home food is   advised, and frequent feeding (up to 7 times a day) may be required to achieve the necessary
energy intake. High-fat foods are often used to increase energy in therapeutic diets.
Animal-source foods, such as milk and eggs, are recommended by wHO as they provide necessary amino acids and nutrients. plant-source foods like legumes and cereals can also be good protein     sources. A slight increase in protein intake (3g/kg/day) is sufficient for catch-up growth with high    energy intake. Milk and vegetable protein mixtures can be used as a protein source and adequate   minerals and vitamins are also added.
weight gain is the best measure of treatment efficacy for mild and moderate malnutrition.
Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) should be referred to a hospital for proper management.
uncomplicated SAM can be managed at home under supervision. complicated SAM should be treated as an inpatient.
Management of SAM is summarized in the image below.





The World Health Organization(WHO) has established international standards for normal child    growth from birth to 5 years of age. The normalization of the anthropometric measures is done in terms of z-scores (standard deviation scores). The anthropometric indicators are marked in a
growth chart which is compared with a reference curve.
The anthropometric measures used are weight for age, height for age, weight for height, BMI, and mid-upper arm circumference.
• Low weight for height, or wasting, indicates acute malnutrition.
• High weight-for-height indicates overweight.
• Low height-for-age, or stunting, indicates chronic malnutrition. This is the best indicator of long-term nutritional status in the pediatric population.
• Low weight for the age indicates acute or chronic malnutrition. It does not differentiate between wasting and stunting. Hence, it has limited clinical significance.
Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) is used for the screening of wasting in children between 6   months to 5 years. In children aged 6 months to 5 years, MUAC &lt;11.5cm is considered as severe malnutrition.",5642-3592.PNG,D,5642-3592.PNG;5668-3601-1.png;5644-3593.PNG
