Question 2,A 12-year-old boy with type 1 diabetes mellitus presents with unconsciousness. His urine is subjected to a test and the results are shown below. what is the test done?,"a) seliwanoff's test- Fructose
b) Benedict's test- Reducing sugars
c) Fouchet's test- Bilirubin
d) Rothera's test- ketone bodies","The given clinical scenario points towards a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis. Rothera’s test as shown in the image is a specific test used for the determination of ketone bodies in the urine.
Type I diabetes mellitus is a low insulin state. There is an increased conversion of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA which in turn leads to increased ketone body production. The presence of ketosis can be established by the detection of ketone bodies in urine by Rothera's test.
The test involves the saturation of 5 mL of urine with solid ammonium sulfate. This is followed by the addition of a few drops of freshly prepared sodium nitroprusside followed by 2 mL of liquor ammonia along the sides of the test tube. The development of a purple ring indicates the presence of ketone bodies in urine. strip tests based on the same principle are also available.
other options-
option A: seliwanoff's test will distinguish glucose and fructose. The reagent is resorcinol in HCl. 3 ml of the reagent and o.5 ml of urine are heated for 3o seconds up to a boiling point. A red color indicates the presence of fructose.
option B: Benedict's test is a test commonly used in the follow-up of diabetics for the detection of glucose in urine (glucosuria). It uses Benedict's reagent containing sodium carbonate, copper sulfate, and sodium citrate. Reducing sugars (containing a free aldehyde/ keto group) will reduce Benedict's reagent. Examples include glucose, fructose, and lactose. The test is a semi-quantitative test. The blue color indicates no reducing sugar.
option C: Fouchet's test is used for detecting the presence of bile pigments in urine. Here, urine is heated with barium sulfate, which adsorbs bilirubin. Ferric chloride is added, which oxidizes the adsorbed bilirubin to biliverdin which produces a green color. principle for all tests to detect bile pigments: oxidizing agents readily oxidize bilirubin to biliverdin to form a green color.",903-694.PNG,D,

b) 1, 3, 2, 4, 5
c) 1, 2 , 3, 5, 4
d) 2, 1, 3, 4, 5","The correct order of steps of karyotyping is as follows:
• collect cells by peripheral vein using a heparin syringe.
• culture in phytohaemoagglutinin.
• Incubation at 37 degrees c for 3 days.
• Harvest with colchicine.
• Routine staining with Giemsa
karyotyping is the process by which chromosomes are isolated, stained, and examined to find chromosomal anomalies. It is used in prenatal diagnosis, investigation of repeat pregnancy loss, investigation of children and adults suspected of having a chromosomal disorder, and subtyping of lymphomas and leukemias for the purpose of exact diagnosis, giving a prognosis, and treatment.
various techniques are used in karyotyping to study chromosomes. staining with various compounds produces various results and helps us to understand the chromosomes better.
common techniques used are:
• Q banding - fluorescence staining with quinacrine mustard
• G banding - Giemsa staining after partial denaturation of chromatin
• R banding - reverse Giemsa staining. In this, the light and dark areas are reversed
• c banding - staining of heterochromatin with silver salts
• T banding - staining the telomeres of chromosomes

Question 5,"A patient came with complaints of muscle weakness to the OpD. The doctor found that he has cardiomyopathy and diagnosed him to be a case of Barth syndrome, where the patient has mitochondrial dysfunction. what is the defect in this patient?","a) Cephalin
b) Cardiolipin
c) Lecithin
d) Lysolecithin","Decreased cardiolipin or alteration in its metabolism results in mitochondrial dysfunction seen in Barth syndrome (cardio skeletal myopathy) which is characterized by an enlarged and weakened heart (dilated cardiomyopathy ), weakness in muscles used for movement (skeletal myopathy), recurrent infections due to small numbers of white blood cells (neutropenia), and short stature.
Diphosphatidyl glycerol, also called cardiolipin, is the phospholipid found only in the mitochondria. Cardiolipin, which is a phospholipid with antigenic properties, is responsible for the false-positive VDRL test.
It is an important component of the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it is essential for the following:
• optimal function of numerous mitochondrial enzymes that are involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism.
• Maintenance of the structure of the mitochondrial membrane.
other options-
option A: phosphatidylethanolamine, also called cephalin, is found in the cell membranes of nervous tissue, particularly in the brain.
option C: Defect in the synthesis of dipalmitoyl lecithin leads to Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), also known as hyaline membrane disease.
option D: Lysolecithin is obtained by removing one fatty acid from lecithin. oxidized lysolecithin is associated with atherosclerosis.",,B,912-697.PNG
Question 6,"In pompe's disease, the enzyme deficient is?","a) Lactic acid dehydrogenase
b) phosphofructokinase
c) Muscle glycogen phosphorylase
d) Lysosomal alpha glucosidase","pompe's disease results from a deficiency in the enzyme lysosomal alpha-glucosidase.
pompe's disease is a type II glycogen storage disorder that results from a deficiency in the enzyme acid maltase/ lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase. It is a rapidly progressive disorder that results in hypotonia and hepatosplenomegaly. Myocardial involvement helps to distinguish it from other similar glycogen storage disorders.
Hepatomegaly results from the ballooning of the lysosomes with glycogen. This creates a characteristic lacy cytoplasmic pattern. Cardiac and skeletal muscles will show enlargement with clear spaces in the cells, representing glycogen storage within the lysosomes. This disease classically has a poor prognosis, but enzyme replacement has helped to prolong survival in recent times.
A muscle biopsy with enlarged glycogen-containing vacuoles can be seen in the image below:
other options:
option A: Lactic acid dehydrogenase deficiency is not associated with any disorder.
option B: Tarui's disease is characterized by a deficiency of muscle and erythrocyte phosphofructokinase 1. This results in abnormal glycogen metabolism and hence muscle cannot generate energy after exercise using glycogen reserves which leads to exercise intolerance.
option C: Muscle glycogen phosphorylase deficiency is seen in McArdle's disease (type V glycogen storage disorder). patients present with exercise-induced muscle cramping without elevated blood lactate levels which would normally be expected.",,D,IMAGE A
Question 7,The thermic effect is highest in ______.,"a) carbohydrates
b) proteins
c) Lipids
d) Independent of components","The thermic effect is highest in proteins.
specific dynamic allowance (previously called the thermic effect of food): This refers to the increased heat production or increased metabolic rate following the intake of food (diet-induced thermogenesis).
The values of SDA are
• 3o% for proteins: This means that out of every 1oo grams of proteins consumed, the energy available for doing useful work is 3o% less than the calculated value - i.e 3o% of the energy content in protein is used in its own metabolism.
• 15% for lipids, and
• 5% for carbohydrates.
Importance: It is a common experience that during hot weather following the consumption of a protein-rich meal, one feels hot and humid for a while. on the other hand, in cold weather, the same would provide a comfortable feeling.
The energy generated by the metabolism of the macronutrients is used for three energy-requiring processes that occur in the body:
• Resting metabolic rate
• Thermic effect of food (formerly termed specific dynamic action)
• physical activity",,B,
Question 8,which of the following statements are false about collagen?,"a) Most common fibrous protein
b) prolysyl and lysyl hydroxylase are involved in post translational modification
c) phenylalanine is the most abundant AA in its structure
d) Triple helix structure is important for its function","Glycine is the most abundant amino acid(AA) in collagen and not phenylalanine.
Collagen is the most abundant protein in the animal world. It has a triple helical structure, forming a right-handed superhelix. A striking characteristic of collagen is the occurrence of glycine residues at every third position.
proline and hydroxyproline confer rigidity on the collagen molecule. Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are formed by the post-translational hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues catalyzed by the enzyme prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase, whose cofactors are ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and α-ketoglutarate. Collagen is arranged in a quarter-staggered arrangement and further stabilized by covalent cross-links.",,C,
Question 9,ketone bodies are not utilized by the liver because it lacks:,"a) Thiokinase
b) Thiophorase
c) Thiolase
d) Thiotransferase","ketone bodies are not utilized in the liver because it lacks the enzyme thiophorase.
ketone bodies are synthesized in the liver mitochondria (by ketogenesis) and transported in the blood to the peripheral tissues. Here they are utilized by the following steps:
• β-hydroxybutyrate (the most predominant ketone body) is oxidized to acetoacetate by β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase producing NADH.
• Acetoacetate is then activated to acetoacetyl CoA by transferring a CoA molecule from succinyl CoA by succinyl CoA-acetoacetyl CoA transferase (thiophorase).
• Acetoacetyl CoA is cleaved into two acetyl CoA molecules by thiolase and oxidized into Co2 by the TCA cycle.
Thiokinase or Acyl CoA synthetase catalyzes the only energy-requiring step in fatty acid oxidation. In the presence of ATp and coenzyme A, thiokinase catalyzes the conversion of a fatty acid to acyl-CoA. Acyl-CoA is the active form of fatty acid. This step uses one high-energy phosphate and forms AMp and ppi.
when higher than normal ketone bodies are present in the blood or urine, it is called ketonemia or ketonuria, respectively. The overall condition is called ketosis. The metabolism of free fatty acids to produce ketone bodies is exaggerated in pathologic states such as starvation and diabetes mellitus, thus causing ketosis. The continued buffering and excretion of ketone bodies deplete the alkali reserve, causing ketoacidosis.",,B,
Question 10,which of the following methods can detect the alterations in DNA sequence?,"a) 1 and 3
b) 1, 2, and 3
c) 2, 3, and 4
d) 1, 2, and 4","The alterations in DNA sequence can be detected by restriction fragment length analysis and pyrosequencing.
Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLp) is also called cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CApS) assay. RFLp is a technique in which organisms may be differentiated by variations in their DNA sequence by restriction endonucleases. This technique involves cutting a particular region of DNA with known variability, with restriction enzymes, then separating the DNA fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis and determining the number of fragments and relative sizes.
pyrosequencing is a synthesis type of approach of DNA sequencing. This technique employs four enzymatic reactions in a single tube to monitor DNA synthesis. Nucleotides are incorporated into the reaction and pyrophosphate (ppi) is released. ppi triggers a series of reactions resulting in the production of light, which is proportional to the amount of DNA and number of incorporated nucleotides. The generated light is detected and recorded by a detector system in the form of a peak signal, which reflects the activity of all four enzymes in the reaction.
The practical applications of recombinant DNA technology include:
• Gene mapping using techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
• producing proteins such as:
• Interferons, tpA (tissue plasminogen activator)
• Insulin, growth hormone
• Hepatitis B vaccine
• Molecular analysis of disease, to detect gene variations and mutations.
• Restriction Fragment Length polymorphism (RFLp) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNp)
• Microsatellite DNA polymorphisms
• Gene therapy and bone marrow transplantation
Flow cytometry is a laser-based method that analyzes the cells and cell components based on the presence of certain cell surface molecules which are named as per cluster of differentiation (CD) nomenclature. It is very effective for the study of the immune system and its response to infectious diseases and cancer. It cannot detect the alterations in DNA sequence.
Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FIsH) is a technique where cells are stained with fluorescent stains. It uses DNA probes that recognize sequences specific to particular chromosomal regions. It cannot detect the alterations in DNA sequence. FIsH can be performed on prenatal samples, peripheral blood cells, touch preparations from cancer biopsies, and even fixed archival tissue sections. uses include :
• Numerical abnormalities of chromosomes e.g., aneuploidy.
• subtle microdeletions and rearrangements.
• complex translocations that are not demonstrable by routine karyotyping.
• Gene amplification of HER2 in breast cancer or NMYc amplification in neuroblastomas.",,A,916-698.PNG
Question 11,which anticoagulant present in the light blue vacutainer is used for plasma glucose estimation?,"a) sodium fluoride
b) Heparin
c) sodium Citrate
d) potassium oxalate","Light blue vacutainers contain the anticoagulant sodium citrate.
citrated plasma generated from whole blood is commonly utilized in laboratory testing for hemostasis. The recommended procedure involves the collection of specimens in tubes that are filled with a solution containing 3.2% sodium citrate (1o9 mM). The appropriate ratio for this collection is 9 parts blood to 1 part anticoagulant. The primary objective of citrate is to effectively eliminate calcium ions, which play a crucial role in the process of blood coagulation.
The following image shows color coding of vacutainers with the anticoagulant used and their practical uses:
vacutainer: Light grey, Light green, Light blue
Additive: sodiumfluorideand potassiu m oxalate; Lithium Heparin; sodiumcitrate
uses: Blood glucose estimation; Plasma testing; coagulation tests (APTT and prothrombin time)",,C,916-698.PNG
Question 12,which of the following is not involved in the repair of DNA following double-stranded breaks?,"a) ATM
b) BRCA1
c) MsH2
d) Ku7o","MSH2 is involved in mismatch repair and is not involved in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks as the repair involves the correction of a single mismatch base pair e.g. C to A, instead of T to A.
DNA mismatch repair proteins function as spell checkers during DNA replication by correcting the incorrect pairing. In HNPCC, the proofreading function of the mismatch repair systems (majorly MLH1 and MSH2) is lost, leading to the accumulation of errors throughout the genome. The genomes of these patients show microsatellite instability. HNPCC is associated with a high risk of colon cancer.
Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA pose a significant concern. Genetic recombination events can give rise to chromosomal translocation, chromosomal breakage, and ultimately cellular demise. Double-strand breaks (DSBs) have the potential to undergo repair through two distinct mechanisms: homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. Homologous recombination is observed in yeasts, whereas in mammals, non-homologous end joining predominates.
Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is a mechanism by which a group of proteins mediates the recognition, processing, and direct ligation of the ends of two DNA fragments where a double-strand break in DNA has occurred. This is in contrast to homologous repair (HR), another mechanism, where an undamaged homologous DNA template is required to replace an adjacent damaged one.
The type of repair depends on the phase of cell cycles:
other options:
option A: The protein known as ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) serves as a crucial kinase that triggers a wide range of cellular stress responses through its signalling activity. The activation of ATM is induced by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and oxidative stress, resulting in the phosphorylation of a wide range of target proteins. Recent advancements in molecular biology have brought to light the participation of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein in a range of cellular mechanisms triggered by DNA damage. These mechanisms encompass the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs), the halting of cell cycle progression through checkpoint activation, the initiation of programmed cell death (apoptosis), and the cessation of transcriptional activity. The compromised precision of repair resulting from the combinational failure of stress responses leads to heightened sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) cells.
option B: CtIP which is a DNA repair protein involved in Homologous Repair whose function is dependent on phosphorylation at serine 327 as well as the recruitment of BRCA 1.
option D: The Ku heterodimer, consisting of Ku7o and Ku8o subunits, plays a pivotal role in the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is responsible for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Ku protein mediates the binding of the damaged DNA fragment and orchestrates the recruitment of additional proteins to enable the subsequent processing and ligation of the broken DNA end.

Question 13,2-3 BpG binds to?,"a) Heme part of myoglobin
b) Globin part of Hemoglobin
c) Globin part of myoglobin
d) Heme part of Hemoglobin","2,3 bisphosphoglycerate binds to the globin chains ofthe hemoglobin while oxygen binds to the heme part of the hemoglobin.
A single unit of 2,3-BPG forms a complex with one tetrameric unit of deoxyhemoglobin within the central cavity of its four subunits. The centre pocket of this structure contains two -globin chains that are positively charged, such as histidine and lysine. Ionic bonds, also known as salt bridges, are established through the interaction between amino acids that carry a positive charge, specifically those found in globins, and phosphate groups that possess a negative charge, specifically those present in 2,3-BPG. The stabilization of deoxygenated haemoglobin (in its T-form) is achieved through the cross-linking of α-chains by the binding of 2,3-BPG. upon oxygenation of haemoglobin, the molecule 2,3-BPG is released from its binding site, resulting in the transformation of oxyhemoglobin into the R-form conformation.
A relaxed (R) configuration, exposes more o2 binding sites. The quaternary structure of haemoglobin determines its affinity for o2. In deoxyhemoglobin, the globin units are tightly bound in a tense (T) configuration, which reduces the affinity of the molecule for o2. when o2 is first bound, the bonds holding the globin units are released, producing a relaxed (R) configuration, which exposes more o2 binding sites. The net result is a 5oo-fold increase in o2. In tissues, these reactions are reversed, resulting in o2 dissociation.",,B,918-700.PNG
Question 14,which of the following is complementary to the active site of the enzyme?,"a) product
b) substrate
c) Allosteric activator
d) Transition site","The substrate is complementary to the active site of the enzyme.
The Lock and key concept was put forth by Emil Fischer. This model is the initial proposition aimed at elucidating the mechanism of an enzymatic catalytic process. Based on this concept, it can be inferred that the enzyme's structure or conformation exhibits a state of rigidity. The substrate effectively conforms to the binding site, which is now referred to as the active site, in a manner analogous to a key fitting precisely into its corresponding lock or a hand fitting snugly into a well-fitting glove. The active site of an enzyme can be described as a stiff and pre-configured template that selectively accommodates a certain substrate for binding.
The induced fit or koshland theory states that the active site does not possess a firm and pre-determined conformation. The emerging active site exhibits the fundamental characteristics of the substrate binding site. The substrate's contact with the enzyme elicits a conformational change in the enzyme, leading to the establishment of a robust binding site for the substrate. Moreover, as a result of induced fit, the enzyme undergoes conformational changes that lead to the repositioning of the specific amino acids involved in the formation of the active site, hence facilitating the catalytic process. The induced fit model has garnered substantial empirical support through X-ray diffraction studies. koshland's model additionally elucidates the mechanisms by which allosteric modulators and competitive inhibition exert their effects on enzymes.
The substrate strain theory states that the substrate experiences strain as a result of the conformational alteration generated by the enzyme. It is plausible that upon the binding of a substrate to the preexisting active site, the enzyme elicits a strain on the substrate. The presence of a stressed or strained substrate facilitates the generation of the desired product. The enzymatic action is believed to involve a combination of the induced fit model and substrate strain.
other options:
option A: The complementary active site of the enzyme binds to the substrate to form the product.
option C: The active site of the enzyme is not complementary to the allosteric activator. Allosteric sites are separate and specific sites on the enzyme that are modulated with allosteric effect modifiers and hence are complementary to them.
option D: The active site of the enzyme binds to the substrate which form a transitional state which is unstable and later dissociates to form a product.",,B,919-701.PNG
Question 15,cytochrome P45o monooxygenase utilises which of the following cofactors during the phase 1 reaction of detoxification of xenobiotics?,"a) FMN
b) NADPH
c) FAD
d) NAD","The microsomal cytochrome P45o system, located in the liver, facilitates the process of drug and foreign substance detoxification through hydroxylation processes that rely on the availability of NADPH.
Phase 1 reactions include oxidation, reduction, or hydrolytic reaction. CyPs- Cytochrome P family of enzymes play a major role in phase 1 reactions. Reactions carried out by phase 1 enzymes usually lead to the inactivation of a drug. The addition of functional groups does little to increase the water solubility of the drug but alters its biological properties.
The importance of NADPH is enumerated as follows:
• NADPH is needed for the reductive biosynthesis of fatty acids and steroids, hence HMP shunt is more active in lipogenesis tissues liKe adipose tissue and the liver.
• Along with Glutamate dehydrogenase helps in the synthesis of various amino acids.
• Maintaining reduced glutathione is critical for RBC membrane integrity. NADPH Keeps haemoglobin's ferrous iron (Fe2+) lowered to prevent methemoglobin (Fe3+) buildup.
• High concentrations of NADPH are also required to maintain the transparency ofthe lens.
The cytochromes are a class of proteins that possess a conjugated heme group. The latter is comprised of a porphyrin ring containing an iron atom. The heme group present in cytochromes exhibits distinct characteristics when compared to the heme group observed in the structures of haemoglobin and myoglobin. The heme iron within cytochromes undergoes a cyclic process of oxidation (Fe3+) and reduction (Fe2+), playing a crucial role in facilitating electron movement throughout the electron transport chain (ETC). This stands in opposition to the heme iron found in haemoglobin and myoglobin, which remains in the ferrous (Fe2+) form. The cytochromes were initially assigned the designations of a, b, and c based on the specific heme type they contained and their corresponding absorption spectra. subsequent discoveries led to the identification of additional cytochromes, including c1, b1, b2, a3, among others.
other options:
option A: Flavin adenine mononucleotide (FMN) is a phosphorylated form of riboflavin which functions as a cofactor for various enzymes. some of these include as a cofactor for blue-light photoreceptors and oxidoreductases.
option C: Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is nothing but phosphorylated riboflavin and is used in the electron transport chain and also is a cofactor for various enzymes. some of these include oxidative phosphorylation, DNA repair, beta-oxidation of fatty acids as well as amino acid catabolism.
option D: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) consists of the vitamin B3 (niacin) and also serves as a coenzyme for various enzymatic reactions in the body. some of these include oxidative phosphorylation (ATP production), DNA repair and intracellular calcium signalling.",,B,
Question 16,which biochemical cycle/process is used by monoclonal antibodies in hybridoma technology?,"a) TcA cycle
b) Glycolytic pathway
c) Pentose phosphate pathway
d) Purine salvage pathway","It is the purine salvage pathway that is utilized by monoclonal antibodies in hybridoma technology.
Monoclonal antibodies refer to the antibodies produced by a group of lymphocytes that produce antibodies against a single antigen. These antibodies are produced by hybridoma technology.
In this technology, the B-lymphocytes of mice spleen are immunized with an antigen to produce a specific antibody. These specific antibody-producing B lymphocytes are then fused with myeloma cells that can multiply indefinitely.
The myeloma cells are deficient in the hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) gene and do not produce immunoglobulins. Therefore, the resulting hybrid cell is producing antibodies against a single antigen indefinitely. These hybrid cells are cultured in a HAT medium (containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine) and the monoclonal antibodies are obtained. It is well-established that nucleotides present in DNA and RNA consist of purine and pyrimidine bases. The synthesis of these nucleotides can occur through either the De novo pathway or the salvage pathway. consequently, the inclusion of aminopterin in the HAT medium effectively inhibits the De novo pathway, thereby rendering the synthesis of purine dependent on the salvage pathway. However, it should be noted that the salvage pathway exclusively takes place in the presence of the enzymes HGPRT and thymidine kinase. The hybridoma cell is uniquely capable of proliferating on the HAT medium due to its distinct composition. specifically, the myeloma component of the hybridoma possesses the capacity for repetitive cellular division, while the plasma cell component contains the enzyme HGPRT. consequently, the hybridoma cells can sustain growth and viability over an extended period when cultivated on the HAT medium.
Hybridoma technology is a method for producing large numbers of identical antibodies (monoclonal antibodies).
Hybridomas are somatic cell hybrids produced by fusing the antibody-forming spleen cells with myeloma cells. The resultant hybrid thus has both the antibody-producing ability of the B-cell and the ability to multiply indefinitely of the myeloma.
The following are the steps involved in hybridoma technology:
• Mice are immunized with an antigen.
• After several weeks of immunization, blood samples are obtained from mice for measurement of serum antibodies.
• when the antibody titer is high enough, mice are commonly boosted by injecting antigen without adjuvant, intraperitoneally or intravenously.
• Then the mice are euthanized and their spleens removed for in vitro hybridoma cell production.
• Fusing antibody-producing spleen cells, which have a limited life span, with myeloma cells (derived from an immortal tumour of lymphocytes) results in a hybridoma that is capable of unlimited growth.
• The cells are cultured in a medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium) which allows only the fused cells to survive in culture.
• Monoclonal antibodies are then harvested. Applications of hybridoma technology
• Listing lymphocyte subpopulations
• Specific cell quantitative preparation
• As an immunosuppressant in therapeutic settings
• Blood component nephelometric assays
• ELISA testing
• Quantitative purification of antigens.
• common therapeutic applications for monoclonal antibodies",,D,922-702.PNG
Question 17,Glycogen phosphorylase requires which of the following for its activation?,"a) Insulin
b) Glucose 6 phosphate
c) ca2+
d) cAMP independent protein kinase","Glycogen phosphorylase requires the presence of calcium to attain its fully activated state.
Glycogen phosphorylase is an enzyme required in glycogenolysis.
In the muscle: During muscle contraction → ca++ is released → ca++ binds to calmodulin forming ca++-calmodulin complex → activates phosphorylase kinase from b form (inactive form) without phosphorylation → significant ca++ is required to activate glycogen phosphorylase.
Hormonal regulation of glycogenolysis:
Glucagon (in liver) and epinephrine (in liver and muscle) acts via GPcR to activate adenylyl cyclase to catalyse synthesis of cAMP. cAMP dependent protein kinase activates phosphorylase kinase from inactive(b) to active(a) form, which in turn activates glycogen phosphorylase to active(a) form, hence leading to increased glycogenolysis. (option D)
option A: Insulin is a known inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase which dephosphorylates the glycogen phosphorylase enzyme thus rendering it inactive.
option B: Glucose 6 phosphate is also an inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase which dephosphorylates it thus rendering it inactive.
The regulation of glycogen phosphorylase is shown in the image below:",,C,923-703.PNG
