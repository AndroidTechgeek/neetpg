Q1,A 15-year-old girl presents with itchy lesions on her arm as shown. Her family history is positive for asthma. what could be the most probable diagnosis?,"a)seborrhoeic dermatitis
b)Atopic dermatitis
c)Allergic contact dermatitis
d)Erysipelas","The clinical scenario depicting pruritic lesions at a flexural site along with a family history of
atopy (asthma) is suggestive of atopic dermatitis (AD) or atopic eczema (AE). The scratch
marks and excoriations shown in the image are due to pruritis, which is the hallmark feature of



AD.
AD is a chronic relapsing inflammatory condition. It presents with erythematous macules,
papules and vesicles that often start in early childhood, usually less than 2 years old. The lesions later become excoriated and lichenified. It is frequently associated with dryness of the skin
and secondary infections. In infancy, the lesions initially appear on face (sparing the napkin area) and later on extensor aspect of knees and elbows as the child starts crawling. In later childhood     and in adults, the principal site of involvement is flexures.
The filaggrin monomers in keratinocytes in the epidermis bind and aggregate keratin bundles and intermediate filaments to form the epidermal barrier. Any damage/dysfunction of this barrier is     associated with an increased risk of developing AD. Damage to this barrier can be due to
environmental factors (detergents, hard water, uv light) or local inflammatory
reactions. Dysfunction of the barrier can be due to genetic mutation of the FLG gene leading to reduced filaggrin production or local immunomodulatory effects leading to reduced filaggrin
expression.
other options:
option A: seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by
erythema, pruritus, scaling, flaking, or crusting of the skin. It is often associated with Malasezzia fungal infection. A milder form of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp is commonly known as
dandruff.


option C: Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is an inflammatory condition caused due to a delayed hypersensitivity reaction (Type 4 hypersensitivity) to a specific allergen that comes into direct
contact with the skin.patients usually present with pruritus, erythema, swelling,
papules, and papulovesicles. some common allergens include nickel (found in artificial jewelry),  ppD/para phenylene diamine (in hair dye), chromate (in cement), rubber or latex, cosmetics, etc. patch test (image below) is used for the diagnosis of ACD.





option D: Erysipelas is a bacterial skin infection caused by streptococcus pyogenes (Group A
streptococcus) characterized by raised, erythematous sharply demarcated rapidly spreading skin lesions, along with systemic symptoms like fever and chills. The skin may also have a peau
d'orange or orange peel-like appearance.",3577-2248.PNG,B,3580-2250.PNG;3558-2231.PNG;3581-2251.PNG
Q2,which of the following is a primary skin lesion?,"a)crust
b)Atrophy
c)purpura
d)Induration","purpura is a primary skin lesion. crust, atrophy, and induration are secondary lesions.
It is a condition with red or purple discolored spots on the skin that do not blanch on applying pressure. The spots are caused by bleeding underneath the skin. It is seen:
• vasculitis
• Thrombocytopenia



• vitamin C deficiency


option A: Crusts or scabs consist of dried-up discharge from the lesions.


option B: Atrophy refers to loss of tissue. There may be fine wrinkling and increased translucency if the process is superficial.
option D: Induration refers to dermal thickening that clinically presents as skin that feels thicker and firmer than normal on palpation.",,C,3582-2253.PNG;3582-2252.PNG
Q3,which of the following statements is false regarding scleredema?,"a)The dermis is 3一4 times thicker than normal
b)Erythema and peau d’orange appearance of the skin can be seen
c)can occur in association with diabetes
d)Associated with sclerodactyly or Raynauds phenomenon","scleredema is not associated with sclerodactyly or Raynauds phenomenon. scleredema
and scleroderma are different entities. In contrast to systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), scleredema is not associated with sclerodactyly, Raynaud phenomenon, nail fold capillary changes, or serum



autoantibodies.
In scleredema, the dermis is 3–4 times thicker than normal due to an increase in type 1 collagen synthesis by dysfunctional fibroblast. However, fibroblast proliferation is not seen.
Erythema and a peau d’orange appearance of the skin are commonly observed. The hands and feet are characteristically spared.
Diabetic scleredema is the most common type. In diabetic scleredema, the accumulation of
collagen may be due to irreversible non■enzymatic glycosylation of collagen and resistance to degradation by collagenase. It can also occur post-streptococcal infections.",,D,
Q4,Identify the pigmentation abnormality in the image shown below.,"a)Mongolian spot
b)Naevus of Ito
c)congenital melanocytic naevus
d)Beckerls naevus","The given image showing hyperpigmented lesion on shoulder associated with hypertrichosis is suggestive of Becker's naevus.
It is an epidermal melanocytic naevus with aggregation of melanocyte clusters in the epidermis. It is often hairy. The onset is around adolescence when there is an increased sensitivity to androgens especially in the distribution of outer arms, scapular area and chest.
A triad of features can be seen:
• Hyperpigmentation
• Hypertrichosis
• Acne
option A: Mongolian spots are slate blue areas in the lumbosacral region that spontaneously regress before puberty.


option B: Naevus of Ito is unilateral hyperpigmentation in the acromioclavicular distribution. It is not known to have hypertrichosis or acne.





option c: congenital melanocytic nevi are common moles that become raised and have a
cerebriform appearance and can be hairy. They can occur anywhere. The onset is at birth or soon after birth",3578-2249.PNG,D,3583-2254.PNG;3584-2256.PNG;3584-2255.PNG
Q5,what is the most common causative organism for verruca vulgaris?,"a)Human papillomavirus-1
b)Human papillomavirus-3
c)Human papillomavirus-1o
d)Human papillomavirus-2","Verruca vulgaris or common wart is most commonly caused by human papillomavirus-2 (HPV-2) but is also related to types 1, 4, 27, and 57.
common warts are usually asymptomatic. They show acanthosis, hyperkeratosis,
and papillomatosis and present as firm papules with a rough horny surface. The most commonly affected sites are on the backs of the hands and fingers, and, in children on the
knees. Pseudo-koebner phenomenon may be observed.



Treatment is usually with topical agents such as salicylic acid, caustics, glutaraldehyde, formalin, or with laser, cryotherapy, surgical removal.

Q6,cutis marmorata occurs due to ______,"a)Humidity
b)Exposure to hot temperature
c)An adverse reaction to drugs","cutis marmorata refers to the pinkish-blue mottled or marbled appearance when subjected to cold temperatures.
It is seen throughout infancy and in 5o% of children. It is caused by simultaneous dilation and contraction of the superficial capillaries. Rewarming restores the skin to normal. This is a
physiological finding and requires no treatment. However, persistent cutis marmorata may be seen in trisomies 18 and 21.
Note: cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita is a distinct vascular developmental disorder and is easily distinguished as it is fixed (it does not disappear on rewarming), and it may be associated with a variety of other anomalies such as limb growth or renal anomalies.",,A,3586-2258.PNG
Q7,varicella-zoster virus remains dormant in the:,"a)Medulla oblongata
b)Dorsal root ganglion
c)skin
d)ventral root","varicella-zoster virus (vzv) is a human herpesvirus that causes varicella (chickenpox) as a
primary infection and then remains in a latent form in the dorsal root ganglia for a variable period after which it can reactivate to cause herpes zoster (shingles).",,B,
