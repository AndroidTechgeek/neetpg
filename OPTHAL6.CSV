Q1,which of the following would be prescribed for simple myopic astigmatism?,"a)+1.oo DS
b)-1.oo DC X 18o degree
c)-1.oo DS
d)-1.oo DS -1.oo DC X 18o degree","Among the above options, -1.oo DC × 18o degrees is the correct prescription for simple myopic astigmatism (SMA).
There are 3 components for prescription of glasses.
1. The first number is the refractive power of the spherical component. It is represented as convex (+) or concave (-) dioptre sphere (DS).
2. The second number denotes the power of the cylinder, represented as convex (+) or concave (-)
dioptre cylinder (DC).
3. The above two components are followed by an x representing the axis (orientation) of the cylinder.






In the most common type of SMA - with-the-rule astigmatism - meridian A (represented by 9o   degrees) is more curved than meridian B (represented by 18o degrees). The light rays refracting from B focus on the retina, whereas those refracting from A focus in front of the retina.
To correct this error, a negative cylindrical lens (DC) is used to focus the myopic rays of meridian A on the retina. This correction needs to occur at 9o degrees (meridian A). The axis of a
cylindrical lens is perpendicular to the required correction and thus, the spectacles will have an axis of 18o degrees.
There is no spherical refractive error since the light rays from meridian B lies on the retina. Thus DS is o.",,B,3001-1825.PNG;3001-1826.PNG
Q2,Treatment of ptosis caused by Horner’s syndrome is:,"a)Levator resection
b)Frontalis sling
c)Fasanella servat operation
d)None of the above","Fasanella servat operation is done for cases of mild ptosis (1.5-2 mm) with retained levator palpabrae superioris muscle function as seen in Horner s syndrome.
Ptosis in Horner's syndrome is due to the loss of sympathetic supply to the muller's muscle of the lid and not due to levator muscle palsy. Fasanella servat operation is not done in patients with
severe ptosis and poor levtaor function.
option A:Levator resection is performed for moderate and severe grades of ptosis but with
retained levator function. This operation is contraindicated in patients with poor levator function.
option B: Frontalis sling also known as Brow suspension is done in patients with severe ptosis
with poor or absent levator muscle function. Here, the lid is anchored to the frontalis muscle via a sling.
surgical treatment of various types of ptosis

surgery	Amount of ptosis that can be treated	Indications
Fasanella servat	< 2 mm -mild ptosis	Horner syndrome
Levator Resection   Anterior approach	Any amount (but with retaine d levator function)	Larger resection in ptosis
Levator resection    conjuncti val approach	Any amount (but with retaine d levator function)	Moderate resection in ptosis
Levator resection with apone urotic reinsertion	Any amount (but with retaine d levator function)	Acquired ptosis

Q3,which of the following is not true about retinitis pigmentosa?,"a)Retinal pigmentation
b)pale waxy disc
c)Narrowing of vessels
d)ERG – normal","Electroretinogram (ERG) is abnormal in retinitis pigmentosa (RP).
ERG is a sensitive diagnostic test in retinitis pigmentosa that shows reduced scotopic, subnormal responses in early disease and becomes completely extinguished in advanced disease.
Electroocoulogram (EoG) is also abnormal in retinitis pigmentosa.
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited or acquired pigmentatory retinal dystrophy affecting the rods more than the cones. The earliest manifestation is worsening of night blindness and delayed  adaptation which gradually progresses to tunnel vision and ultimately loss of central vision.
The classic triad of findings in RP comprises:
Bone-spicule retinal pigmentation
Arteriolar attenuation
waxy  disc pallor

Q4,A 45-year-old patient comes with complaints of progressive weakness as the day progresses. He is found to have antibodies against nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. which is the most   common ocular finding in this disease?,"a)Diplopia
b)Lagophthalmos
c)Exophthalmos
d)ptosis","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of myasthenia gravis and ptosis is the most common ocular feature of the disease.
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction most
commonly caused by anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. The disorder is characterized by weakness and fatigability of skeletal muscles where the weakness increases during repeated   use and may improve following rest.
ptosis and diplopia are common initial complaints due to early involvement of the lids and
extraocular muscles (EOMs). Of them, ptosis is a more common manifestation than diplopia.
ptosis in myasthenia gravis is insidious, bilateral, and frequently asymmetrical.
Investigations of myasthenia gravis include:
• Ice pack test -This tests for a transient improvement of the ptotic eyelid on placing an ice pack for 2 minutes, as  the cold inhibits the breakdown of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase.
• Tensilon (Edrophonium) test - This tests for a transient improvement in the weakness on administration of a short-acting anticholinesterase such as edrophonium.
• Antibody testing - for Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies, MuSK protein antibodies helps support a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis.",,D,
Q5,"A patient with a history of trauma, presented with diplopia, epistaxis, and restricted eye movements. Looking at the CT image given below, what will be your diagnosis?","a)Le- fort fracture
b)Fracture maxilla
c)Fracture zygomatic
d)Blow out fracture","The given clinical scenario plus the supportive CT image showing the ""hanging drop sign"" is suggestive of a blowout fracture of the orbital wall.
Blow-out fractures are isolated comminunited fractures caused from direct trauma to the orbit
that results in a backward displacement of the eyeball and an increase in the intraorbital pressure.



This causes a fracture at the weakest point of the orbital wall which is usually the posteromedial portion of the maxillary bone in the orbital floor. The second most common site for orbital
blowout fracture is the medial wall of the orbit.
The patient with blow out fracture usually presents with immediate periorbital edema and blood extravasation in and around the orbit. proptosis of the eyeball secondary to orbital edema or
hemorrhage with paresthesia along the infraorbital nerve are also very common.
Imaging by a plain x-ray in water's view or by CT demonstrates depression of bony fragments and orbital contents herniating through the orbital floor into the maxillary antrum. This is called as
the ""hanging drop sign"" or ""tear drop sign"".
Definitive treatment is by surgical repair 1o-14 days after injury with initial supportive
management with analgesics and antibiotics.

Q6,what is the likely diagnosis from the image given below?,"a)pinguecula
b)Concretions
c)pterygium
d)Bitots spots","The likely diagnosis, based on the above image, is pterygium.
pterygium is a subconjunctival fibrovascular tissue encroaching the cornea. It is a degenerative condition of the sub-conjunctival tissue and is never inflammatory. It occurs due to exposure     to Uv-B radiation and the most common site is the nasal.
It is made up of three parts, ""cap"" (an avascular halo-like zone at the advancing edge), a head, and a body.
Clinical features:
• Astigmatism with the rule - most common finding
• stocker's line - deposition of iron on the advancing edge
• Fuchs islets - small, discrete, whitish flecks consisting of clusters of pterygial epithelial cells, often present at the advancing edge.
The differential diagnosis is pseudo pterygium.
The treatment for pterygium is usually excision. To prevent a recurrence, mitomycin C or 5 fluorouracil is used. other methods:
• Auto-grafting- Conjunctival limbal autograft (CLAG) from the superior limbal conjunctiva is the best method.
• Bare sclera technique- high recurrence rate of 3o to 8o%.
• pERFECT surgery- zero rates of recurrence. (pERFECT stands for pterygium Extended Removal Followed by Extended Conjunctival Transplant)

Q7,which of the following statements is false regarding accommodative esotropia?,"a)It is the most common type of squint.
b)Miotics are used as the treatment strategy in the high AC/A ratio
c)It is associated with high myopia.
d)Refractive type can be fully corrected by use of spectacles.","Accommodative esotropia is associated with a high degree of hypermetropia (+4 to +7 D).
Accommodative esotropia is the most common type of squint. Typically presents around 2 to 3 years of age.
Types:
• Refractive
• Associated with high hypermetropia
• Fully correctable by spectacles
• Non-refractive type
• Abnormal accommodative convergence/accommodation (AC/A) ratio
• Fully corrected by bifocal glasses
• Miotics useful in cases where glasses are unsuitable
• Echothiophate causes iris cyst
• prevention of iris cysts- phenylephrine drops
• Mixed type
The accommodative convergence/accommodation (AC/A) ratio is defined as the amount of convergence measured in prism diopters per unit (diopter) change in accommodation.

Q9,"A 5o-year-old male presented with progressive blurred vision, photophobia, and eye pain. on examination, there was conjunctival redness, a mid-dilated pupil, and a shallow anterior
chamber in the right eye. He has been treated both medically and surgically for the condition but showed no improvement. The following procedure incorporates a device to aid drainage.  Identify the device.","a)Ex-press™ implant
b)Ahmed glaucoma valve
c)Molteno implant
d)Baerveldt implant","The clinical vignette points to a diagnosis of glaucoma not responsive to medical treatment and trabeculectomy and the device used is an ex-press™ glaucoma implant (mini shunt).
It is a form of minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) to increase aqueous drainage.



Ex-pREss glaucoma implant is a small stainless steel device. It is inserted under a scleral flap
during a modified trabeculectomy. complications such as hypotony are lower than with standard trabeculectomy.
Glaucoma drainage devices are devices that allow aqueous outflow by establishing communication between the anterior chamber and sub-Tennon's space/sub-conjunctival space. while these
devices were traditionally reserved for high-risk patients, or after trabeculectomy had failed, they are becoming increasingly popular.
The commonly used devices are as follows:
1. shunts using episcleral explants
• Ahmed glaucoma valve: silicone
• Molteno implant - polypropylene plate and silicone plate
• Baerveldt implant - silicone
2. Mini-shunts
• Ex-press™ Mini-shunt: stainless steel
• istent® - Titanium",3018-1839.PNG,A,
Q10,Identify the instrument.,"a)Maddox wing
b)Maddox glass
c)Maddox rod
d)phoropter","The above instrument is a Maddox rod.
Maddox Rod Test
A Maddox rod is a specially constructed device, consisting of a series of parallel cylinders, that
converts a point source of light into a line image. It can be used to test for horizontal and vertical deviations, and when used in conjunction with another Maddox rod, for cyclo deviations.
A patient is asked to fix on a point light in the center of Maddox tangent scale placed 6 meters away. A Maddox rod is placed in front of one eye with the axis of the rod parallel to the axis of deviation. The patient will see a point light with one eye and a red line with the other. Due to
dissimilar images of the two eyes, fusion is broken and heterophoria becomes manifest. The
number on the Maddox tangent scale where the red line falls will be the amount of heterophoria in degrees.",3019-1841.PNG,C,3028-1845.PNG;3028-1844.PNG;3029-1846.PNG;3028-1843.PNG
