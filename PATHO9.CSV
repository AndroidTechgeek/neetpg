Q1,"A 7o-year-old patient presented with cough, fatiguability, and weight loss. He was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma (scc) on bronchoscopy. The resected specimen had a hilar
lymph node that was 1cm in size and showed a black pigment. what is the black pigment likely to be?","a)Anthracotic pigment
b)Melanin
c)Lipochrome
d)Hemosiderin","The black-colored pigment in the hilar lymph node of the resected bronchoscopic specimen is likely to be an anthracotic pigment.
The black color is due to the deposition of carbon particles. The inhaled carbon particles are engulfed by the lung macrophages and then transported to the hilar lymph nodes.
This accumulates and causes the blackening of the lung tissues or anthracosis.
It is commonly seen in people who work in environments where there is high air pollution with    carbon particles, such as coal mines. It is also the most common exogenous pigment found in the human body as a result of air pollution in urban areas. The aggregates ofthe carbon dust may
induce fibroblastic reaction or emphysema that may lead to a condition called coal worker's pneumoconiosis.
The following image shows anthracosis with deposition of black carbon particles, within the cytoplasm of macrophages.






option B: Melanin is brown-black in color which occurs as a result of oxidation of tyrosine in melanocytes, as shown in the following histopathology of a lymph node.





option C: Lipochrome or lipofuscin (brown lipid) is seen as a yellow-brown pigment in
histopathological sections of the liver and heart of normal aging patients, patients with severe malnutrition, and cancer cachexia. It is derived through lipid peroxidation and indicates free   radical injury and lipid peroxidation. The following image shows a cardiac myocyte with fine   yellow-brown lipofuscin granules in the perinuclear region.






option D: Hemosiderin is a hemoglobin-derived golden-yellow colored pigment seen in conditions associated with iron overload such as hemochromatosis. The following image shows extensive
intra-alveolar hemosiderin deposition following pulmonary hemorrhage.",,A,2066-1331.PNG;2066-1330.PNG;2067-1333.PNG;2067-1332.PNG;2068-1335.PNG;2068-1334.PNG
Q2,"A 34-year-old female patient presented to the outpatient department with migratory arthritis  and examination revealed a pan-systolic murmur. An echocardiography was performed which was suggestive of mitral regurgitation. A biopsy specimen was obtained and the image is
provided below. what is the most likely lesion shown in the histopathology slide?","a)Aschoff's bodies
b)Epithelioid granuloma
c)Granulomatous vasculitis
d)Granuloma inguinale","The given clinical findings of migratory arthritis, pan-systolic murmur, and mitral regurgitation
are suggestive of acute rheumatic fever. The most likely lesion shown in the histopathological slide is Aschoff's bodies.
Aschoff's bodies are the lesions found in the heart during acute rheumatic fever. They are
composed of foci ofT lymphocytes, occasional plasma cells, and plump-activated macrophages
called Anitschkow cells. Anitschkow cells have abundant cytoplasm and central round-to-ovoid
nuclei with chromatin that is centrally condensed into a slender, wavy ribbon. Hence they are also



called caterpillar cells.
During acute rheumatic fever, Aschoff bodies may be found in any of the three layers of the heart that results in pericarditis, myocarditis, or endocarditis.
Fibrinoid necrosis can occur due to inflammation of the endocardium and the left-sided valves.
over these areas of necrosis, small vegetations can be seen along the lines of closure, called
verrucae. Irregular thickenings called MacCallum plaques can be present In the subendocardium.
In chronic RHD, the mitral valve shows leaflet thickening, commissural fusion and shortening,   and thickening and fusion of the tendinous cords. Calcification and fibrous bridging of the valve can lead to narrowing the mitral orifice and giving it a fish mouth appearance.",2060-1329.PNG,A,2039-1303.PNG
Q3,A 3o-year-old male complained of fatigue for the past 1 year. Examination revealed massive  splenomegaly. His blood workup shows the following findings. which of the following is the most sensitive investigation in this case?,"a)Immunophenotyping
b)LAP score
c)FISH and PCR
d)Flow cytometry","The clinical presentation with fatigue, splenomegaly, and the peripheral blood smear findings are suggestive of chronic myelogenous leukemia(CML). The BCR-ABL gene which is specific for CML is detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) or polymerase chain reaction(PCR) based   tests.
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder with the peak incidence in the fifth to sixth decade of life. The chimeric BCR-ABL gene is created by a reciprocal
(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation(Philadelphia chromosome). This BCR-ABL gene distinguishes CML    from other myeloproliferative disorders and is detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Clinical features:
Mild to moderate anemia and hypermetabolism, fatigability, weakness, weight loss, and anorexia. Dragging sensation in the abdomen caused by splenomegaly, or the acute onset of left upper
quadrant pain due to splenic infarction. The spleen is often greatly enlarged as a result of
extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis. Extramedullary hematopoiesis can also produce mild hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy.



peripheral blood:
• Leukocytosis with leukocyte count, often exceeding 1oo,ooo cells/mm3, which consists   predominantly of neutrophils, band forms, metamyelocytes, myelocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.
• Blasts are usually less than 1o% of the circulating cells.
• platelet count is usually increased
Bone Marrow:
• Markedly hypercellular marrow because of massively increased numbers of maturing
granulocytic precursors. There is usually an elevated proportion of eosinophils and basophils.
• There is also an increase in megakaryocytes and usually include small, dysplastic forms and    erythroid progenitors are present in normal or mildly decreased numbers. Typically there is an increased reticulin deposition, but overt marrow fibrosis is rare early in the course.
• sea-blue histiocytes - These are scattered macrophages with abundant wrinkled,green-blue cytoplasm.
other options:
Immunophenotyping and flow cytometry: Flow cytometry refers to the measurement of cellular
antigens as they flow in a fluid stream. Immunophenotyping is employed using labeled antibodies against specific epitopes of cellular antigens. The technique that is usually used in
immunophenotyping is flow cytometry. It has a limited role in the diagnosis of CML. It is mainly used in identifying CML blast transformation.
LAp score: Leucocyte alkaline phosphatase(LAp) score is decreased in cases of CML. It is only  a first-line test in the diagnosis of CML and the diagnosis needs to be confirmed by other tests including bone marrow biopsy, molecular diagnostics, and cytogenetic analysis.",,C,
Q4,"A girl presents with short stature, webbed neck, thick calves, shield-shaped chest, swelling of the ankle, and increased carrying angle. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Turner syndrome
b)Down syndrome
c)Patau syndrome
d)Edward syndrome","The clinical presentation of short stature, webbed neck, thick calves, shield-shaped chest, swelling of the ankle, and increased carrying angle is suggestive of Turner syndrome.
Turner syndrome occurs due to complete or partial monosomy ofX-chromosomes. It produces hypogonadism in phenotypic females. It is the most common sex chromosome abnormality in   females.
Important features associated with Turner's syndrome:
• short stature
• webbing of neck
• Broad chest and widely spaced nipples
• Cubitus valgus
• streak ovaries, infertility, amenorrhea

Q5,"A patient with occupational exposure to benzene presents with repeated infections, easy   fatigability, weight loss, and evening rise of temperature. This occupational exposure will predispose him to which of the following cancers?","a)Leukemia
b)Lung cancer
c)Bladder cancer
d)Skin cancer","occupational exposure to benzene predisposes to leukemia. The given clinical history of repeated infections, easy fatigability, weight loss, and evening rise of temperature with benzene exposure    points towards a diagnosis of leukemia.
Benzene is oxidized to an epoxide through hepatic Cyp2E1. The epoxide and other metabolites   disrupt progenitor cell differentiation in the bone marrow and lead to marrow aplasia and acute myeloid leukemia.
Acute myeloid leukemia is a tumor of hematopoietic progenitors caused by acquired oncogenic
mutations that impede differentiation. This leads to the accumulation of immature myeloid blasts in the marrow. The replacement of the marrow with blasts produces marrow failure
and complications related to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia.
other options:
option B: Exposure to arsenic and its compounds, asbestos, beryllium and its compounds,
chromium compounds, nickel compounds, radon, and its decay products can cause lung cancer.
option C: Exposure to aryl amines, particularly 2-naphthylamine and related compounds, cyclophosphamide, cigarette smoking, irradiation can cause bladder cancer.
option D: Exposure to Uv rays, arsenic, and its compounds can cause skin cancer.",,A,
Q6,"In iron deficiency anemia, all of the following is increased except","a)Transferrin saturation
b)RBc protoporphyrin
c)Total iron binding capacity
d)Ferritin soluble receptors","Transferrin saturation is decreased in iron deficiency anemia.
Clinical presentation may include fatigue, pallor, reduced exercise capacity. Cheilosis (fissures at the corners of the mouth) and koilonychia (spooning of the fingernails) are signs of advanced
tissue iron deficiency.
Laboratory findings are:
• Reduced hemoglobin and hematocrit values.
• hypochromia, microcytosis, and poikilocytosis.
• serum iron and ferritin levels are low.
• The total plasma iron-binding capacity that reflects the elevated transferrin levels is high.
• Low serum iron with increased iron-binding capacity results in a reduction of transferrin saturation to below 15%.
• RBC protoporphyrin levels are increased. protoporphyrin is an intermediate in the heme  synthesis pathway. Under conditions in which heme synthesis is impaired, protoporphyrin



accumulates within the red cell.
• Bone marrow reveals a mild to moderate increase in erythroid progenitors. The absence of stainable iron in macrophages is a diagnostically significant finding.

Q7,which of the following is a poor prognostic marker of multiple myeloma?,"a)β-2 microglobulin
b)calcium levels
c)serum creatinine
d)protein levels","β-2 microglobulin is a poor prognostic marker of multiple myeloma.
Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell neoplasm commonly associated with lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, renal failure, and acquired immune abnormalities.
poor prognostic factors for multiple myeloma:
• serum β2-microglobulin. It is the single most powerful predictor



• Deletion of 17pITp53 sequences and the translocations t(14;16) and t(14;2o)
• polyclonal serum Immunoglobulins
• Elevated lactate dehydrogenase
• High C-reactive protein
• Increased plasma cell proliferative activity
• High degree of bone marrow replacement
• presence of plasmablastic morphology
• Elevated serum soluble receptor for IL6
Multiple myeloma usually presents as destructive plasma cell tumors involving the axial skeleton. The bones most commonly affected in descending order of frequency are the vertebral column,
ribs, skull, pelvis, femur, clavicle, and scapula.
Radiographically, bone lesions appear as punched-out defects, usually 1 to 4 cm in diameter, and consist of soft, gelatinous, red tumor masses.
Radiograph of the skull showing punched out lesions:


Morphology:
• Malignant plasma cells have a perinuclear clearing due to a prominent golgi apparatus and an eccentrically placed nucleus.
• Relatively normal-appearing plasma cells, plasmablasts with vesicular nuclear chromatin and a prominent single nucleolus, or bizarre, multinucleated cells may predominate.
• other cytologic variants include flame cells, Mott cells.
• Flame cells have fiery red cytoplasm, Mott cells contain multiple grapelike cytoplasmic
droplets, a variety of other inclusions, including fibrils, crystalline rods, and globules. The
globular inclusions are referred to as Russell bodies (if cytoplasmic) or Dutcher bodies (if nuclear).
• Rouleaux formation is characteristic but not specific. High levels of M protein in the blood
causes red cells to stick to one another in linear arrays in smears leading to rouleaux formation.

peripheral smear of multiple myeloma:





Bence Jones proteins are excreted in the kidney and causes myeloma kidney. Most myelomas are associated with more than 3 g/dL of serum Ig and/or more than 6 mg/dL of urine Bence Jones
protein. The most common monoclonal Immunoglobulin (M protein) is IgG followed by IgA.
The clinicopathologic diagnosis of multiple myeloma can be done based on the identification of clonal plasma cells in the marrow and the presence of CRAB criteria (hypercalcemia,
renal dysfunction, anemia, and bone lesions).",,A,2074-1339.PNG;2073-1338.PNG;2075-1340.PNG;2076-1342.PNG
Q8,"A pap smear taken from a patient revealed hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear borders, and low maturation index involving the whole thickness but did not breach the basement
membrane. what is the diagnosis?","a)Dysplasia
b)carcinoma
c)Metaplasia
d)Hyperplasia","The hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear borders, and intact basement membrane are all suggestive of dysplasia.
Dysplasia is characterized by the loss in the uniformity of the individual cells and their
architectural orientation. The features of dysplasia include:
• pleomorphism
• Hyperchromatic nuclei
• High nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio
• Increased mitotic figures
when the dysplastic changes involve the entire thickness of the epithelium without breaching the basement membrane it is considered preinvasive and is termed carcinoma-in-situ. If the tumor
invades the basement membrane it is said to be invasive.
Dysplasia can be considered as a precursor to malignant but it does not always progress to cancer. Dysplasia usually occurs in the metaplastic epithelium but all metaplastic epithelium is not
dysplastic.
other options:



Metaplasia: It refers to the replacement of one cell type with another type. It is almost always
associated with tissue damage, repair, and regeneration. The most common epithelial metaplasia is columnar to squamous.
carcinoma: In carcinoma, there is the invasion of the basement membrane.
Hyperplasia: It refers to the increase in the number of cells in a tissue or organ. It can be
physiologic or pathological. Enlargement of the female breast during pregnancy is physiologic hyperplasia. Endometrial hyperplasia is an example of pathological hyperplasia.",,A,
Q9,"The mother of a 12-year-old girl was worried that her daughter is shorter when compared     with her classmates. on examination, the child had a webbed neck, low hairline, and shield chest. A provisional diagnosis of Turner's syndrome was made. which of the following is a   likely finding to be seen in this patient?","a)Aortic dissection
b)subluxation of lens
c)Mitral valve prolapse
d)Bilateral small streak ovaries","The likely finding seen in a patient with Turner syndrome is bilateral small streak ovaries.
Turner syndrome results from complete or partial monosomy ofthe x chromosome. It is
characterized by hypogonadism in phenotypic females. It is the most common sex chromosome abnormality in females. Three types of karyotypic abnormalities are seen
• Missing an entire x chromosome - this results in a 45x karyotype.
• structural abnormalities ofthe x chromosomes - isochromosome of the long arm and loss of the short arm, 46x,i(x)(q1o), deletion of portions of both long and short arms that lead to
the formation of a ring chromosome, 46x,r(x), deletion of portions of the short or long arm, 46x,del(xq) or 46x,del(xp).
• Mosaics - they will have 45x along with one or more karyotypically normal or abnormal cell types. Examples are 45x/46xx, 45x/46xy, 45x/47xxx, 45x/46x,i(x)(q1o).
Important features associated with Turner's syndrome:
• short stature
• webbing of neck
• Broad chest and widely spaced nipples
• cubitus valgus
• streak ovaries
• Infertility, amenorrhea
• peripheral lymphedema at birth
• Low posterior hairline
• Broad chest and widely spaced nipples
• pigmented nevi
• coarctation of aorta
There is failure to develop normal secondary sex characteristics at puberty. The genitalia
remain infantile, breast development is inadequate, and there is little pubic hair. short stature and amenorrhea are of particular importance in establishing the diagnosis in an adult.

Q10,"An 18-year-old male presented to the outpatient department with gum bleeding and fever for the past 2 months. General examination showed pallor and the systemic examination was
unremarkable. Laboratory examination revealed Hb level- 3 gm/dl, TLC- 15oo/microL,
platelet count- 15ooo/microL. peripheral smear shows macrocytes and the reticulocyte count is o.5. Bone marrow examination revealed fatty streaks and absent megakaryocytes but no
immature cells. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Idiopathic acquired aplastic anemia
b)paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
c)Myelodysplastic syndrome
d)Tuberculosis","The given clinical scenario showing a young male with gum bleeding, fever, pancytopenia, and a low reticulocyte count with bone marrow showing fatty streaks and no immature cells is
suggestive of idiopathic acquired aplastic anemia.
Aplastic anemia is a syndrome characterized by chronic hematopoietic failure and pancytopenia. The common causes include:
• Acquired
• Idiopathic (most common cause, about 65% of the cases)
• Acquired stem-cell defects
• Immune-mediated
• chemical agents
• Dose-related (alkylating agents, antimetabolites, benzene, chloramphenicol, inorganic arsenals)
• Idiosyncratic (chloramphenicol, phenylbutazone, organic arsenicals, carbamazepine, penicillamine, gold salts)
• physical agents
• whole-body irradiation
• viral infections (hepatitis, cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, varicella-zoster virus)
• Inherited
• Fanconi anemia
• Telomerase defects



pathogenesis involves an extrinsic immune-mediated suppression of bone marrow and an intrinsic abnormality of the stem cells.
Clinical features and diagnosis:
There is no age or sex predisposition for aplastic anemia. It presents insidiously with features of    pancytopenia such as pallor, petechiae, and ecchymosis. Recurrent infections and fever occur as a result of neutropenia. Reticulocytopenia is seen and splenomegaly is characteristically absent.
Bone marrow biopsy is used for diagnosis.
Histology:
Bone marrow aspirate usually results in a dry tap. Examination shows a hypocellular marrow
devoid of hematopoietic cells with remnant fat cells, fibrous stroma, and scattered lymphocytes. Red cells are usually slightly macrocytic and normochromic. The following image shows a
hypocellular bone marrow with little hematopoiesis and several fat cells.


other options:
option B - paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (pNH) is an acquired disorder resulting from the mutation in the phosphatidylinositol glycan complementation group A gene (pIGA), an
enzyme that is essential for the synthesis of membrane-associated complement regulatory
proteins. Red cells deficient in these proteins are susceptible to intravascular hemolysis. patients with pNH usually present with pancytopenia and reticulocytosis with bone marrow biopsy
showing a cellular marrow with marked to massive erythroid hyperplasia.
option C - Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of clonal stem cell disorders. It is a consequence of maturation defects that result in ineffective hematopoiesis with a high
predisposition to conversion to AML. They are characterized by a hypercellular marrow with   dysplastic cells on bone marrow aspirate. Marrow changes seen in MDS are given in the pearl below.
option D - pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and patients     often present with fever, productive cough, blood-streaked sputum, night sweats, malaise, loss of appetite, and weight loss.",,A,2079-1343.PNG
Q11,"A child is presenting with palpable blanching purpura, abdominal pain, and pain in the knee joint resulting from arthritis. urine examination showed hematuria and proteinuria. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Immune thrombocytopenic purpura
b)Dengue
c)Churg- strauss syndrome
d)Henoch-schonlein purpura","The clinical presentation and the investigations are suggestive of Henoch-schonlein purpura.
Henoch-schδnlein purpura is a systemic immune disorder characterized by a purpuric rash,   abdominal pain, polyarthralgia, and renal abnormalities. It is most commonly seen in the age group of 3-8 years. The patient may present with the following clinical features:
• skin lesions- characteristically involve the extensor surfaces of arms and legs, and also the buttocks
• Abdominal manifestations- include pain, vomiting, and intestinal bleeding.
• Renal manifestations- include gross or microscopic hematuria, nephritic syndrome, or nephrotic syndrome. Renal manifestations are more severe in adults. A rapidly progressive form of
glomerulonephritis is seen in some cases.
This condition usually occurs following an upper respiratory tract infection and there is a history  of atopy in one-third of the cases. IgA is deposited in the glomerular mesangium in a distribution similar to that of IgA nephropathy.
Microscopic findings:
• IgA deposition in the mesangial region. sometimes there is the deposition of IgG and C3 along with IgA.
• Renal lesions show focal or diffuse mesangial proliferation, and/or endocapillary proliferation to crescentic glomerulonephritis.
• skin lesions show subepidermal hemorrhages and necrotizing vasculitis of small vessels.
other options:
option A: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura(ITP): It occurs due to antibody-mediated
destruction of platelets. It can be acute or chronic. Acute ITP is usually self-limiting in nature.  Cutaneous bleeding can be in the form of petechiae and ecchymoses. The patient can also have hematuria, melena, or excessive menstrual flow.
option B: Dengue: It is a viral illness caused by the dengue virus. The clinical manifestations include fever, headache, musculoskeletal pain, and rash. The rash which is maculopapular in nature begins on the trunk and then spreads centrifugally to the face and extremities.
option C: Churg- strauss syndrome (Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis): It is
characterized by eosinophilic vasculitis of multiple organs. The features of this condition
include asthma, peripheral eosinophilia, pulmonary infiltrates, neuropathy, paranasal sinus abnormality, and the presence of eosinophilic vasculitis.",,D,
Q12,"A 54-year-old patient presents to the outpatient department with fatigue, tiredness and
cervical lymphadenopathy. The TLC and DLC were normal. No immature cells. A lymph node biopsy was performed which shows diffuse effacement of the lymph node architecture, cells     with an indented nucleus, prominent nucleolus, and are atypical. CD1o and BCL2 are
positive. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Follicular lymphoma
b)Burkitt lymphoma
c)Mycosis fungoides
d)Chronic myeloid leukemia","The given clinical scenario showing fatigue, tiredness and cervical lymphadenopathy with CD1o positive BCL2 positive cells is highly suggestive of follicular lymphoma.



Follicular lymphoma presents at middle age with no sex predilection. The most common
presenting symptom is painless generalized lymphadenopathy. A lymph node biopsy is adequate for the diagnosis of follicular lymphoma. Immunophenotyping of the cells showing CD19, CD2o, CD1o, BCL2 positive, and CD5 negative is suggestive that the cells originate from the germinal     centre.
The majority of follicular lymphomas have characteristic (14;18) translocation. This juxtaposes the IGH locus on chromosome 14 and the BCL2 locus on chromosome 18. This chromosomal
rearrangement results in the overexpression of BCL2 protein, which is an inhibitor of apoptosis that contributes to lymphoma cell survival.
Histopathology:
Lymph nodes exhibit a nodular or nodular and diffuse growth pattern. Two cell types are predominantly present in varying proportions:
• Centrocytes (small cleaved cells) - small cells with a cleaved nucleus and scant cytoplasm
• Centroblasts - Large cells with open nuclear chromatin, several nucleoli, and modest amounts of cytoplasm
In most cases, there is a majority of centrocytes.
The peripheral blood smear shows lymphocytosis and bone marrow tap reveals paratrabecular lymphoid aggregates.
The following image shows a lymph node biopsy in follicular lymphoma:


other options -
option B - Burkitt lymphoma is an aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). It is also known as small non-cleaved-cell lymphoma and is characterized by the translocation and
deregulation of the c-MYC gene on chromosome 8 to chromosome 14 or 22 - t(8:14) or
t(8:22). Histopathology of the tumor reveals a starry sky appearance created by apoptotic cells and macrophages containing clear cytoplasm.
option C - Mycosis fungoides is the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The    histological hallmark of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides type) is the presence



of pautrier microabscess. The presence of B-cell markers in the question rules out the differential of mycosis fungoides.
option D - Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the presence of chimeric BCR-ABL gene which is a result of a reciprocal (9;22)(q34;q11)
translocation (philadelphia chromosome). The presence of lymphadenopathy in the given scenario rules out the possibility of CML as it is a myeloid disorder.",,A,2081-1344.PNG
Q13,"A software engineer presents to the outpatient department with easy fatiguability. He gives a history of sitting in front of the computer for 12 - 14 hours. He consumes a lot of junk food     with very less fruits and vegetables. Hb is 9gm/dl and McV 12o fl. what is the most likely
cause of this patient's anemia?","a)cyanocobalamin deficiency
b)Folic acid deficiency
c)Iron deficiency
d)Hereditary spherocytosis","The given laboratory values showing anemia and increased MCV are suggestive of megaloblastic anemia. This could be due to cyanocobalamin deficiency or folic acid deficiency. The history of    inadequate intake of fruits and vegetables points towards folic acid deficiency.
Dietary sources of Vit-B12 are animal products such as meat, fish, milk, and eggs. Dietary sources of folic acid are green vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, asparagus, and broccoli.
Megaloblastic anemia can occur due to Vit-B12 or folic acid deficiency. Inadequate intake, intrinsic factor deficiency, pernicious anemia, gastrectomy, malabsorption, ileal
resection, alcoholism, anticonvulsants, oral contraceptives, pregnancy, infancy, disseminated cancer, markedly increased hematopoiesis, folic acid antagonists are some of the causes.
patient can present with anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, constipation, glossitis, angular
cheilosis, reversible melanin skin hyperpigmentation, paresthesias, muscle weakness, dementia, or psychotic disturbances.
In megaloblastic anemia, DNA synthesis is impaired that leading to ineffective hematopoiesis and distinctive morphologic changes.
peripheral blood examination shows oval macrocytes, usually with anisocytosis and poikilocytosis. MCV is usually &gt;1oo fL. The normal value of MCV is between 8o-1oo fL. Most macrocytes lack  the central pallor of normal red cells and even appear hyperchromic, but the MCHC is not
elevated. The reticulocyte count is low. Neutrophils are larger than normal and show nuclear hypersegmentation with five or more nuclear lobules.
Marrow is markedly hypercellular. Megaloblastic changes are seen at all stages of erythroid
development. There is nuclear-to-cytoplasmic asynchrony, where nuclear maturation is slower than cytoplasmic maturation. Granulocytic precursors are seen in the form of giant
metamyelocytes and band forms. Megakaryocytes may be abnormally large with bizarre, multilobate nuclei.

Q14,"A chronic alcoholic patient presented with increasing abdominal girth. on examination,
shifting dullness was present and the liver span was less than 7cm. Histopathological
examination revealed the presence of intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions in hepatocytes. what is the content of these inclusions?","a)Intermediate filaments
b)Actin
c)Microtubules
d)Fibronectin","The clinical scenario given here describes alcoholic hepatitis. In this condition, there are intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions called Mallory Denk bodies and they contain
intermediate filaments.
The liver undergoes inflammation and fibrosis in alcoholic hepatitis. This leads to injured and
sWollen hepatocytes With cleared-out cytoplasm and cytoskeletal damage. These hepatocytes are
called ballooned hepatocytes. when the cytoskeletal damage is extensive, there is the formation of Mallory Denk/ Mallory hyaline bodies. These are remnants of partially degraded intermediate
filaments and are composed of keratin filaments.
Cytoskeletal proteins include intermediate filaments, microfilaments (made up of actin - option
B), and microtubules (option - C).
Intermediate filaments provide a flexible scaffold to organize cytoplasm and prevent external forces from acting on the cell. They are of five types:
• keratin filaments (epithelial cells)
• Neuro filaments (neurons)
• Desmin filaments (muscles)
• Vimentin filaments (connective tissues)



• Glial filaments (glial cells)
Fibronectin (option D) is an adhesive glycoprotein. Its presence in cervicovaginal secretions before rupture of membranes is a possible marker for impending preterm labor.

Q15,A 65-year-old female patient is diagnosed with pure red cell aplasia and a mediastinal mass. which of the following can be the likely cause?,"a)Thymoma
b)Non Hodgkin lymphoma
c)Bronchogenic carcinoma
d)Germ cell tumor","The most probable diagnosis for the clinical presentation of mediastinal mass with pure red cell aplasia is thymoma.
Thymoma refers to the tumors ofthe thymic epithelial cells. Most of the thymic tumors occur in the anterior mediastinum. clinical features can be chest pain, dyspnea, cough, or superior vena  cava syndrome.
It is associated with paraneoplastic syndromes like myasthenia gravis, pure red cell aplasia, or hypogammaglobulinemia. It is rarely associated with limbic encephalitis, hemolytic anemia,
aplastic anemia, and other autoimmune conditions like sjogren's syndrome.
pure red cell aplasia: It is a marrow disorder where the erythroid progenitors are only suppressed. The complete absence of red cell progenitors is seen in severe cases.
causes of pure red cell aplasia: It can be hereditary or acquired. Diamond-Blackfan anemia or   congenital pure red cell aplasia is the hereditary cause. causes of acquired pure red cell aplasia are given below:
• cancer
• Thymoma
