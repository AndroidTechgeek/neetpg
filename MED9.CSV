Q1,A 37-year-old woman presents with headaches for 6 months. she has been taking analgesics    regularly. The headache recently increased in severity for 3 days but was reduced on stopping the analgesic. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)Medication overuse headache
b)Tension headache
c)chronic migraine
d)cluster headache","The clinical features are suggestive of medication overuse headache.
Medication overuse headache:
It is also known as analgesic rebound headache, drug-induced headache, or medication-misuse     headache. In this condition medications that are used for the treatment of headaches become the cause for headaches. It usually resolves when the overuse is stopped.
Diagnostic criteria: According to ICHD-3 (International Classification of Headache Disorders-3)
• Headache occurring on ≥15 days/month in a patient with a pre-existing headache disorder
• Regular overuse for &gt;3 months of one or more drugs that can be taken for acute and/or symptomatic treatment of headache.
• Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.
Management: It includes the following steps:
• withdrawal of the overused medication
• Rescue therapy or the treatment of withdrawal symptoms
• Initiation of preventative therapy if required
• Alternative symptomatic medication for future headaches other options:
option B: Tension headache is a chronic headache syndrome characterized by bilateral, tight band-like discomfort. It can be episodic or chronic in nature. It is usually not associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia, photophobia, etc.
option C: Chronic migraine - Diagnostic criteria for migraine headache is as follows: Repeated attacks of headache lasting 4-72 hours in patients with normal physical examination, no other  reasonable cause for headache, and
option D: Cluster headache is characterized by deep, excruciating, nonfluctuating pain which is usually retroorbital. The classical feature of this condition is its periodicity.  At least one of
the daily attacks of pain recurs at almost the same hour every day.
Typically the patient has daily bouts of one or two attacks of relatively short-duration
unilateral pain for 8–1o weeks a year. In between the clusters, there is a pain-free interval.

At least 2 of the following fea tures	plus at least 1 of the followin g features
unilateral pain	Nausea or vomiting
Throbbing pain	photophobia and phonophob ia
Aggravation by movement	
Moderate or severe intensity",,A,
Q2,"A 2o-year-old woman presents with breathlessness and chest pain. she is a known case of
mitral stenosis. Her pulse is irregularly irregular. No thrombus is seen on echocardiography. what is the best agent to prevent future thrombotic events?","a)Dabigatran
b)Aspirin 15omg
c)oral warfarin
d)Aspirin + clopidogrel","The clinical presentation of breathlessness, chest pain, and irregularly irregular pulse is suggestive of atrial fibrillation. Since the patient is having mitral stenosis oral warfarin is the best agent to
reduce the risk of thrombotic events.
Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation:
Anticoagulation is indicated for patients with mitral stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,    previous history of stroke. In nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, the risk of stroke and the need for anticoagulation is assessed with the cHA2DS2-VASc score.
Anticoagulants that can be used include:
• Vitamin K antagonist - warfarin
• Antithrombin inhibitor - Dabigatran
• Factor xa inhibitors - Rivaroxaban, Apixaban, and Edoxaban
In AF patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves, the anticoagulant of choice is warfarin. The newer anticoagulants are not yet tested for rheumatic heart disease.
warfarin is a less compliant drug because it requires routine PT/INR monitoring for dose
adjustments and has many drug interactions. The newer oral anticoagulants are easy to use and do not require PT/INR monitoring for dose adjustments.
Bleeding is an important risk of anticoagulation. The newer oral agents have a lower risk of intracranial bleeding when compared to warfarin. The risk factors for bleeding include age   &gt;65–75 years, renal insufficiency, heart failure, prior bleeding, and excessive alcohol or    nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use.
Reversal agents for anticoagulants are as follows:
• warfarin - Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma
• Dabigatran - Idarucizumab
• Factor xa inhibitors - Andexanet alpha and ciraparantag",,C,
Q3,Evalutaion of a patient revealed the presence of a mid diastolic murmur. JVP showed prominent a-waves. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)Mitral stenosis
b)Tricuspid stenosis
c)Mitral regurgitation
d)Tricuspid regurgitation","The presence of a mid-diastolic murmur and a prominent a-wave in JVP is suggestive of tricuspid stenosis.
Mid-diastolic murmurs result from obstruction and/or augmented flow at the level of the mitral or
tricuspid valve. Thus, both mitral stenosis (MS) and tricuspid stenosis (TS) present with a
mid-diastolic murmur. However, the presence of a prominent a-wave in JVP is pointing more towards tricuspid stenosis.
causes for mid-diastolic murmur:
• Mitral stenosis
• Tricuspid stenosis
• Atrial myxomas
• Austin flint murmur in severe aortic regurgitation



• Carey-coombs murmur in acute rheumatic fever Tricuspid stenosis:
It always occurs in association with MS and is rheumatic in origin.
Mid-diastolic murmur in TS is best heard along the left sternal border and over the xiphoid process. Murmur is augmented during inspiration and reduced during expiration.
The jugular veins are distended and a giant a-wave is seen in JVP. There is a slow y descent due to impedance of right atrial emptying during diastole.
ECG shows features of right atrial enlargement which includes tall, peaked P wave in lead II and a prominent, upright P wave in lead V1.


other options:
option A: Mid-diastolic murmur is seen in mitral stenosis (MS)
It occurs most commonly in rheumatic fever.
Loud S1 (first heart sound) with an opening snap following S2 (second heart sound) is heard. S2 is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, mid-diastolic murmur which is best heard at the apex with     the patient in a lateral recumbent position.
option C: Holosystolic murmur is seen in mitral regurgitation (MR).
The major causes of MS are infective endocarditis, myocardial infarction, rheumatic fever, and cardiomyopathies.
Soft S1 with a widely split S2 and a low-pitched S3 (third heart sound) is heard in MR. In addition, a holosystolic murmur is prominent at the apex and radiates to the axilla.
option D: Holosystolic murmur is seen in tricuspid regurgitation (TR).
TR is most commonly due to functional defects such as tricuspid annular dilatation and leaflet tethering caused by rheumatic heart disease, myocardial infarction, etc.
The jugular vein is distended. Prominent c-v waves and rapid y descents are seen in severe TR.

Q4,"A chronic alcoholic male patient presented with abdominal distension, reduced urine output, and pedal edema. His serum creatinine was 1.6 mg/dL. what is the next line of management  in this patient?","a)Methylprednisolone
b)Heparin
c)Torsemide
d)octreotide plus albumin","The given features of abdominal distension in a chronic alcoholic are suggestive of liver
failure and reduced urine output, pedal edema and elevated serum creatinine are suggestive    of renal failure. This points towards the diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. Among the given options, octreotide plus albumin will be the next line of management.
octreotide is a somatostatin analogue. It causes splanchnic vasoconstriction and improves renal perfusion. Intravenous albumin is a volume expander and is effective in the management of
hepatorenal syndrome. It is used in combination with other vasoconstrictor agents like
terlipressin or octreotide.
A hepatorenal syndrome is a form of functional renal failure without renal pathology that occurs in patients with advanced cirrhosis or acute liver failure.
There is an increased splanchnic production of vasodilators (nitric oxide) in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Splanchnic vasodilation leads to systemic arterial underfilling resulting    in activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). RAAS activation causes renal      vasoconstriction which leads to decreased renal perfusion resulting in hepatorenal syndrome.
International Ascites club’s Diagnostic criteria of Hepatorenal Syndrome:
Major criteria
• chronic or acute liver disease with advanced hepatic failure and portal hypertension
• Low GFR: serum creatinine &gt;133 μmol/L or 24h creatinine clearance &lt;4o mL/min
• Absence of shock
• Absence of gastrointestinal or renal fluid losses



• No sustained improvement in renal function following diuretic withdrawal and expansion of plasma volume with 1.5 L of isotonic saline
• proteinuria &lt;o.5 g/d and no ultrasonographic evidence of obstructive uropathy or parenchymal renal disease
Additional criteria
• Urine volume &lt;o.5 L/d
• Urine sodium &lt;1o mmol/L
• Urine osmolality &gt; plasma osmolality
• Urine red blood cells &lt;5o high power field
• serum sodium concentration &lt;13o mmol/L Treatment:
The definitive treatment is liver transplantation.
pharmacotherapy mainly consists of drugs that cause splanchnic vasoconstriction. They include
vasopressin analogs (ornipressin, terlipressin), somatostatin analogs (octreotide), and
alpha-adrenergic agonists (midodrine). plasma volume expanders are also effective in the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome.
other treatment options include dialysis and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.
option C: Torsemide is a diuretic. It may trigger hepatorenal syndrome because of intravascular volume depletion.",,D,
Q5,"A 68-year-old man presents with cough with yellowish sputum. Auscultation revealed
bronchial breath sounds. He is hemodynamically stable and not confused. on examination, his respiratory rate is 2o/min and blood pressure is 11o/7o mmHg. Lab reports show urea    levels of 44 mg/dL. what is the next best step in the management of this patient?","a)Give antibiotics and send the patient home
b)Admit to ICU without mechanical ventilation
c)Admit to ICU with invasive mechanical ventilation
d)Consider admission in a non-ICU setting","This patient should be considered for admission in a non-ICU setting.
productive cough along with auscultatory findings of bronchial breath sounds in this patient is suggestive of community-acquired pneumonia.
The next step is to determine the need for hospitalization in community-acquired
pneumonia based on the CURB-65 score.
CURB-65 scoring:
The table below shows the decision based on the CURB-65 score:
Calculating the CURB-65 score for the case given in the question:
• No confusion (score = o)
• Urea is 44 mg/dL (score = 1)
• Respiratory rate is 2o/min (score = o)
• Blood pressure is 11o/7o mmHg (score = o)
• Age is 68 years (score = 1)



Therefore, the total score is 2, and the patient requires hospitalization in a non-IcU setting (medical ward).
Treatment in a non-IcU setting includes respiratory fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin) or a beta lactam antibiotic (cephalosporins) plus a macrolide (azithromycin/clarithromycin).

Q6,"A 3o-year-old man presented with excessive fatiguability towards the end of the day that
improved with rest. He also gives a history of ptosis and difficulty in speech and swallowing. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Myasthenia gravis
b)Lambert-Eaton syndrome
c)Duchenne muscular dystrophy
d)systemic lupus erythematosus","This patient has symptoms of fatiguability that worsen with repetitive movements but resolve
after rest, along with oculobulbar symptoms such as ptosis, dysarthria, and dysphagia. From the given clinical picture, myasthenia gravis is the most likely diagnosis.
Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorder that is characterized by weakness and fatigability of skeletal muscles.
It is due to the autoantibody-mediated destruction of the acetylcholine receptors (AchRs) at the post-synaptic membrane. This consequentially leads to a decreased transmission at
the neuromuscular junction. Failure of transmission results in muscle weakness.
Females are more commonly affected than males and the disease tends to occur in middle age. clinical features of myasthenia gravis:
• Muscle weakness and fatiguability increase with repeated use or during late in the day and may improve following rest or sleep. Limb weakness is proximal and asymmetrical



• cranial muscles particularly the lids and extraocular muscles are involved early in the course - diplopia, ptosis
• Facial weakness - snarling expression on smiling
• weakness in chewing
• Speech with nasal timbre due to the weakness of palate and tongue
• Difficulty in swallowing
• Deep tendon reflexes are intact
• Myasthenic crisis - acute exacerbation of muscle weakness especially intercostal and
diaphragmatic muscles resulting in ventilatory failure. It is most commonly due to infection and anticholinesterase medication overuse.
Myasthenia gravis is associated with thymoma and other autoimmune diseases such as
Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, neuromyelitis optics, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Diagnosis:
• Ice-pack test - application of ice pack over the eyes improves ptosis (decreases activity of
acetylcholinesterase, this increases the amount of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft and increase transmission)
• Antibodies associated with myasthenia gravis: Anti-AchR antibodies, Anti-MuSK antibodies, Anti-LRp4 antibodies
• Repetitive nerve stimulation test shows a decremental response.
• Edrophonium chloride or Tensilon test - improvement of symptoms occurs on injecting
edrophonium. Edrophonium is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. This increases the amount of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft and improves transmission.
Treatment:
• Anticholinesterase drugs - pyridostigmine
• Thymectomy
• Immunosuppression therapy with glucocorticoids, azathioprine, tacrolimus, rituximab, etc.
• plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin other options:
option B:
Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder affecting the
presynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction. It is due to the autoantibodies against the p/Q-type calcium channels at the motor nerve terminal which results in the impaired release of    Ach from the presynaptic nerve terminal.
patients present with proximal muscle weakness of the lower limbs, ptosis, and diplopia.
However, symptoms might improve after brief exercise. Deep tendon reflexes are absent or
reduced. They also experience autonomic dysfunction and present with dry mouth and impotence. It is most commonly associated with small cell lung cancer.
Repetitive nerve stimulation test shows an incremental response at higher rates.



Treatment involves plasmapheresis, immunotherapy, and drugs such as 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP) and pyridostigmine.
option c:
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is X-linked muscular dystrophy due to mutations in the dystrophin gene. It most commonly affects boys in their childhood.
Patients initially present with proximal muscle weakness predominantly of the lower limbs. calf muscle hypertrophy is a cardinal feature. other features include mental retardation, cardiac
failure, and myoglobinuria.
Elevated serum creatinine kinase levels and genetic testing are diagnostic of DMD.
option D:
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that most commonly presents with arthralgia with early morning stiffness. It predominantly occurs in middle-aged women. other
important features of SLE include malar rash, discoid rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, pleuritis, pericarditis, and lupus nephritis.
Anti-nuclear antibodies, Anti-dsDNA antibodies, anti-Smith antibodies are positive in SLE.",,A,
Q7,A woman with hysteria who was hyperventilating developed carpo-pedal spasm. what could be the likely cause for this?,"a)Respiratory acidosis
b)Metabolic acidosis
c)Respiratory alkalosis
d)Metabolic alkalosis","Respiratory alkalosis, developed secondary to hyperventilation, is the likely cause of the
carpopedal spasm.
Hyperventilation leads to the washout of carbon dioxide, resulting in decreased levels of Paco2  (hypocapnia), which in turn increases the pH (alkalosis). Thus, acute respiratory alkalosis occurs during hyperventilation. An increase in extracellular pH increases the binding of free calcium to  albumin, lowering the ionized calcium concentration. This leads to hypocalcemia.
The clinical features of hypocalcemia are:
• Tetany: Increased peripheral neuromuscular irritability. May include perioral paresthesias, muscle spasms, and cramps.
• Trosseau's sign: Induction of carpal spasm when the BP cuff is inflated 2o mm Hg over the systolic BP for three minutes or more.
• chvostek's sign: contraction of the ipsilateral circumoral facial muscles when the facial nerve is tapped just anterior to the ear.
• Severe hypocalcemia can cause seizures, carpopedal spasm, bronchospasm, and laryngospasm.
Treatment of the underlying condition is necessary. The patient should be reassured
and rebreathing from a paper bag should be done during acute episodes.

Q8,"A 1o-year old child presented with recurrent pulmonary infections, and bulky greasy stools.   Quantitative estimation of the stool fat was more than 1ogm/day. which of the following will be seen in this child?","a)protein losing enteropathy
b)Distal intestinal obstruction
c)Hypernatremia
d)Rectal prolapse occurs after treatment","The given clinical scenario showing a young child with recurrent pulmonary infections and steatorrhea with stool fat more than 1o gm/day is suggestive of cystic fibrosis (CF). A distal intestinal obstruction is a common complication seen in this age group.
protein-losing enteropathy occurs due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and is seen most
commonly in infancy (option A). Rectal prolapse was one of the common complications in the past but occurs less frequently due to earlier diagnosis and initiation of pancreatic enzyme
replacement therapy (option D). Individuals with CF develop hypovolemic hyponatremia by
sodium loss via sweat through a defective chloride ion transport channel, the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and hence hypernatremia is not seen in cystic fibrosis (option C).



Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive exocrinopathy affecting multiple epithelial tissues caused primarily due to a mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator [CFTR] gene which   serves as an anion channel in the apical membranes of epithelial cells and regulates the volume
and composition of exocrine secretion. A defect in this gene results in thick, hyper-viscous exocrine secretions which lead to the primary pathologies seen in cystic fibrosis.
Disease manifestations include:
• Respiratory: Copious hyper-viscous and adherent pulmonary secretions obstruct small and medium-sized airways leading to respiratory compromise. Bacterial flora
(including staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) is routinely cultured from CF sputum.
• pancreas: Thick and adherent exocrine secretions obstruct pancreatic ducts and impair the
production and flow of digestive enzymes. There is tissue destruction of the exocrine pancreas, with fibrotic scarring, cyst proliferation, and loss of acinar tissue.
• Hepatic: obstruction of intrahepatic bile ducts and parenchymal fibrosis leading to hepatic insufficiency and multilobular cirrhosis.
• GIT: Contents of the intestinal lumen are often difficult to excrete, leading to meconium ileus in the newborns and distal intestinal obstructive syndrome in adults. with early diagnostic
modalities and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, the occurrence of rectal prolapse is fairly
rare.
• Infertility:
• Males- developmental abnormality secondary to improper secretion by the vas or associated
structures leading to complete involution of the vas deferens and infertility. About 99% of males with CF are infertile
• Females-  abnormalities of the reproductive tract secretions leads to an increased incidence of infertility
• sinusitis: present in most CF patients",,B,
Q9,"A 36-year-old woman presented with claudication in the forearm, transient loss of vision, and abdominal pain. Femoral pulses were weak. Fundus examination revealed retinal
hemorrhages. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)polyarteritis nodosa
b)Thromboangitis obliterans
c)Takayasu arteritis
d)Microscopic polyangitis","The given clinical scenario of a patient presenting with claudication in the forearm, weak femoral pulses, abdominal pain and transient loss of vision is suggestive of Takayasu arteritis.
A patient with polyarteritis nodosa will present with abdominal pain, renal involvement, and
hypertension. Musculoskeletal symptoms present as arthralgia, arthritis, or myalgia. The presence of large vessel symptoms such as claudication in the forearm and weak femoral pulses makes the   diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa unlikely (option A).
Takayasu arteritis is a chronic inflammatory medium- and large- vessel vasculitis that commonly affects adolescents and young females. It mainly involves the aortic arch and its branches.
Depending on the artery occluded, patients present with the following symptoms:
• subclavian artery (most common) - pain, numbness, claudication, and weak or absent radial pulses on the affected side
• Common carotid artery - visual symptoms, syncope, and stroke



• Abdominal aorta, superior mesenteric artery, and coeliac axis - abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting
• Renal artery - hypertension and renal failure
• Aortic arch or root - aortic insufficiency, heart failure
• pulmonary artery - atypical chest pain, dyspnea
• Coronary artery - chest pain, myocardial infarction
• Iliac artery - Leg claudication, weak/absent pulses in the periphery
patients also have constitutional symptoms such as malaise, fever, night sweats, weight loss, etc. Investigations:
• Lab reports reveal an elevated ESR level, anemia, and elevated immunoglobulin levels.
• Arteriography is done as a confirmatory test.
Treatment includes glucocorticoid therapy, methotrexate, immunotherapy with anti-TNF agents, and surgery of the stenosed vessels.
other options:
option A: polyarteritis nodosa (pAN) is necrotizing arteritis of the medium-sized blood vessels. It can affect the skin, peripheral nerves, renal vessels, mesenteric vessels, heart, and brain. Lungs     are usually spared in pAN.The disease initially starts with non-specific symptoms like fever,
malaise, arthralgia, and myalgia. Later, depending on the artery involved, patients may develop the following symptoms:
• Skin findings - ulcers, digital gangrene, subcutaneous nodules, and livedo reticularis
• Renal arteries - hypertension and renal failure
• Mesenteric arteries - abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, bleeding, and a bowel perforation
patients can have musculoskeletal symptoms (arthralgia, myalgia) and mononeuritis multiplex. option B: Thromboangiitis obliterans, also known as Buerger's disease, is an inflammatory
occlusive vascular disorder involving medium- and small-sized vessels in the distal extremities. It is most frequently seen in male smokers less than 4o years of age.The patient presents with a
triad of claudication of the distal extremities, Raynaud's phenomenon, and migratory superficial
vein thrombophlebitis. proximal pulses (brachial artery, femoral artery, popliteal artery) are normal. But distal pulses (radial, ulnar, tibial artery) are weak/absent.
option D: Microscopic polyangiitis is a necrotizing vasculitis affecting small- and medium-sized vessels. It occurs most commonly in elderly males. patients can present with non-constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and musculoskeletal pain. Renal involvement is very
common (79%) in the form of glomerulonephritis, which can rapidly progress, causing renal
failure. It is also associated with mononeuritis multiplex, alveolar hemorrhage (present with
hemoptysis as 1st symptom), and cutaneous vasculitis. Lab findings include anemia, raised ESR and or CRp, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and ANCA positive in 75% of patients,",,C,
Q10,"A diabetic woman is admitted with complaints of vomiting. she gives a history of consuming food from outside. on evaluation, her blood pressure is 9o/6o mmHg. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) report shows the following findings. what is the cause of her ABG findings?","a)Diabetic ketoacidosis
b)persistent vomiting
c)septic shock
d)Renal tubular acidosis","This patient has hypovolemic, hypochloremic, hypokalemic, hyponatremic metabolic alkalosis with respiratory alkalosis. This is most probably due to persistent vomiting.
Inference from the given question stem:
step 1: pH in this patient is 7.52 which is alkalemia.
step 2: Bicarbonate level in this patient is 3o mEq/L which is increased. This signifies the presence of an excess of base. Hence, this is metabolic alkalosis.
step 3: PaCo2 level in this patient is 2o mmHg, which is less than normal. This signifies respiratory alkalosis.
step 4: Electrolyte imbalance -
• Na - 123 mEq/L signifies hyponatremia
• K - 3.2 mEq/L signifies hypokalemia
• Cl - 67 mEq/L signifies hypochloremia
step 5: volume depletion - Blood pressure of 9o/6o mmHg signifies hypovolemia due to persistent vomiting.
vomiting leads to loss of Hcl (acid) from the stomach resulting in metabolic alkalosis and
hypochloremia. This causes failure of secretion of HCo3- into the small intestine and HCo3- is added into the extracellular fluid.
Increased level of HCo3- will be excreted in the urine making the urine alkaline with increased potassium and sodium excretion in the urine. This leads to hypokalemia and hyponatremia.
other options:
option A: Diabetic ketoacidosis is associated with high anion gap metabolic acidosis along with hyponatremia and hypochloremia. It may initially present with hyperkalemia.
option C: septic shock is characterized by high anion gap metabolic acidosis.
option D: Renal tubular acidosis is characterized by hyperchloremic, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis.",,B,
Q11,"A patient presents with fever, nocturnal cough, breathlessness, and wheezing for 4 weeks. Absolute eosinophil count &gt;5ooo/μL. Chest X-ray shows a miliary pattern. what is the  likely diagnosis?","a)Bronchial asthma
b)Miliary tuberculosis
c)Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia
d)Hypersensitivity pneumonitis","The clinical features along with elevated absolute eosinophil count and miliary pattern in chest x-ray are suggestive of tropical pulmonary eosinophilia.
Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE) is a hyperresponsive pulmonary syndrome that occurs in response to trapped microfilariae within the lung parenchyma. It is a type 1 hypersensitivity
reaction.
Clinical features:
The patient has a history of residence in a filaria endemic area and usually presents with
nocturnal paroxysmal wheeze and cough. other manifestations include weight loss, low-grade fever, and lymphadenopathy. Hepatosplenomegaly may be seen due to the trapping of
microfilariae in the reticuloendothelial system.



Investigations:
• Eosinophilia &gt; 3ooo/μL, leucocytosis
• X-ray chest: Mottled opacities or military lesions in the middle and lower lung fields, increased bronchovascular markings
• PFT: Restrictive changes in most cases and obstructive defects in half
• Elevated levels of IgE and Antifilarial antibody titers
• Microfilaria are sequestrated in the lungs and hence not found in blood
Treatment: Diethylcarbamazine(DEc) at a daily dosage of 4-6 mg/kg for 14 days.
Differntial Diagnosis:
• Bronchial asthma
• Loffler syndrome
• Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
• churg strauss syndrome
•
chronic eosinophilic pneumonia
•
Hypereosinophilic syndromes
other options:
option A:  The classical symptoms of bronchial asthma are wheezing, dyspnea, and cough which is worse at night and keeps the patient awake in the early morning hours. chest auscultation
reveals rhonchi throughout the chest. The chest x-ray is usually normal but hyperinflation may be seen in severe patients.
option B: Miliary TB occurs due to the hematogenous spread of tubercle bacilli. clinical features are nonspecific and depend on the site of involvement. common manifestations include fever,
night sweats, anorexia, weakness, and weight loss. Blood investigations may reveal anemia with leukopenia, lymphopenia, neutrophilic leukocytosis, leukemoid reactions, and polycythemia.
chest x-ray shows a military reticulonodular pattern in some cases.
option D: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, also known as extrinsic allergic alveolitis, is an
inflammatory response to various inhaled antigens. The clinical presentation can be acute, subacute, and chronic. History of exposure to the offending antigen is present. chest x-ray findings are nonspecific and can show ground-glass opacities or ill-defined micronodular    opacities.",,C,
Q12,"A middle-aged man with chronic renal failure on dialysis presents with sudden collapse to the casualty with labored breathing. ECG shows tall tented T waves. what is the most likely
acid-base imbalance that can be seen in this patient?","a)pH- 7.14, pCo2- 2o mm Hg, HCo3- 5 mEq/L
b)pH- 7.14, pCo2- 2o mm Hg, HCo3- 34 mEq/L
c)pH - 7.54, HCo3 - 27 mEq/L, pCo2- 34 mm Hg
d)pH- 7.4, HCo3- 27 mEq/L, pCo2 - 4o mm Hg","Metabolic acidosis is the most common acid-base abnormality seen in chronic kidney disease   (cKD) patients due to the defective production of ammonia which impairs the excretion of H+ ions.



In metabolic acidosis, there will be low pH (&lt;7.35), low bicarbonates (&lt;22 mEq/L), and low      pCo2 levels (&lt;35 mm Hg). since the pH in options C and D is &gt;7.35, they can be ruled out. A pH of 7.14 indicates acidosis. The bicarbonate level of 34 mEq/L (in option B) is not consistent
with metabolic acidosis, thus leaving us with option A.
During metabolic acidosis, there is respiratory compensation by hyperventilation resulting in loss of volatile acid causing a reduction in PCo2 levels. The decrease in PCo2 with a decrease in pH    indicates that it is a compensatory mechanism. we can use winter’s formula to check the degree   of respiratory compensation in metabolic acidosis:
pCo2= [1 .5 X HCo3-] + 8 ± 2
= [1.5 X 5] + 8 ± 2
= 13.5-17.5
The expected pCo2 level is 13.5-17.5 mmHg. The pCo2 value of 2ommHg in option A is close to the expected values. Hence, this patient has a partially compensated metabolic acidosis.
In CKD, the kidneys are unable to produce enough ammonia (NH3) in the proximal tubules to excrete the endogenous acid (H+) into the urine in the form of ammonium (NH4+). Therefore, accumulation of H+ occurs causing metabolic acidosis. In the late stages of CKD, the
accumulation of phosphates, sulfates, and other organic anions cause an increase in the anion gap. Thus, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis is seen in the early stages of CKD which then
progresses to high anion gap metabolic acidosis in later stages of CKD.
In CKD, the ability to excrete potassium is decreased. This causes hyperkalemia. Also, metabolic acidosis in CKD causes an extracellular shift of K+ and aggravates hyperkalemia. This is
responsible for the ECG findings of tall tented T waves in this patient.",,A,
Q13,"A woman presents with numbness of her fingertips. on examination, her face is tightened. The antinuclear antibody(ANA) is found to be positive and immunofluorescence shows the nucleolar pattern. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)systemic sclerosis
b)sjogren's syndrome
c)systemic lupus erythematosus
d)Rheumatoid arthiritis","Numbness of fingers associated with Raynaud's phenomenon, facial tightening, positive
anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) with nucleolar pattern in immunofluorescence is highly suggestive of systemic sclerosis.
systemic sclerosis/ scleroderma:
systemic sclerosis (ssc) is an autoimmune connective tissue disorder that results in fibrosis of the skin, vasculature, and internal organs. It is of two types, namely diffuse cutaneous systemic
sclerosis and limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis.
scleroderma is characterized by Raynaud's phenomenon, digital ischemia, sclerodactyly,
calcinosis, telangiectasia, and cardiac, lung, gastrointestinal and renal disease. skin thickening is the hallmark of ssc. Patients have a characteristic expressionless facial appearance with taut and shiny skin and microstomia.
Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are positive in ssC. The presence of anti-topoisomerase 1 (scl7o) and anticentromere antibodies are seen in diffuse cutaneous ssC and limited cutaneous ssc
respectively.
Nucleolar pattern of ANA staining in immunofluorescence is most commonly seen in systemic sclerosis. A centromeric pattern is also seen.

Q14,"A 45-year-old woman with a history of hypertension presented to the emergency room with   loss of consciousness, chest pain, and diaphoresis. on examination, she was grossly unstable and the bilateral pulses were unequal. ECG showed nonspecific sT-T changes. what is the
next best investigation?","a)MRI
b)Transesophageal echocardiography
c)cardiac enzymes
d)X ray","The clinical presentation and ECG showing nonspecific ST-T changes are highly suggestive of aortic dissection. As the patient is hemodynamically unstable the next best investigation
is transesophageal ECHo.
Aortic dissection:
This occurs when a defect or flap occurs in the intima of the aorta. It results in blood tracking into the aortic tissues and splitting of the medial layer of the aorta.
predisposing factors:
• Age
• Hypertension
• Marfan syndrome
• pregnancy
• other connective tissue disorders, for example, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, giant cell arteritis, systemic lupus erythematosus
• Coarctation of the aorta
• Turner or Noonan syndromes
• Aortic cannulation site (iatrogenic)
Clinical features:
The most typical presentation of aortic dissection is a tearing interscapular pain. It is associated with diaphoresis. other symptoms are syncope, weakness, and dyspnea. on examination, there   can be hypertension or hypotension, loss of pulses, findings of aortic regurgitation, pulmonary    edema, or neurological manifestations. unequal pulses or blood pressure in the extremities may be seen due to changes of flow in the true and false lumens.



ECG findings: An ECG that shows no findings of acute myocardial infarction helps to differentiate aortic dissection from myocardial infarction.
Imaging:
In hemodynamically stable patients the diagnosis is established with a contrast-enhanced CT scan. The characteristic diagnostic finding is a double lumen aorta.
Transesophageal ECHO(TEE) is the investigation of choice in a hemodynamically unstable patient.


Treatment:
The initial management is with beta-blockers to control hypertension, along with pain
management. The preferred beta-blocker is esmolol. These reduce cardiac contractility and blood pressure.
Isolated use of a direct vasodilator such as hydralazine is contraindicated in acute dissection
because these agents can increase hydraulic shear and worsen the dissection. CCBs like verapamil and diltiazem may be used intravenously if nitroprusside or beta-blockers cannot be employed.
Once hypertension is controlled, definitive surgical repair of aortic dissection is done. Treatment options depend on the classification.
• stanford Type A (DeBakey types I and II) requires surgical intervention once the patient's blood pressure is stabilized.
• stanford Type B (DeBakey type III) is best managed by antihypertensive drugs. surgical
intervention is indicated in complicated cases if the pain increases (signaling impending rupture) or when there is evidence of malperfusion of organs or neurological symptoms.",,B,4342-2743.PNG;4343-2744.PNG
Q15,"A 1o-year-old child with AIDs presented with fever and productive cough. on auscultation,    bronchial breath sounds and crepitations were heard in the right infra-scapular region. chest X-ray showed right lower lobe consolidation. The cD4 count was 55 cells/mm3. what is the    most common causative organism for this condition?","a)pneumocystis jirovecii
b)streptococcus pnuemoniae
c)staphylococcus aureus
d)Mycoplasma","The given clinical features of productive cough with fever, bronchial breath sounds and
crepitations on auscultation along with lower lobe consolidation on chest X-ray point towards the diagnosis of lobar pneumonia.
The most common causative organism is Streptococcus pneumonia, irrespective of HIV status. In AIDS patients, opportunistic infection-causing bacterial pneumonia occurs at any clinical stage
and at any CD4 cell count. pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia would present with dry cough and interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray (option A).
patients with pneumococcal (lobar) pneumonia present with fever, dyspnea,
and productive cough. on examination, involved lobes are dull to percussion, bronchial breath sounds, and crackles are heard on auscultation.
A chest radiograph reveals focal, segmental, or lobar consolidation of involved lobes.





other options:
option A:
pneumocystis jiroveci causes pneumocystis pneumonia (pcp) in AIDs patients with cD4 counts below 2oo cells/mm3.
pcp presents with fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. Inspiratory crackles are heard on auscultation. chest X-ray reveals bilateral, symmetric, interstitial infiltration. Initially, infiltrates are perihilar, as the disease progress, it becomes diffuse.
The chest radiographs given below show ground-glass opacities in pcp


option c:
staphylococcus aureus causes bacterial pneumonia with features similar to pneumococcal   pneumonia. The differentiating feature is that chest X-ray in staph. aureus infection shows pneumatoceles (cavitation).



The X-ray shows pneumatoceles (air-filled cysts within lung parenchyma).


option D: Mycoplasma causes atypical pneumonia. patients present with dry cough, fever, chills, malaise, and upper respiratory tract symptoms. on auscultation, wheezes or rales are
heard. chest X-ray shows peribronchial pneumonia with prominent bronchial markings, interstitial infiltration, and atelectasis.

Q16,"A patient presents with a seizure. on evaluation, urine osmolality is 1ooo mosm/kg and   serum osmolality is 27o mosm/kg. which electrolyte abnormality can be expected in this patient?","a)Hypernatremia
b)Hyponatremia
c)Hyperkalemia
d)Hypokalemia","This patient has high urine osmolality of 1ooo mosm/kg (normal 5oo-8oo mosm/kg) and low     plasma osmolality of 27o mosm/kg (normal 285-295 mosm/kg). This is seen in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone synthesis (SIADH) and hyponatremia is the most common



electrolyte abnormality seen.
Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone ADH release (SIADH) is a condition where there is an unsuppressed release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the pituitary gland or
nonpituitary sources or its continued action on vasopressin receptors.
ADH promotes the reabsorption of water from the collecting duct. Excessive secretion of ADH in SIADH results in enhanced water reabsorption. Therefore, only water is reabsorbed and not the   solutes resulting in concentrated urine. This is depicted as high urine osmolality. The excess of     water reabsorbed from the tubules expand and dilute the extracellular fluid leading to dilutional  hyponatremia. This is depicted as low plasma osmolality.
Since there is an increase in body water with little or no change in body sodium in SIADH, this is known as euvolemic hyponatremia.
patients may be asymptomatic or present with headache, confusion, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, seizures, and coma.",,B,
Q17,A male patient had feeble femoral pulses with upper-limb blood pressure of 186/9o mmHg. chest X-ray showed enlarged intercostal arteries. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)coarctation of aorta
b)Atrial septal defect
c)Bicuspid aortic valve
d)patent ductus arteriosus","The given clinical features of hypertension in the upper limb, weak lower limb pulse, and enlarged intercostal arteries on chest X-ray are pointing towards the diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta.
coarctation of the aorta is a congenital heart defect characterized by the narrowing of the thoracic aorta near the insertion of the ductus arteriosus. It is associated with the bicuspid aortic valve,
atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, mitral regurgitation, berry aneurysm, and Turner syndrome. It is more common in males.
Depending on the site of constriction it may be-
• preductal - constriction proximal to the ductus arteriosus. (infantile type)
• postductal - constriction distal to the ductus arteriosus (adult type).
physical examination findings include-
• Bounding upper limb pulses (radial, carotid) and weak lower limb pulses (femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis)
• Increased Radio-femoral delay
• Hypertension in upper limbs; hypotension in lower limbs
• Difference in blood pressure of more than 2o mmHg between upper and lower limbs
• continuous machinery like murmur (due to collaterals) is heard over the scapula
• Systolic ejection click and systolic ejection murmur in the left upper sternal border (due to bicuspid aortic valve)
Radiologically, the chest X-ray may reveal-
• Figure 3 sign - pathognomonic of coarctation of the aorta. Due to indentation of the aorta at the site of coarctation and pre and post-stenotic dilatation along the left paramediastinum.





• Notching of ribs  (Roesler's sign) due to inferior rib erosion by dilated intercostal collateral vessels.
• collateral blood supply occurs from the arch of the aorta to the descending thoracic aorta bypassing the narrowed aorta.
• It occurs via the arch of the aorta → internal thoracic artery → anterior intercostal artery → posterior intercostal artery → descending thoracic aorta.
• 4th to 8th ribs are most commonly involved. 1st and 2nd ribs are spared as the intercostal arteries in these ribs do not communicate with the descending aorta.",,A,4347-2750.PNG;4347-2749.PNG
Q18,"A patient who is a known case of atherosclerosis underwent a circumflex artery bypass. The     stent is now placed successfully. He is already taking lisinopril, verapamil, metoprolol. which drug should be added?","a)PDE 3 inhibitor
b)Direct oral anticoagulant
c)P2y12 receptor blocker
d)PDE 5 inhibitor","P2y12 receptor blocker should be added to prevent stent thrombosis.



Clopidogrel, a P2y12 receptor blocker, along with aspirin is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).
DAPT should be continued for at least 1 year following stent placement to prevent stent
thrombosis. After the recommended duration of treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy, aspirin should be continued indefinitely.",,C,
Q19,which of the following statement is incorrect regarding pheochromocytoma?,"a)Diagnosed by urine VMA &amp; catecholamines
b)surgical excision is the definitive treatment
c)Propranolol is given initially to manage hypertension
d)Can present as hypertension alone and sometimes with vomiting and pain abdomen","Alpha-blockers like phenoxybenzamine are given initially to manage hypertension
in pheochromocytoma. Beta-blockers such as propranolol are given only after adequate alpha blockade is achieved.
Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine secreting tumor. High levels of circulating catecholamines stimulate the alpha receptors on the blood vessels and cause vasoconstriction, resulting in
hypertension. If β-blockers are given initially, it will lead to unopposed α-stimulant action of catecholamines leading to hypertensive crisis. This is the rationale behind prescribing
alpha-blockers initially and then followed by β-blockers in pheochromocytoma.
Pheochromocytoma:
Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine secreting tumor derived from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla.
It can be sporadical or hereditary. Hereditary pheochromocytoma occurs in association with syndromes such as MEN 2 (Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2), familial paraganglioma
syndrome, Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) syndrome, and neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1.
Clinical features:
It most commonly presents as a classic triad of intermittent headache, palpitation, and profuse sweating along with hypertension. The patient can also present with anxiety, panic
attacks, nausea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and weakness.
symptoms may be precipitated by surgery, pregnancy, position changes, exercise, and
medications such as metoclopramide and tricyclic antidepressants.
Investigations:
• Biochemical screening test - measurement of urinary and plasma levels of catecholamines and metanephrines.
• MRI is the investigation of choice for localizing the tumor. It is preferred over a CT scan as the contrast used in CT scans can precipitate paroxysms.
• Other imaging modalities like MIBG scintigraphy, DOPA- or FDG- PET scan are used in identifying the primary tumor as well as the extra-adrenal tumors and metastases.
Treatment:
surgical resection of the tumor is the definitive treatment for pheochromocytoma.
Preoperatively, hypertension is managed initially with alpha-blockers followed by beta-blockers. Postoperatively, lifelong yearly follow-up should be done.",,C,
Q20,"A patient with giant cell arteritis presented with headache, jaw claudication, polymyalgia rheumatica, and mononeuritis multiplex. what should be the first-line treatment for this patient?","a)Abatacept
b)Tocilizumab
c)steroids
d)Aspirin","Steroids are the first-line management for giant cell arteritis.
Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis is an inflammation of medium and large-sized vessels. It is more common in women and people aged &gt;5o years.
The clinical features include headache associated with scalp pain and jaw claudication, fever,
fatigue, malaise, and weight loss. Half of the patients have signs of superficial temporal artery
inflammation, including erythema, pain on palpation, nodularity, thickening, or reduced pulsation on the affected side. Gentle pressure on the scalp may elicit focal or generalized tenderness.
GCA is very commonly associated with polymyalgia rheumatica characterized by morning stiffness and pain around the shoulders and hip. It is also associated with mononeuritis multiplex which is  characterized by peripheral neuropathy in two or more separate nerve areas.
A dreaded complication is ischemic optic neuropathy, which can lead to sudden blindness.
Therefore, patients with a clinical diagnosis of GCA, especially with headaches or visual symptoms should immediately be started on steroids. If treatment is delayed beyond 48 hours, there may be  irreversible damage.
Lab reports reveal an elevated ESR level, hypo-/normo-chromic anemia, elevated alkaline
phosphatase levels, and increased levels of IgG and complement. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a temporal artery biopsy. It may not be positive in all patients, due to patchy involvement of    the vessels. obtaining a biopsy segment of 3-5 cm with serial sectioning may yield a positive
result. A color doppler ultrasound can be used as an alternative.
The mainstay of treatment in GCA is steroids. prednisolone 4o-6o mg is given for one month followed by tapering doses. The duration of treatment is approximately 2 years or more.
Methylprednisolone 1ooo mg for 3 days should be given for patients presenting with visual symptoms.
Aspirin reduces the occurrence of visual loss and can be given in addition to steroids. Newer drugs used in the treatment of giant cell arteritis are tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor)
and abatacept (CTLA4-Ig). Both these drugs are used adjunctively to steroid therapy.
Histopathology of giant cell arteritis shows panarteritis with infiltration of inflammatory
mononuclear cells with giant cell formation. Intimal thickening and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina is also seen.
The image below shows internal elastic lamina fragmentation (black arrow) and giant cells (yellow arrow) in a cerebral artery.",,C,4350-2751.PNG
Q21,"A 5o-year-old man presents with a history of recurrent retrosternal chest pain with each
episode lasting for 3-5min and subsiding with sublingual nitrate. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy and flat T-wave. He is a known case of hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
hypercholesterolemia currently on aspirin, atenolol, metformin, and lovastatin. what is the next best step in management?","a)IV glyceryl trinitrate infusion
b)Injection enoxaparin
c)Add clopidogrel
d)Increase the dose of beta blocker","The given clinical scenario of recurrent chest pain relieved on nitrates in a patient with
hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia are suggestive of acute coronary
syndrome. ECG showing flat T wave and left ventricular hypertrophy favors the diagnosis of
non-ST segment elevated acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). Injection enoxaparin is the next best step in management.
Enoxaparin, a low molecular weight heparin, is used as a first-line anticoagulant therapy to prevent thrombosis in patients with NSTE-ACS.
Patients with acute coronary syndrome are classified into ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) and NSTE-ACS.
Management of NSTE-ACS:
Supportive therapy - supplemental oxygen
Anti-ischemic drugs:
• Sublingual or IV nitrates
• Beta-blockers
Antithrombotic treatment consists of anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy.
The anticoagulants used are low molecular weight heparin such as enoxaparin, fondaparinux.
other anticoagulants used are unfractionated heparin (UFH), bivalirudin, and direct oral
anticoagulants such as dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban. UFH is the mainstay of therapy.
Antiplatelet drug, aspirin, is the preferred drug in NSTE-ACS treatment. P2y12 receptor inhibitors like prasugrel, ticagrelor, cangrelor, clopidogrel are also used. Clopidogrel is used only when
prasugrel or ticagrelor are not available/ contraindicated.
GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors - eptifibatide and tirofiban - are also used as alternatives.



Invasive treatment - percutaneous coronary intervention- is done after stabilizing the patient with the above-mentioned drugs.
other options:
option A: Intravenous glyceryl trinitrate infusion is only given when chest pain is not relieved by sublingual nitrates. This patient has chest pain controlled by sublingual nitrates. Hence, IV GTN  infusion is not recommended.
option C: Clopidogrel is used in combination with aspirin or when aspirin is
intolerable/contraindicated. However, prasugrel or ticagrelor is preferred over clopidogrel and is initiated after anticoagulant therapy.
option D: Beta-blockers are used to reduce pain. This patient does not present with pain and also mentions that the pain is relieved on sublingual nitrates. Increasing the dose of beta-blocker has   no benefit in this situation.",,B,
