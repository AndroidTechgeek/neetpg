Q1,All of the following are seen in anemia of chronic disease except:,"a)High serum hepcidin
b)Low serum ferritin
c)chronic infection
d)Adequate iron stores","Low serum ferritin levels are not seen in anemia of chronic disease.
Anemia of chronic disease is anemia resulting due to chronic diseases which produce systemic inflammation. During chronic inflammation, inflammatory mediators like interleukin - 6(IL-6) stimulate the production of hepcidin from the liver. Hepcidin is an acute phase reactant that



inhibits ferroportin on macrophages and also decreases iron from stores to developing RBc
precursors. This results in decreased proliferation of erythroid progenitors due to impaired iron utilization.
By decreasing available serum iron, the body defends itself from certain bacteria(Eg, Hemophilus influenza) that require iron for their pathogenicity. The lab findings seen in anemia of chronic
disease are:
• Low serum iron
• Decreased total iron-binding capacity
• Abundant stored iron
• Increased hepcidin levels
• Increased serum ferritin
The chronic illnesses associated with  anemia of chronic disease can be grouped into three categories:
• chronic microbial infections, such as osteomyelitis, bacterial endocarditis, and lung abscess
• chronic immune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and regional enteritis
• Neoplasms, such as carcinomas ofthe lung and breast and Hodgkin lymphoma
Note: Hepcidin is the main regulator of iron absorption which is encoded by the HAMP gene and is defective in hemochromatosis.
Given below is an image of iron absorption that shows ferroportin being inhibited by hepcidin at intestinal mucosal cells",,B,2108-1361.PNG
Q2,Neurosecretory bodies are seen in all except,"a)pituitary adenoma
b)paraganglioma
c)Adrenal cortical tumor","Neurosecretory bodies are not seen in adrenal cortical tumours.



Most ofthe adrenocortical neoplasms are aldosterone-producing adenomas. Conn syndrome is primary hyperaldosteronism caused by a solitary aldosterone-secreting adenoma.
The clinical features of hyperaldosteronism are secondary hypertension and various neuromuscular manifestations resulting from hypokalemia.
Microscopically, aldosterone-producing adenomas are found to have eosinophilic, laminated cytoplasmic inclusions, known as spironolactone bodies, found after treatment with the
antihypertensive drug spironolactone.
The image given below shows a microscopic image of spironolactone bodies found in adrenal adenomas


other options:
option A: Medullary thyroid carcinoma arises from parafollicular C cells and they produce
calcitonin. They are associated with a point mutation in the RET proto-oncogene and multiple
endocrine neoplasias (MEN 2A and 2B). Microscopically, polygonal cells in an amyloid stroma are seen. Electron microscopy reveals neurosecretory granules within the cytoplasm.
option B: pituitary adenoma may present with visual field abnormalities or pituitary apoplexy
(acute haemorrhage into an adenoma). prolactinoma is the most common type of
hyperfunctioning pituitary adenoma. Histologically, prolactinomas are composed of chromophobe cells with cytoplasmic neurosecretory granules.
option C: Adrenal medullary pheochromocytomas are the most common paraganglioma.
Extra-adrenal paragangliomas occur in the head and neck at carotid bodies. Microscopically, carotid body tumours contain nests (zellballen) of chief cells. Electron microscopy shows
well-demarcated neurosecretory granules.",,D,2109-1362.PNG
Q3,Identify the true statement/s regarding clear cell carcinoma of the kidney,"a)1, 2, 4
b)2, 3
c)1, 3
d)1, 4","True statements regarding clear cell carcinoma of the kidney are 1, 4. Clear cell carcinoma is
the most common sporadic renal cell cancer and cells show intracellular accumulation of glycogen



and fat.
clear cell cancer arises from the proximal tubular epithelium and usually occurs as solitary unilateral lesions.
Most of the cases are sporadic, but can also occur either in familial forms or in association
with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. They are associated with the loss of sequence of the short arm of chromosome 3. Those with VHL disease inherit a germline mutation of the VHL gene on   chromosomal band 3p25 and lose the second allele by somatic mutation.
The VHL protein causes the degradation of hypoxia-induced factors (HIFs), which are
transcription factors that contribute to carcinogenesis by stimulating the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that helps drive tumour cell growth.
Histologically, the tumour cells have a rounded or polygonal shape and abundant clear or granular cytoplasm, which contains glycogen and lipids.
Given below is the histopathological image of clear cell carcinoma.


cancerous cells produce various abnormal hormones resulting in paraneoplastic syndrome. These include polycythemia, hypercalcemia, cushing syndrome, amyloidosis and hypertension.
The most common site of metastasis is the lungs and bones. Radical nephrectomy is the treatment of choice. But T1a(size less than 4cm) tumours are treated by nephron-sparing surgery or partial    nephrectomy to preserve renal function. Drugs that inhibit VEGF and tyrosine kinase inhibitors
are used as an adjunct therapy for metastatic disease.",,D,2110-1363.PNG
Q4,The phenomenon of a differential effect of the same gene from different parents is called:,"a)Gonadal mosaicism
b)Genomic imprinting
c)Anticipation
d)Incomplete penetrance","The phenomenon of a differential effect of the same gene from different parents is called genomic imprinting.
Genomic imprinting refers to gene silencing/ inactivation. Here either the maternal or the
paternal allele is inactivated resulting in only one functional allele. It occurs by the process of



epigenetics, where gene expression is lowered by:
• DNA methylation
• Histone deacetylation
Genomic imprinting is best illustrated by two uncommon genetic disorders: prader-willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome.
The image given below is a child with prader-willi syndrome

The image given below is a child with Angelman syndrome:





Diagnosis of these syndromes is based on the assessment of the methylation status of marker genes and fluorescence in-situ hybridisation(FIsH).
other options:
option A: Gonadal mosaicism is a mutation that occurs only in egg or sperm cells and the
individual will be phenotypically normal. These individuals with gonadal mosaicism can transmit the disease-causing mutation to the offspring through their mutated
gametes.
option C: Anticipation refers to earlier onset of disease or increased severity in succeeding generations. This is seen in trinucleotide repeat disorders like Huntington's disease.
option D: Incomplete penetrance refers to variations in penetrance and expressivity of clinical features. Not all individuals who inherit the mutant gene show a mutant phenotype.

• schiller Duval bodies - yolk sac tumor
• presence of teeth, hair, etc - Teratoma
• signet ring cells - kruckenberg tumor
• call-Exner bodies - Granulosa cell tumor
schiller Duval bodies are seen in yolk sac tumors. A yolk sac tumor/endodermal sinus tumor is an aggressive malignant germ cell tumor of the ovaries. Most of the yolk sac tumors
have schiller-Duval bodies and they are pathognomonic. These are glomerulus-like structures
consisting of a central vessel surrounded by tumor cells within a space that is also lined by tumor cells.
The image given below shows schiller-Duval bodies seen in yolk sac tumors.


presence of hair, teeth, etc is seen in teratomas. These are germ cell tumors. They
contain embryonic tissues leading to the differentiation of cells along these pathways. Apart from teeth, hair may also contain skin, sebaceous glands, fat, bone, cartilage, etc.



There are three classes of teratomas:
• Mature teratomas (eg - dermoid cyst)
• Immature teratomas (eg - solid teratoma)
• Monodermal highly specialized tumors (eg - struma ovarii)
Given below is the histopathological image of immature teratoma of the ovary, with immature tissue of the bone (asterisk), cartilage (arrow), and islands of adipose tissue (arrowhead)


signet-ring cells are seen in the krukenberg tumor. krukenberg tumor is the carcinoma of the stomach that metastasize to the ovary. signet ring cells are mucin-producing cells. The
appearance of a signet ring often originates from the gastric mucosa.
The image below shows signet-ring cells in the kruckenberg tumor.


option D: Granulosa cell tumours arise from granulosa cells which form part of the developing     ovarian follicle. They are unilateral in nature and the mass is cystic and encapsulated. call-Exner

Q7,A patient suffering from cholelithiasis underwent cholecystectomy. The image of the specimen is shown below. which of the following is the correct diagnosis?,"a)Cholesterolosis
b)Gallbladder polyp
c)Carcinoma gallbladder
d)strawberry gallbladder","The correct diagnosis in the patient is gallbladder polyp.
Gallbladder polyp is a pre-malignant condition that usually presents with biliary colic and
cholecystitis. cholesterol polyps are more common while adenomatous polyps have malignant potential.
Risk factors of malignancy in adenomatous polyp:
• Age &gt;6o years
• coexistence of gall stones
• The documented increase in size
• Size of &gt;1o mm.
polyps less than 1 cm can be followed with serial ultrasonography. The USG given below depicts gallbladder polyps that are fixed and do not cast any acoustic shadow. The polyps larger than 1   cm have an increased risk of malignancy and should be treated by performing an open
cholecystectomy.

option C: Gallbladder adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy of the extrahepatic biliary tract. Gallstones are the most important risk factor. Her-2/neu is overexpressed and CA 19-9 is
used for monitoring. The most important prognostic factor is the depth of invasion (T-stage). on gross appearance, they resemble chronic cholecystitis.",2087-1347.PNG,B,2116-1371.PNG;2116-1370.PNG;2117-1373.PNG;2117-1372.PNG
Q8,"A 15-year-old boy presents with swelling in the upper diaphyseal part of the tibia. X-ray of the swelling showed a periosteal reaction. A histopathological image of the biopsy is given below.  Immunohistochemistry was positive for synaptophysin and mic 2. what is the likely
diagnosis?","a)osteosarcoma
b)Ewing sarcoma
c)Metastatic neuroblastoma
d)osteoclastoma","The given clinical scenario along with the image showing small round blue cells
and immunohistochemistry (IHC) positive for synaptophysin and mic-2 point to a likely diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma.
Ewing sarcoma is the 2nd most common bone sarcoma in children. The majority of the patients affected are usually &lt;2o years of age. It has a slight male predominance.
It commonly involves the diaphysis of the long bones like the femur, tibia, fibula, and humerus and flat bones of the pelvis. The majority of Ewing sarcomas have a balanced translocation
between the EwSR1 gene on chromosome 22 and the FLI1 gene on chromosome 11.
Patients present with painful enlarging mass, fever, and anemia. The affected area is usually
tender, swollen, and warm. Laboratory findings may show an elevated wBC count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).
A histopathological examination of Ewing sarcoma shows sheets of uniform, round cells arranged in Homer-wright rosettes. These cells are of neuroectodermal origin and have minimal cytoplasm
and abundant glycogen. when they are arranged around a central fibrillary core in the form of clusters, the appearance is termed Homer-wright rosettes. Immunohistochemistry is
usually positive for synaptophysin and mic-2.
Given below is the histopathological appearance of Ewing sarcoma.


As tumor cells are rich in glycogen, they stain positive for periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain however, they stain negatively for reticulin.
The image given below shows PAS staining done in Ewing's sarcoma:





Radiological examination of Ewing sarcoma shows a destructive lesion in the diaphysis of long     bones. Deposition of periosteal reaction in layers gives an onion-peel appearance (shown below).


other options:
option A: osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy of bone. The histological
features of osteosarcoma include pleomorphic cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and abundant mitoses. The diagnosis is definitive with the presence of malignant tumor cells producing
unmineralized osteoid or mineralized bone arranged in a typically fine, lacelike pattern.
Given below is the histopathological image of osteosarcoma:





X-ray shows periosteal reaction and it may take the form of a Codman's triangle or it may have a sunray appearance as shown below.


option C: Neuroblastoma is a tumor of the sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medulla. It is derived from primordial neural crest cells. It is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood.    on histopathology small round blue cells are seen. These cells are concentrically arranged around a faintly eosinophilic fibrillary material (neuropil). This appearance is called Homer-wright
pseudorosettes (shown below).





option D: osteoclastoma is also known as a giant cell tumour. The tumor cells are primitive   osteoblast precursors and express high levels of RANKL. Histologically, the tumors consist of osteoclast-type giant cells with 1oo or more nuclei. These cells are usually present against a     backdrop of mononuclear stromal cells.
The image given below shows the histopathological appearance of giant cell tumour/osteoclastoma:

Q9,which of the following is a marker of natural killer cell?,"a)CD 68
b)CD 3
c)CD 25
d)CD 94","The marker of the natural killer cells is CD94. It is expressed in natural killer cells and a small subset of T lymphocytes.
Natural killer cells (NK cells) are essential cells of innate immunity. They act against malignant and virus-infected cells. NK cells are identified by CD16 and CD56 cell surface receptors.
NK cells' activity is augmented by interferons and upon activation, they bind to glycoprotein receptors on the surface of target cells and release perforins. perforins create pores in the
membrane of the target cells. Through these pores, cytotoxic factors like tumor necrosis factor-beta (TNF-β) enter the cells and destroy them by apoptosis.
NK cells express a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Here, NK cells have the capability of killing target cells that are coated by IgG antibodies.
The image given below shows the actions of NK cells on cancer cells.





other options:
option A: CD68 is expressed on macrophages and monocytes.
option B: CD 3 is a T-cell receptor marker. They are involved in the transduction of signals to the T cells when an antigen binds to the T cell receptor.
option C: CD 25 is a component of the IL2 receptor and is important in T cell proliferation and activation.",,D,2123-1382.PNG
Q10,which of the following conditions is not caused by high-risk strains of human papillomavirus?,"a)Cervical cancer
b)Anal cancer
c)oropharyngeal cancer
d)Laryngeal papillomatosis","Laryngeal papillomatosis is not caused by high-risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV). It is caused by low-risk HPV strains 6 and 11.
Laryngeal papillomatosis or juvenile papillomatosis is the most common benign neoplasm of
the larynx in children. It is caused by HPV 6 and 11. It involves supraglottic and glottic regions of the larynx. Adult-onset laryngeal papillomatosis involves the anterior part of the vocal cords.
It usually occurs between the ages 3–5 years, but less commonly can also occur in men aged between 3o-5o years. Clinical features include hoarseness or aphonia and respiratory
difficulty. The recurrence rate is high but they rarely transform to SCC.
Diagnosis is confirmed by direct laryngoscopy and biopsy. Treatment consists of micro
laryngoscopy, Co2 laser excision, and topical cidofovir.

Q11,"A boy presents with recurrent episodes of melena. on examination, there was eczema of the skin with multiple petechiae. His platelet count was low but RBC and wBC counts were
within normal limits. which of the following is the diagnostic investigation in this patient?","a)wASP gene mutation
b)Anti platelet antibodies
c)Bone marrow biopsy
d)Electron microscopy","The given scenario of recurrent episodes of melena, eczema, and multiple petechiae along with
low platelet counts is suggestive of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. The diagnostic investigation in this patient is WASP gene mutation testing.
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome(WAS) is an X-linked recessive immunodeficiency disorder. It is caused by mutations in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) that primarily affects the T
lymphocytes.
Normally, WASp regulates the actin cytoskeleton and thus helps in cell adhesion, migration, and the formation of synapses between antigen-presenting and target cells. In WAS, there is a
progressive loss of T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood resulting in defects in cellular
immunity.
The clinical features of WAS are recurrent bacterial infections, eczema, and bleeding due
to thrombocytopenia. Patients with WAS are prone to develop B-cell lymphomas and autoimmune disorders.
The image given below shows eczema seen in WAS





Diagnosis is based on intracellular immunofluorescence analysis of wAS protein (wASp)
expression in blood cells. IgM levels in the serum are low, but levels of IgG are usually normal. Reduced-sized platelet is a typical feature of wAS.
The only curative treatment is an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. prophylactic
antibiotics, immunoglobulin G (IgG) supplementation, and topical treatment for eczema can be tried. Gene therapy trials are also under research.",,A,2125-1384.PNG
Q12,which of the following is not a part of innate immunity?,"a)Alpha defensins
b)B lymphocytes
c)Gamma Delta T lymphocytes
d)Lectin pathway","B lymphocytes are not a part of innate immunity. B lymphocytes are part of adaptive immunity.
Innate immunity is an intrinsic mechanism that provides the first line of defence against
infections. It is non-specific, provides immediate defence against microbes, and helps eliminate damaged cells.
components of Innate Immunity are:
• Epithelial cells - these produce antimicrobial molecules such as alpha-defensins
• Macrophages and neutrophils
• Dendritic cells - these have receptors that sense microbes and cell damage. They stimulate secretion of cytokines, which play important role in inflammation and antiviral defence
• Innate lymphoid cells (ILcs) - these are local tissue lymphocytes that lack T-cell antigen receptors. They produce inflammatory cytokines during the early phases of immune
reactions. Gamma delta T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells belong to this class
• Mast cells
• complement pathway - it include complement proteins of alternative and lectin pathways.",,B,
Q13,which of the following disorders is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern?,"a)Rett syndrome
b)Duchenne muscular dystrophy
c)Huntington disease
d)Tuberous sclerosis","Rett syndrome is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern.
Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder. It is caused due to mutation in the MECP-2 gene. The disorder is mostly seen in girls because affected boys usually die in infancy due to a defective single X chromosome.
Symptoms of Rett syndrome are microcephaly, developmental delay, autistic-like behavior, cognitive dysfunction, seizures, and repetitive motor actions.
other options:
option B: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is inherited in X linked recessive pattern. It occurs due to a mutation in the dystrophin gene. Typical features include calf muscle
pseudohypertrophy and Gower's sign (using arms to lift themselves from a seated position).
Laboratory investigations show elevated serum creatine kinase levels. Casimersen has been recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of DMD.
option C: Huntington's disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It is a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat disorder and shows genetic anticipation (earlier onset of disease or increased
severity in succeeding generations). Patients present with involuntary movements known as chorea. Tetrabenazine is used for treatment.
option D: Tuberous sclerosis also known as Bournville disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It occurs due to mutation in TSC1 and TSC2 genes. It is characterized by subependymal nodules, angiomyolipomas, cafe au lait spots, shagreen patches, and cardiac rhabdomyomas.",,A,
Q14,cell in cell appearance is seen in:,"a)Necrosis
b)Apoptosis
c)Necroptosis
d)Entosis","Cell in cell appearance is seen in entosis.
Entosis is a phenomenon where a cell engulfs a cell of the same type. while cells that are internalised by this mechanism are initially viable. But, the majority of them undergo a
non-apoptotic form of cell death. It plays a physiological role in the elimination of cells detached from a surface.
other options:
option A: Necrosis is a pathologic process of irreversible cell death following severe injury. It is
associated with local inflammation due to damaged cell membranes. Some microscopic features of necrosis are as follows:
• Dilation of mitochondria
• Nuclear changes: karyolysis, pyknosis, and karyorrhexis.
• Myelin figures replacing dead cells.
option B: Apoptosis is a pathway of programmed cell death. In apoptosis, Mitochondrial and    death receptor pathways activate caspases resulting in the formation of apoptotic bodies which are then phagocytosed.



option C: Necroptosis is a type of cell death which is a hybrid of both necrosis and apoptosis. It is also called programmed necrosis/caspase-independent programmed cell death(since it does not      result in caspase activation).",,D,
Q15,Identify the cell marked in the image beloW,"a)Mast cell
b)Macrophage
c)plasma cell
d)Fibroblast","The cell marked in the image is a mast cell stained with toluidine blue. Mast cell granules contain acid proteoglycan that binds basic blue such as toluidine blue.
Mast cells may be difficult to differentiate from lymphocytes in routine, hematoxylin, and
eosin-stained sections, and special metachromatic stains (toluidine blue or Giemsa) are used to visualize their granules.
Mast cells are a part of innate immunity and are widely distributed in connective tissues. They   play an important role in immediate hypersensitivity and both acute and chronic inflammation.
Mast cells express a receptor on their surface that binds to the Fc portion of the IgE antibody.
when an antigen binds to IgE antibodies on the surface of the mast cell, they get activated and degranulate. This results in the release of:
• Granule contents: Histamine, chymase, tryptase, heparin.
• Lipid mediators: Leucotriene C4, D4, prostaglandin D2, platelet-activating factor.
• Cytokines: Tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1
These mediators released from mast cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of immediate/type 1 hypersensitivity.
The image given below shows the sequence of events in immediate (type 1) hypersensitivity.

Q17,How does phagolysosome cause cell death?,"a)Is both intra and extra cellular
b)can fuse with other organelles directly
c)Fuses with lysosome to form autophagolysosome
d)Is a single membrane structure","phagolysosomes cause cell death by the fusion of lysosomes to form autophagolysosomes.
Autophagy is a process in which a cell eats its own contents. Cytoplasmic materials are delivered  and degraded by the lysosome. It is a survival technique of the cell in nutrient deprivation states.
The steps are:
• An isolation membrane called phagophore is formed and nucleated.
• phagophore is derived from the ER with the help of plasma membrane and mitochondria
• A double membrane-bound vesicle is formed from the isolation membrane called the autophagosome
• Maturation of the autophagosome by fusion with lysosomes, called autophagolysosome.
Apoptosis is a regulated mechanism of eliminating unwanted and damaged cells. It is initiated by enzymes called caspases and is executed by two different pathways. The mitochondrial
pathway which is also known as the intrinsic pathway carries out the majority of the apoptosis. The death receptor pathway or the extrinsic pathway is initiated by plasma membrane death
receptors. Both these pathways combine together and activate the caspase cascade which results



in the final phase of apoptosis.
pyroptosis is a form of apoptosis mediated by fever-inducing cytokine IL-1. A multiprotein
complex called inflammasome is activated when microorganisms enter the cell. It will in turn activate caspase 1 which cleaves the IL-1 precursor and releases its biologically active form.",,C,

c)MHC class II deficiency on lymphocytes
d)MHC class I deficiency on lymphocytes","In a patient with bare lymphocytic disease, graft vs host reaction does not occur due to MHC class
II deficiency on the lymphocytes.
Bare lymphocyte disease occurs due to mutations in transcription factors required for class II
MHC gene expression. This results in the lack of class II MHC molecules, leading to the impaired development of CD4+ T cells. As these CD 4+ T cells are required for both for cellular immunity   and for assisting B cells, class II MHC deficiency results in a combined immuno- deficiency.",,C,

c)chronic lymphocytic leukemia
d)Acute myeloid leukemia","A WBC count of 4,5o,ooo/μL with eosinophilia and basophilia indicates a probable diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia.
CML is a myeloproliferative neoplasm. It is caused by the translocation of ABL gene on
chromosome 9 onto BCR gene on chromosome 22, resulting in the formation of the BCR-ABL
fusion gene. This chromosomal abnomality, called philadelphia chromosome, is characteristic of CML.
The resulting BCR-ABL translocation results in the activation of tyrosine kinase that signals pro-growth and pro-survival pathways like RAS and JAk/STAT pathways resulting in the
proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells.

Q24,which of the following molecules helps the leukocytes roll over the endothelial cells in the vessels?,"a)cadherins
b)Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PEcAM-1)
c)E-selectin
d)cd11a","E-selectin, which is present over the endothelium, helps the leukocyte roll over the endothelium.
selectins are of 3 types: L-selectin present on leukocytes, E-selectin present on the endothelium, and P-selectin present in platelets and on the endothelium.
The weak rolling action slows down the leukocytes and allows them to bind more firmly to the endothelium with the help of integrins.
The recruitment of leukocytes to the site of injury involves the following steps:
• Lumen of the vessel to the endothelium:
• Margination: Leukocytes assume a peripheral position along the endothelial surface because of the stasis of blood flow.
• Rolling: Leukocytes start rolling on the vessel wall because of signaling molecules from the endothelium.
• Adhesion: Leukocytes are attached to the endothelium because of adhesion molecules that are activated by cytokines.
• Transmigration of the leukocytes across the vascular endothelium.
• Migration towards a chemotactic stimulus in the extravascular tissues.
other options:
option A: cadherins are a type of glycoprotein cell adhesion molecule that allows cells to adhere together.
option B: Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PEcAM-1), aids in diapedesis, which is the movement of leukocytes through intact endothelium of the capillaries to reach the site of injury.

Q27,which of the following statements are true about hereditary spherocytosis?,"a)Gall stones develop by 4-5 years of age.
b)Splenectomy does not protect against developing gall stones.
c)At least 25 % cases have a family history of HS.
d)High MCH is pathognomonic of HS.","Among the given statements about hereditary spherocytosis, the true statement is option c– at least 25% of cases have a familial inheritance (as 75% of cases show an autosomal dominant     inheritance pattern)
Hereditary spherocytosis is a type of hereditary hemolytic anemia that is mostly inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. some of the cases can be autosomal recessive or
sporadic. Mutations of the red blood cell surface proteins spectrin and ankyrin can result in



unstable cell membranes, leading to hemolysis.
The following mutations have been identified in hereditary spherocytosis:
Autosomal dominant (more common):
• Ankyrin - most common
• Band 3
• β-spectrin
Autosomal recessive:
• α-spectrin
• Band 4.2
This disorder can present at a young age with severe jaundice and fatigue. The unconjugated  hyperbilirubinemia predisposes the patient to develop gallstones in early adulthood. pigment stones are found in 4o-5o% of the affected adults.
Laboratory findings include normocytic anemia with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The peripheral smear will show large spherical red blood cells without central pallor.
MCHC (not, MCH) is increased in hereditary spherocytosis; however, it is not pathognomonic as it could be found in other conditions as well. MCV is mildly decreased because of cell
shrinkage. There is mild to moderate anemia, therefore, MCH could be slightly lower.
The diagnosis can be confirmed by the acid glycerol lysis test and the eosin-5,-maleimide (EMA)–binding test.
There is no specific treatment available besides splenectomy. spleen is the major site where
spherocytes undergo hemolysis. Hence, splenectomy corrects the anemia and its associated
complications, thereby playing a role in preventing gallstones. It is done at 4–6 years of age in   severe cases and after puberty in moderate cases. It should be followed up with the appropriate antibiotic and vaccine prophylaxis.",,C,
Q28,B cells express IgM and IgD antibodies at the same time due to which phenomenon?,"a)Somatic hypermutation
b)Alternative RNA splicing
c)Affinity maturation
d)Allelic exclusion","B cells express IgM and IgD antibodies at the same time due to alternative RNA splicing.
Alternative RNA splicing is the process by which different proteins are produced from the same RNA transcript by splicing it in different ways.
Mature circulating B cells initially express IgM and IgD antibodies on their surfaces before they
are stimulated to produce specific antibodies. The heavy chains in IgM and IgD are mu (μ)
and delta (δ), respectively. The mu and delta genes for these heavy chains are located proximal to  the VDJ encoding regions (i.e., variable, diversity, and joining regions) of the heavy chain locus. A primary RNA transcript of this entire region is produced, which then undergoes alternative RNA   processing, enabling the production of both transmembrane IgM and IgD on B cells.
other options:
options A and C: somatic hypermutation is a cellular response by which the immune system
adapts to the new foreign elements that confront it. They do so by adding nucleotides in V gene



regions of heavy and light chains, resulting in a better fit of antigen with the antibodies. This
hence increases the affinity of antibodies to antigens. Due to this, the subset of plasma cells with these improved hypervariable regions are more strongly selected by the antigen and therefore
constitute a larger part of the population of antibody-producing cells. This process is called affinity maturation.
option D: Allelic exclusion is the process by which a cell expresses one of the two alleles of the gene and excludes the other allele.
B cells are diploid, therefore, each B cell has six gene segment pools related to antibody chains:
• Two heavy-chain pools (one from each parent) and
• Four light-chain pools (one κ and one λ from each parent).
However, each B cell uses only two of the six gene segment pools: one out of the two heavy-chain pools (maternal and paternal) and one out of the four light-chain pools. Thus, each B cell must     choose not only between its κ and λ light-chain pools but also between its maternal and paternal  light-chain and heavy-chain pools. This process of choosing is by allelic exclusion.",,B,

• Inhibit metabolic activity
• Reduce apoptosis
• stimulate protein folding
• Inhibit the harmful effects of oxygen-free radicals
• Increase insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism (maybe targeted for the treatment of diabetes)
• Ensure that damaged DNA is not propagated, preventing the accumulation of mutations

TH1 cells secrete:
• IL-2 which activates natural killer cells (NK cells) and cytotoxic T cells
• IFN gamma which stimulates macrophages and is also responsible for delayed hypersensitivity along with TGF beta.
TH2 cells secrete:
• IL- 4 stimulates IgE production from B cells
• IL- 5 stimulates proliferation of eosinophils and together play a role in helminthic and allergic reactions

b)squamous cell carcinoma
c)Large cell carcinoma
d)small cell carcinoma","The clinical scenario of a lung tumor associated with chronic smoking and tumor cells staining positive for chromogranin indicates that the most likely diagnosis in this patient is small cell     carcinoma of the lung.



small cell carcinoma of the lung belongs to the neuroendocrine tumors and originates
from neuroendocrine progenitor cells, kulchitsky cells that line the bronchial epithelium. It is a    highly malignant tumor with a high association with cigarette smoking. It usually arises from the major bronchi.
Histopathology of small cell lung carcinoma shows clusters of small cells which are round, oval, or spindle-shaped, and a prominent nuclear molding. These cells have scant cytoplasm, ill-defined
cell borders, finely granular nuclear chromatin (salt and pepper pattern), and absent or
inconspicuous nucleoli. The Azzopardi effect is described as basophilic staining of vascular walls due to coating by DNA from necrotic tumor cells.
Neuroendocrine markers seen in small cell lung carcinoma include:
• Chromogranin
• synaptophysin
• CD56
paraneoplastic syndromes associated with small cell carcinoma of the lung are Cushing syndrome due to ACTH production and hyponatremia due to inappropriate ADH secretion. small cell lung    cancer-associated sIADH is due to the ectopic release of antidiuretic hormone. It is associated
with increased thirst and hyponatremia.

d)Large cell carcinoma","The given clinical history and the histopathological findings showing keratin pearls are suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.
squamous cell carcinoma is most commonly found in men and is strongly associated with smoking.
squamous cell carcinoma predominantly arises in the central segmental or subsegmental
bronchi. The tumor may grow into the bronchial lumen and produce an intraluminal mass. In



certain cases, the bronchial obstruction may lead to atelectasis or infection. The tumor may
penetrate the wall of the bronchus and infiltrate the peribronchial tissue into the carina or the mediastinum.
This tumor may be associated with paraneoplastic syndromes like hypercalcemia. The symptoms could include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, lethargy, polyuria, polydipsia, and
dehydration.

• Deletion of 11q
• Trisomy 12q
• Deletion of 17p (poor prognosis)
It is usually asymptomatic at diagnosis but can present with easy fatigability, weight loss, and anorexia. Generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are usually seen.
Total blood count:
• Total leukocyte count is highly variable; leukopenia is seen when the marrow is involved.
• Hypogammaglobulinemia is common and contributes to increased susceptibility to infections.
• 1o% to 15% of patients develop hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia due to autoantibodies made by non-neoplastic B cells.
Findings of peripheral smear:
• Predominantly shows small lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm.

b)1 and 4
c)2 and 3
d)3 and 4","The true statements about familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are statements 2 and 4 (option-
A).
Familial adenomatous polyposis is an inherited autosomal dominant disorder presenting
numerous colorectal adenomatous polyps. It is an autosomal dominant disease caused by
mutations in the APC gene, which is a regulator in the wnt signaling pathway. The diagnosis of FAP requires the presence of at least 1oo polyps.
Patients are usually teenagers and multiple polyps are visible in the colon during sigmoidoscopy.   It is associated with a variety of extraintestinal manifestations including congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigmental epithelium. Colorectal adenocarcinoma occurs in almost all cases before the  age of 5o.
Prophylactic colectomy is recommended in patients with APC gene mutations. The surgeries used are colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA), restorative proctocolectomy with an ileal
pouch-anal anastomosis (RPC), or total proctectomy and end ileostomy. The first 2 surgeries are preferred in young patients as it avoids a permanent stoma.
Note - FAP along with brain tumors is called Turcot syndrome. FAP along with multiple osteomas, skin, and soft tissue tumors is called Gardner syndrome.",,A,
Q38,which of the following shows maximum amplitude on thromboelastography?,"a)platelet
b)Intrinsic
c)Extrinsic
d)vwD","The maximum amplitude in thromboelastography represents platelets. A decrease in maximum amplitude signifies a quantitative or qualitative deficiency of platelets.
Thromboelastography (TEG) is a non-invasive test that quantifies the ability of whole blood to
form a clot. It is useful in intraoperative coagulation status assessment. The dynamic changes in     the viscoelastic properties of a blood sample during the clotting can be detected and quantified by  thromboelastography. underlying coagulation deficiencies show different shapes in the TEG. They are shown in the image below:






Advantages ofthromboelastography:
•
Blood coagulability, including coagulation cascade, platelet function, and fibrinolysis can be assessed.
•
It is a simple bedside test
•
can diagnose coagulopathic bleeding
•
can be used as a guide in transfusion therapy and decrease the use of blood products

Q39,"A man presented with fever, night sweats, and weight loss for 2 months. on examination,    non-tender, rubbery lymph nodes were palpable in the supraclavicular and inguinal regions on both sides. peripheral smear showed the presence ofbi-nucleated cells. which markers   will be seen in this condition?","a)1, 2, 4
b)2, 3, 4
c)2 and 3
d)1 and 2","The probable diagnosis from the given clinical scenario and the histopathological description
is Hodgkin's lymphoma. The bi-nucleated cells are called the Reed-sternberg cells which are cD 15+ and cD3o+ (option D- 1 and 2).
Hodgkin's lymphoma arises in a single lymph node or chain of nodes and spreads first to
anatomically contiguous lymphoid tissues. It usually presents as painless lymphadenopathy. The distinctive feature of Hodgkin's lymphoma is the presence of Reed-sternberg cells.
WHO classifies Hodgkin's lymphoma into 5 subtypes:



• Nodular sclerosis: Frequent lacunar cells
• Mixed cellularity
• Lymphocyte-rich
• Lymphocyte depletion
• Nodular lymphocyte predominance
The first 4 subtypes are considered classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. The RS cells are CD 15+ and    CD3o+. The lymphocyte predominant type is considered non-classical Hodgkin's lymphoma with CD15-, CD3o-, CD2o+, and EB -.

Reed-sternberg cell (Rs cell) is the characteristic tumor giant cell of Hodgkin Lymphoma. It is
derived from the germinal or post-germinal center B cell. It has a classic owl-eyed appearance due to the presence of a symmetric or mirror-image bilobed nucleus, with prominent nucleoli
surrounded by a clear space. It has the following variants:
• Lacunar
• classic
• L&amp;H popcorn cells
• pleomorphic
• Mononuclear
Rs cells should be present in a background of non-neoplastic inflammatory cells like lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils, to make a diagnosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
The image given below shows the diagnostic Reed-sternberg cell, with two nuclear lobes, large    inclusion-like nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm, surrounded by lymphocytes, macrophages, and an eosinophil.

Q40,"A 1o-year-old boy presented with fatigue. Investigations revealed: Hemoglobin, 9 g/dL; MCV, 6o fL; MCH, 2o pg; and serum ferritin, 185 μg/L. The TLC was elevated and showed
predominant lymphocytes and neutrophils. what is the likely diagnosis in this patient?","a)Thalassemia
b)Anemia of chronic disorder
c)Iron-deficiency anemia
d)sickle cell anemia","The given clinical scenario and the investigation findings are suggestive of microcytic
hypochromic anemia. The most likely diagnosis in this patient is anemia of chronic disorder.
Anemia of chronic disorders more commonly presents as normochromic normocytic anemia that later develops into microcytic hypochromic anemia rarely. It is caused due to production of
erythrocytes.
Anemia of chronic disease is anemia resulting due to chronic diseases which produce systemic inflammation. During chronic inflammation, inflammatory mediators like interleukin - 6
(IL-6) stimulate the production of hepcidin from the liver. Hepcidin is an acute phase
reactant that inhibits ferroportin on macrophages and also decreases transport of iron from stores to developing RBC precursors. This results in decreased proliferation of erythroid progenitors due to impaired iron utilization.
other options:
option B: Thalassemia also presents as iron deficiency anemia but it does not have elevated luekocytosis.
option C: Iron deficiency anemia also presents as microcytic hypochromic anemia. But since there is deficient iron, the serum ferritin level will also be low. This patient has normal serum ferritin
and hence does not have iron deficiency anemia.
Note:
MCV/RBC count (Mentzer index) can also be used to distinguish thalassemia from iron-deficiency anemia (IDA). MCV (mean corpuscular volume) and MCH (mean corpuscular hemoglobin) are
low in both IDA and thalassemia. RBC count may be normal in thalassemia, whereas it is reduced in IDA. A lower RBC count in IDA means the denominator is smaller, yielding a greater MCV/RBC ratio.



option D: sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in β-globin that creates sickle hemoglobin (Hbs). It does not present as microcytic hypochromic anemia.",,B,
Q41,senile atrophy occurs due to ______.,"a)Denervation
b)Decreased nutrition
c)Decreased workload
d)Reduced blood supply","senile atrophy is seen when there is a reduced blood supply to a tissue. This reduction in the    blood supply occurs in a gradual manner because of slowly progressing atherosclerotic lesions.
Atrophy is a process of reduction in the size of a tissue or an organ resulting from a decrease in   the cell size and number. It is a type of cellular adaptation. In this process, there is a decrease in the synthesis of cellular proteins and an increase in their degradation, mainly mediated by the     ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Atrophy can either be physiological or pathological:
physiologic atrophy:
• Loss of hormonal stimulation: Atrophy of the uterus after parturition; atrophy of the endometrium, vaginal epithelium, and breast after menopause.
• During embryonic development: Certain structures, like the notochord and thyroglossal duct, undergo atrophy during fetal development.
pathologic atrophy:
• Disuse Atrophy (decreased workload): e.g., atrophy in a limb that has been immobilized following a fracture
• Denervation atrophy (loss of nerve supply): e.g., skeletal muscle atrophy following nerve injury
• Ischemic atrophy: e.g., senile atrophy of the brain and heart due to atherosclerosis
• Inadequate nutrition: e.g., severe muscle wasting in marasmus
• pressure atrophy: e.g., atrophy of surrounding uninvolved tissues caused by an enlarging benign tumor",,D,
Q42,Cyclooxygenase plays a role in which pathway?,"a)Kreb's cycle
b)prostaglandin
c)Leukotriene
d)vitamin K","prostaglandins are produced from arachidonic acid present in the membrane phospholipids. This process is mediated by 2 cyclooxygenases: Cox-1 and Cox-2. prostaglandins are produced by
mast cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells.
Cox-1 is commonly found in most tissues. It plays a role in maintaining normal homeostasis. It is also induced by inflammatory stimuli.
Cox-2 is found in cells that are involved in inflammatory reactions.
The most important prostaglandins in inflammation are pGE2, pGD2, pGF2a, pGI2
(prostacyclin), and thromboxane A2.
other options:
options A: kreb's cycle is also called the citric acid cycle and tricarboxylic acid cycle. It is the terminal pathway for the oxidative catabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acids.

Q43,"Metastatic calcification can be explained by all, except ______.","a)Renal failure
b)Accumulation of calcium phosphate
c)vitamin D deficiency
d)parathyroid activation/ secretion","Metastatic calcification cannot be explained by vitamin D deficiency. Metastatic calcification is associated with hypercalcemia, which may be caused by vitamin D intoxication rather than
deficiency.
pathologic calcification is the abnormal tissue deposition of calcium salts, together with smaller amounts of iron, magnesium, and other mineral salts. It is of two types namely metastatic and   dystrophic calcification.
Metastatic calcification is the deposition of calcium salts in otherwise normal tissues.
• Hypercalcemia secondary to some disturbance in calcium metabolism.
• principal causes of hypercalcemia:
• Increased secretion of parathyroid hormone (pTH)
• Resorption of bone tissue
• vitamin-D-related disorders- excess or abnormal sensitivity
• Renal failure
• Aluminum intoxication

c)1-C;2-B;3-D;4-A
d)1-D;2-A;3-B;4-C","The correct answer is option B:
Cytokines are proteins produced by many cell types (principally activated lymphocytes,
macrophages, and dendritic cells, but also endothelial, epithelial, and connective tissue cells) that mediate and regulate immune and inflammatory reactions.
Three subsets of CD4+ T cells secrete different types of cytokines and elicit different types of inflammation.
TH1 cells - activate macrophages by the classical pathway by secreting IFNγ.
TH2 cells - recruit and activate eosinophils and are responsible for the alternative pathway of macrophage activation by secreting IL4, IL5, and IL13.
• IL4 acts on B cells to stimulate class switching to IgE and promotes the development of additional TH2 cells.
• IL5 is involved in the development and activation of eosinophils, which are essential effectors of type I hypersensitivity



(discussed later).
• IL13 enhances IgE production and acts on epithelial cells to stimulate mucus secretion. In
addition, TH2 cells (as well as mast cells and epithelial cells) produce chemokines that attract  more TH2 cells, as well as other leukocytes, to the reaction site. It also shares some functional similarities to IL-4 and can thus induce differentiation in dendritic cells.
TH17 cells secrete IL17 and other cytokines responsible for neutrophils and monocyte recruitment.

d)Anaplastic carcinoma of thyroid","The histopathological image shows the presence of amyloid-rich stroma (pinkish material) and nests of polygonal cells, which are findings suggestive of medullary carcinoma of thyroid.


Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MTC) arises from the parafollicular C cells. Most of the MTC are sporadic, but they may also be associated with inheritable syndromes like familial
MTC, MEN2A, and MEN2B. All the inherited variants are secondary to RET gene mutations.
Most patients present at 5o–6o years and have a female preponderance. MTC secretes calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), prostaglandins E2 and F2α , histaminase, serotonin,
and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH).



Features of MTC
• painful neck mass with cervical lymphadenopathy
• Dysphagia, dysphonia, or dyspnea if there is local invasion
• Diarrhea due to increased intestinal motility
• Cushingoid habitus due to ectopic ACTH production
• Blood-borne metastasis
• Microscopically, they consist of sheets of neoplastic cells separated by collagen and amyloid stroma
Diagnosis is by careful family history, physical examination, raised calcitonin and CEA levels, and fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the mass.

c)Langerhans cell histiocytosis
d)Juvenile Xanthogranuloma","The above clinical scenario along with the histopathological image showing Langerhans cells with folded nuclei (image A), CD1a (image B), and positive S1oo (image C), is suggestive of
Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH).
LCH occurs due to the proliferation of a special type of immature dendritic cells,
called Langerhans cells. Their normal function is to present antigens. The most common mutation is the BRAFv6ooE gain-of-function mutation.
It is characterized by single or multiple osteolytic bone lesions and can also infiltrate nearly every organ, like the skin (of the scalp), lungs, liver, spleen, bone marrow, or the central nervous
system.
LCH can present as the following clinical entities:
• Multifocal multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis (Letterer-Siwe disease) - mostly seen in infants



• unifocal and multifocal unisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis (eosinophilic granuloma) - The combination of bone defects, diabetes insipidus, and exophthalmos is called
the Hand-schüller-Christian triad - mostly seen in younger children
• pulmonary LCH - mostly seen in adults
Clinical features include pain and swelling in the affected area. when calvarium is affected, it
results in otitis media and mastoiditis. spinal involvement results in compression fractures and
neurological involvement. vertebral involvement results in a rapid flattening of the vertebral body (vertebra plana).
Histopathologically, Langerhans cells have a single large nucleus with a characteristic folded or
grooved nucleus (coffee-bean appearance) with small inconspicuous nucleoli. Birbeck granules are
seen in the cytoplasm. The tumor cells specifically express HLA-DR, s-100, and CD1a and langerin (CD207) markers.

Q50,Hereditary angioedema is due to a defect in which of the proteins mentioned below?,"a)C1 inhibitor
b)Decay accelerating factor
c)CD59
d)C5 convertase","Hereditary angioedema is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by a deficiency of C1     esterase inhibitors. C1 esterase inhibitors usually target proteases like C1r and C1s, factor XII and the kallikrein system. Therefore, their deficiency leads to unregulated activation of kallikrein,
leading to increased bradykinin.
Clinical features include swelling of the skin and mucosal surfaces, nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea, which may be aggravated after minor trauma or emotional stress. The condition can be treated by giving C1 inhibitor concentrates from human plasma.
The main inflammatory mediator responsible for these symptoms is bradykinin. Bradykinin is an inflammatory mediator formed by the cleavage of kininogen, in the presence of the enzyme
kallikrein. Bradykinin has the following effects:
• Increases the vascular permeability
• Causes contraction of smooth muscle
• Dilates the blood vessel
• Mediates pain
other options:
options B and C: Decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and CD59 are two proteins that are linked by a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor to the plasma membrane. DAF prevents the formation of C3 convertases and CD59 inhibits the formation of the MAC. An acquired deficiency of the
enzyme that creates GPI anchors leads to a deficiency of these regulators and excessive
complement activation and lysis of red cells resulting in Paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinuria(PNH).
During inflammation, C5a (option D), C3a, and C4a, which are all cleavage products of their
corresponding complement components, stimulate mast cells to release histamine. They have
effects similar to those of mast cell mediators involved in anaphylactic reactions and therefore, are



called anaphylatoxins. C5a is also chemotactic for neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and
basophils. Additionally, it activates the lipooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism in neutrophils and monocytes, resulting in the further release of inflammatory mediators.",,A,

d)Essential thrombocytosis","The given scenario of a 35 year old woman, her iron profile and peripheral smear showing microcytic hypochromic anemia are suggestive of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA).
IDA is an example of microcytic hypochromic anemia. The causes of IDA can be inadequate diet, impaired reabsorption, increased requirement and increased blood loss.
The manifestations of IDA depend upon the underlying cause. In general, IDA presents with    koilonychia, alopecia, atrophic changes in the tongue, gastric mucosa, malabsorbtion and pica (craving for consumption of non-edible materials)
peripheral smears show small and pale red cells typically described as microcytic (reduced MCV) and hypochromic (enlarged zone of central pallor). poikilocytosis can be seen in the form of
elongated red cells, known as pencil cells. Target cells can be found in cases of severe IDA.
Diagnosis is mainly by laboratory studies. The typical findings are:
• Low hemoglobin and hematocrit
• Low serum iron and ferretin
• Increased Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC)
• Hepcidin is low (decreased stores of iron inhibit hepcidin synthesis)
IDA is treated by giving oral and parenteral preparations if iron or packed cell transfusion depending upon the severity of the anemia.

The majority express TTF-1, which is a protein required for normal lung development. Napsin A is a new marker and is more sensitive and specific than TTF-1 in the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.
Adenocarcinomas grow in various patterns: acinar, lepidic, papillary, micropapillary, and solid.
The lesions are small and are usually located in the periphery.  At the periphery of the tumor there is often a lepidic pattern of spread, in which the tumor cells “crawl” along normal-appearing
alveolar septa.

Multiple lesions occur on the skin and mucous membranes, with a predilection for the trunk and  anogenital areas. Individual lesions are firm, pruritic, pink to skin-colored umbilicated papules. A curd-like material can be expressed from the central umbilication.
smearing this material onto a glass slide followed by Giemsa staining shows diagnostic
molluscum bodies, which are ellipsoid, homogeneous, cytoplasmic inclusion bodies that are found in the cells of the stratum granulosum and the stratum corneum and are up to 35 μm in size.
The image below shows umbilicated papules of molluscum contagiosum.



other options:
option A: Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a condition characterized by painless erythematous
papules on the face with folliculocentric keratin spines. It is caused by trichodysplasia
spinulosa-associated polyomavirus. Histologic features are keratin plugging, abundant dystrophic



and cornfield inner root sheath epithelium, and numerous, large eosinophilic trichohyalin granules.
option B: koilocytes are characteristically seen in HPV infections, such as condylomata  acuminata. koilocytes are lining cells which have perinuclear cytoplasmic vacuolization.
option D: Donovan bodies are seen in donovanosis, caused by klebsiella granulomatis. Donovan bodies are minute, encapsulated coccobacilli in macrophages, which can be demonstrated in
Giemsa-stained smears ofthe exudate.",2105-1360.PNG,C,
Q57,Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is caused by all of the following cytokines except:,"a)TNF alpha
b)IL-6
c)IL-8
d)INF- γ","INF-γ is not involved in Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (JHR).
JHR is a condition that occurs in patients infected by spirochetes who undergo antibiotic
treatment. The reaction occurs within 24 hours of antibiotic treatment. clinical features are fever, chills, nausea and vomiting, tachycardia, hypotension, flushing, myalgia, and exacerbation of skin lesions.
syphilis is the leading spirochetal infection associated with JHR. other infections are Lyme
disease, louse-borne relapsing fever, leptospirosis, and tick-borne relapsing fever. Antibiotics that have been most associated are penicillins, tetracyclines, and erythromycin.
Mild reactions are self-limiting and often resolve spontaneously within 24 hours. Prevention of the JHR is by giving TNF-alpha antibodies and in some cases steroids.",,D,
