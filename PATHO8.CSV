Q1,what is the cell of origin of chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia/small Lymphocytic Lymphoma?,"a)Mature B cells
b)Mature T cells
c)progenitor T cells
d)Naive B cells","The cell of origin of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL)/ Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) is either naive B cells or post-germinal centre memory B cell.
The CLL and SLL differ only in the degree of peripheral blood lymphocytes. CLL is the most
common leukemia of adults in the western world. The median age of diagnosis is 6o years. The
most common genetic anomalies seen are deletions of 13q14.3, 11q, and 17p and trisomy 12q. Loss of tumor suppressor genes in chromosome 13 results in overexpression of the anti-apoptotic
protein BCL2.
The growth of CLL/SLL cells is confined to the proliferation centers (pathognomonic for
CLL/SLL), where the tumor cells receive critical factors from the surrounding environments, such as NF-κB for cell survival, MYC for cell growth, Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) signaling pathway, etc.,
The tumor cells express CD19, CD2o, CD23, and CD5. Smudge cells are also characteristic of
CLL. Clinical features include easy fatiguability, weight loss, anorexia, generalized
lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, hemolytic anemia, etc. CLL/SLL has a tendency to transform to a more aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  - this is called Richter syndrome.
Factors with a bad prognosis include:
• Presence of deletions of 11q and  17p.
• Lack of somatic hypermutation.
• Expression of ZAP-7o, a protein that augments signals produced by the Ig receptor.
• Presence of NOTCH1 mutations
BTK inhibitors and BCL2 inhibitors produce sustained therapeutic responses in a higher fractions of people with CLL/SLL.",,D,
Q2,Human papilloma virus inactivates RB gene by which of the following proteins?,"a)E6
b)E7
c)L1
d)L2","E7 protein of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) binds to the hypophosphorylated RB protein and displaces the E2F transcription factors, thereby promoting G1/S transition.
RB gene is a key negative regulator of the cell cycle at the G1/S transition. RB gene exists in an   active hypophosphorylated state in resting cells and in an inactive hyperphosphorylated state in cells undergoing G1/S transition.
E7 protein from the high-risk types of HPV (such as HPV 16) binds to the hypophosphorylated RB through the same pocket that RB uses to bind and sequester the E2F transcription factors, thereby



displacing the E2F which leads to the progression of the cell cycle and thus the proliferation of tumor cells. E7 proteins also inactivate the CDK inhibitors p21 and p27. E7 proteins from
high-risk HPVs (types 16,18 and 31) also bind and presumably activates cyclins  A and E.
oncogenic activities of protein E6:
The E6 protein binds to and helps in the degradation of p53 and stimulates the expression of  telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), which is the catalytic subunit of telomerase, thereby helping in the longevity of the cells. E6 from high-risk HPV types has a higher affinity for p53 than E6 from low-risk types.",,B,2012-1274.PNG
Q3,"In cystic fibrosis, which of the following structure is affected in pancreas?","a)A
b)B
c)C
d)D","The part labeled ‘B’ in the image is the exocrine pancreas which is affected in cystic fibrosis. Features of cystic fibrosis in the pancreas:
• Accumulation of mucus in the ducts leads to dilation of exocrine glands.
• Complete blockage of ducts with mucus leads to atrophy of the exocrine pancreas and progressive fibrosis
• Due to atrophy, there will be loss of exocrine secretions, which in turn leads to impaired absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins
• Associated loss of vitamin A leads to squamous metaplasia of the pancreatic duct lining epithelium

Q4,Mediators involved in the early phase of type 1 hypersensitivity are?,"a)1, 5
b)1, 2, 3, 4,
c)1, 2, 4, 5
d)2, 3, 4","The mediators involved in the early phase of type 1 hypersensitivity are,
• Mast cells,
• Histamine,
• prostaglandins (D2) and
• Leukotrienes (C4 and D4).
Early phase of type 1 hypersensitivity:
The mediators produced by the mast cells are responsible for most of the immediate
hypersensitivity reactions. Histamine and leukotrienes are released rapidly from the sensitized    mast cells and trigger intense immediate reactions characterized by edema, mucus secretion and smooth muscle spasm.
other mediators involved in the early phase are,
• Enzymes: neutral proteases (chymase, tryptase) and acid hydrolases
• proteoglycans: heparin and chondroitin sulfate
• Lipid mediators: platelet-activating factor (pAF)
Late-phase of type 1 hypersensitivity:



The late phase reaction is characterized by the recruitment of leukocytes, that amplify and sustain the inflammatory response without exposure to the triggering antigen.
Mediators involved in the late phase of type 1 hypersensitivity reaction are:
• cytokines: TNF, IL-1, IL-4, IL-5, and chemokines (eotaxin)
• Leukocytes (eosinophils)
• Major Basic Protein (MBP)
• Eosinophil cationic protein",,C,2014-1276.PNG
Q5,"Given below is an image of activation of the coagulation cascade, following closed endothelial injury. Identify the factor ‘L’ which combines with tissue factor to activate factor IX.","a)Factor XII
b)Factor VII
c)Factor VIII
d)vWF","The factor marked as ‘L’ is factor VII, which combines with tissue factor that is produced following a close endothelial injury to activate factor Ix.
As the image represents the in vivo coagulation cascade, the tissue factor is the major initiator of coagulation. It is believed that in vivo, factor VIIa/tissue factor complex is the most important
activator of factor Ix and that factor Ixa/factor VIIIa complex is the most important activator of factor x.
Tissue factor is expressed on the surfaces of the subendothelial cellular components of the vessel wall, such as smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. This tissue factor is exposed to blood when
there is a vascular damage. This activates the in vivo extrinsic pathway of coagulation cascade, which is as follows:
• Tissue factor binds with serine protease factor VIIa
• This complex then activates factor Ix to factor Ixa
• Factor Ixa then activates factor x to factor xa
• Factor xa can be formed through the actions of either the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex or factor Ixa (with factor VIIIa as cofactor)



• Factor Xa then converts prothrombin to thrombin, which is the pivotal protease of the coagulation cascade.
• The cofactor essential for this conversion is factor va.
• The thrombin then formed converts the soluble plasma fibrinogen to an insoluble fibrin matrix.
• Thrombin also activates factor XIII, which is the fibrin stabilizing factor, to factor XIIIa. This factor XIIIa forms covalent cross-links and thereby stabilizes the fibrin clot.

Q7,Arrange the following cellular events of inflammation in the correct sequence:,"a)1, 2, 3, 4
b)2, 1, 4, 3
c)4, 1, 2, 3
d)3, 4, 1, 2","The correct sequence of cellular events that occurs during inflammation is as follows: Rolling, cytokine-mediated integrin activation, Adhesion, Migration.
The recruitment of leucocytes to the site of inflammation is a multi-step process that is mediated by adhesion molecules and cytokines called chemokines. This process can be divided into
sequential phases:
• In the lumen: margination, rolling and adhesion to the endothelium occurs.
• Migration of the leucocytes across the endothelium and vessel wall
• Migration in the tissues towards a chemotactic stimulus.
The process of leucocyte recruitment is as follows:
• Margination: Because of the dilation of the inflamed postcapillary venues, there is stasis of blood flow, and hence, more leucocytes assume a peripheral position along the endothelial surface; this   process of leucocyte redistribution is called margination.
• Rolling: The slowed down leucocytes then sense the signals from the endothelium and start rolling on the vessel wall.
• cytokine-mediated integrin activation: The attachment of leucocytes to the endothelial cells requires adhesion molecules that are activated by cytokines. The major families of proteins     involved in adhesion and migration are selectins and integrins and their ligands.
• Adhesions: The weak rolling interactions slow down the leucocytes and allow them to bind more firmly to the endothelium. chemokines that were produced at the site of injury bind to the
endothelial cell proteoglycans. These chemokines then bind to the rolling leucocytes and activate   them. This, in turn, converts the ligands for β1 and β2 integrins, VLA-4, and LFA-1 present on the leucocytes to a high-affinity state.
• This combination of cytokine-induced expression of integrin ligands on the endothelium and increased integrin affinity on the leucocytes leads to firm adhesion of leucocytes to the
endothelium at the site of inflammation.
• Leucocyte migration: This is the movement of leucocytes through the intact endothelium, called transmigration or diapedesis. This occurs in postcapillary venules. This migration occurs through the inter-endothelial gap towards the chemical concentration gradient created by the chemokines at the site of injury. This occurs with the help of adhesion molecules present in the intercellular    junctions such as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PEcAM-1) or cD31.",,A,2017-1278.PNG
Q8,which of the following is used in the treatment of sideroblastic anemia?,"a)vitamin B12
b)vitamin B6
c)vitamin B1
d)Iron","vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is used in the treatment of sideroblastic anaemia.
pyridoxine 2oomg per day for 2-3 months is administered routinely to all cases of sideroblastic anaemia. This cofactor is essential for ALA-synthase activity, and mutations in the pyridoxine
binding site of the enzyme have been found in several responsive patients. Blood transfusion and other supportive therapy are also indicated. In cases of secondary sideroblastic anaemia, the
primary focus is the removal of the offending agent. But no definitive treatment is available for hereditary and idiopathic types of sideroblastic anaemia.
sideroblasts are nucleated red cells (normoblasts) containing siderotic granules which stain
positively with prussian blue stain. Based on aetiology, sideroblastic anaemia are classified into hereditary and acquired types.
Hereditary sideroblastic anaemia is an X-linked disorder caused due to a defect in the activity of    aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthetase required for heme synthesis. Affected females act as carriers while males have moderate to marked anaemia and manifest in childhood or during early
adulthood
Acquired sideroblastic anaemia:
I) primary acquired:
• Also called idiopathic or refractory acquired sideroblastic anaemia
• occurs in middle-aged and older individuals of both sexes
• Due to the reduced activity of the enzyme ALA synthetase, there is disturbed growth and maturation of the erythroid precursors at the level of hematopoietic stem cell
• Moderate to severe anaemia, which appears insidiously
• Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia may also be seen



• Regarded as a myelodysplastic disorder in the FAB classification and thus considered preleukaemic
II) secondary acquired:
May appear secondary to
• Drugs, chemicals and toxins: Isoniazid, Cycloserine, Chloramphenicol, Cyclophosphamide, Alcohol, Lead, etc.,
• Haematological disorders: myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, acute leukaemia, myeloma, lymphoma and hemolytic anaemia.
• Miscellaneous: Carcinoma, myxoedema, rheumatoid arthritis and sLE.
Laboratory findings:
• peripheral smear: Hypochromic, microcytic (sometimes normocytic) anaemia
• Absolute values: MCV, MCH and MCHC are reduced except in acquired type, where MCV is raised.
• Bone marrow: Erythroid hyperplasia with macronormoblastic erythropoiesis. Marrow iron stores are raised. pathognomonic ring sideroblasts are present.
• serum ferritin: Raised
• serum iron: Raised
• TIBC: Normal
• Haemoglobin electrophoresis: Normal",,B,
Q9,A 5-year-old child who presented with proptosis of one of the eyes was found to have a desmin positive tumour. what is the probable diagnosis?,"a)Ewing’s sarcoma
b)Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma
c)Leukemia
d)Retinoblastoma","The clinical picture of a 5-year-old child with proptosis and a desmin positive tumor suggests a diagnosis of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.
Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant mesenchymal tumor with skeletal muscle differentiation.
There are four subtypes: alveolar, embryonal, pleomorphic, and spindle
cell/sclerosing. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood and adolescence and is usually of the alveolar and the embryonal variety. pleomorphic
rhabdomyosarcoma is seen predominantly in adults. spindle cell/sclerosing type affects all ages. The pediatric forms often arise in the sinuses, head and neck, and genitourinary tract.
Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma has sheets of both primitive round and spindled cells in a myxoid stroma. Rhabdomyoblasts with visible cross-striations may be present. sarcoma botryoids is
a variant of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma in the walls of hollow, mucosal-lined structures, such as the nasopharynx, common bile duct, bladder, and vagina with cambium layer. Alveolar
rhabdomyosarcoma has a network of fibrous septae that divide the cells into clusters or
aggregates, creating a crude resemblance to pulmonary alveoli.
Clinically, the tumor is usually aggressive, with unilateral proptosis when the orbit is involved. swelling and redness of the overlying skin, diplopia may be present. Immunohistochemistry is positive for desmin, myoglobin, myogenin, MyoD1, and vimentin



Treatment involves surgical resection and chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. The best prognosis is for the botryoid variant while the pleomorphic has variant has the worst prognosis.

Q10,"A 17-year-old boy presented with intussusception and was taken up for surgery. He was found to have multiple polyps. The resected section was sent for histopathology and the whole
mount image of the specimen is given below. Identify the lesion.","a)Tubulovillous adenoma
b)Hamartomatous polyp
c)Adenocarcinoma
d)Hyperplastic polyp","The given clinical feature of intussusception and multiple polyps and the histologic picture
showing an arborizing pattern of connective tissue, smooth muscle, lamina propria, and glands   are suggestive of peutz–Jeghers syndrome, which is a type of hamartomatous polyp of the small intestine.
It is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by hamartomatous polyps of the intestinal tract and melanosis of the mouth and the lips.
Clinical features:
• Hamartomatous polyps of the intestinal tract
• Hyperpigmentation of the buccal mucosa, lips, perianal skin, and digits
• Increased (2% to 1o%) risk for cancer of the intestinal tract, with cancers reported throughout the intestinal tract, from the stomach to the rectum.
• Increased risk for extraintestinal malignant neoplasms, including cancer of the breast, ovary, cervix, fallopian tubes, thyroid, lung, gallbladder, bile ducts, pancreas, and testicles.
Management:
• surgery is indicated in cases where there are bleeding, obstruction, intussusception, or adenomatous changes of the polyp.
• If surgery is done for these indications attempts should be made to remove as much as polyps as possible.
• Regular screening with endoscopic studies should be done due to the increased risk of malignancies.
• screening of other malignancies like breast and cervix are also important.
other options:
A) Tubulovillous adenoma:
These are a mixture of tubular and villous adenoma and consist of small, pedunculated polyps   composed of rounded or tubular glands and larger, sessile polyps which are covered by slender  villi. These adenomas are characterized microscopically by the presence of epithelial dysplasia.  The hallmarks of epithelial dysplasia are nuclear hyperchromasia, elongation and stratification.





C) Adenocarcinoma:
presents with occult bleeding, changes in bowel habits, or cramping and left lower quadrant
discomfort. Morphologically, they present as polypoid, exophytic masses or annular lesions that
produce ‘napkin-ring’ construction and luminal narrowing. Microscopically, these tumours consist of tall columnar cells with elongated, hyperchromatic nuclei and necrotic debris in the gland
lumen.


D) Hyperplastic polyp:

goblet and absorptive cells with a serrated surface architecture.",1999-1264.PNG,B,2020-1280.PNG;2020-1279.PNG;2021-1281.PNG
Q11,which of the following is true?,"a)1, 2
b)1, 3
c)2, 3
d)All of the above","of the given statements, 2 and 3 are true. BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor gene and MYC is a proto-oncogene.
BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 17q21 and its function is to repair the double-stranded breaks in DNA. It is associated with familial breast and ovarian carcinoma.
BRCA1-associated breast cancers are commonly poorly differentiated.
All breast cancers are separated into 3 major groups based on the expression of two proteins, ER and HER2 (also known as ERBB2). HER2 cancers are defined as cancers overexpressing HER2    and can be either ER-positive or ER-negative. Thus HER2neu is expressed only in a fraction of     people with breast cancer.
EGF-receptor family has two proto-oncogenes: ERBB1 that codes for EGFR and ERBB2 that codes for HER. Mutation in EGFR results in adenocarcinoma of the lung, which is one of the main
subtypes of non-small cell lung carcinoma.
MYC is a proto-oncogene, that is expressed in all eukaryotic cells and belongs to the
immediate-early response genes, which are rapidly induced by RAS/MAPK signaling following growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells. Normally, MYC protein concentration are tightly  controlled at the level of transcription, translation and protein stability. The mechanisms by    which MYC promotes neoplastic cell growth may be follows:
• MYC activates the expression of many genes like D cyclins, that are involved in cell cycle progression
• MYC regulates the expression of telomerase
• MYC is one of the transcriptional factors that can act together to reprogram somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells
MYC gene is deregulated in a number of cancers such as Burkitt lymphoma, breast, colon, lung and other cancers. The functionally identical NMYC and LMYC genes are also amplified in



neuroblastomas and small cell cancers of the lung, respectively.",,C,
Q12,Identify the given condition.,"a)pemphigus vulgaris
b)Leprosy
c)Mycosis fungoides
d)visceral leishmaniasis","The given histologic picture shows a suprabasal blister suggesting the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris.
It is caused due to the production of antibodies mainly against desmoglein 3. Rarely antibodies against desmoglein 1 can also be found. The antibodies are commonly IgG antibodies.
Desmoglein 3 is mainly present in the basal and suprabasal layers of the skin and mucosa. The
patients, therefore, present with flaccid bullae over the skin and mucosal ulcerations. oral mucosa is commonly affected. other areas where ulceration can be seen are conjunctiva, nasopharynx,
larynx, etc. cutaneous lesions are more common over the scalp, face, neck, upper chest, and back.


Direct immunofluorescence will show the deposition of antibodies around the keratinocytes in the epidermis. It is treated with steroids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, etc.





other options:
B) Leprosy: Tuberculoid leprosy shows granulomatous lesions, without much bacilli. Hence called paucibacillary leprosy. Lepromatous lesions contain large aggregates of lipid-laden macrophages   (lepra cells), often filled with masses (globi) of acid-fast bacilli. Because of the presence of
abundant bacteria, it is also called as multibacillary.
Given below are the images that depict lepromatous lesion showing foamy macrophages with globi of pink/red acid-fast bacilli and tuberculoid leprosy showing granulomatous lesions,
respectively.






C) Mycosis fungoides: Mycosis fungoides is a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, characterized by
polymorphic patches and plaques with fine scaling usually present on the limbs, breast, and
buttocks. The lesions may be pruritic or even asymptomatic.  Histological hallmarks include: 1. Sézary-Lutzner cells - cells with cerebriform nuclei (infolded/ hyper-convoluted nuclear
membrane), 2. pautrier's microabscesses - tumor cells invade the epidermis as single cells and small clusters, forming a collection of atypical lymphocytes in the epidermis and 3.
Epidermotropism - pronounced invasion of the tumor cells into the epidermis.

Q14,A 2o-year-old athlete suddenly collapsed while playing football and was taken to the hospital where he was declared dead. His autopsy image is given below. which of the following is the most likely cause of death?,"a)valvular heart disease due to RHD
b)Sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmia
c)Sudden cardiac death due to Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
d)Sudden cardiac death due to atherosclerosis","The given image shows asymmetric septal hypertrophy and along with the scenario, it is
suggestive of sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmia. Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have an increased risk of sudden cardiac death from ventricular tachyarrhythmias. In fact,
arrhythmias are the most important/most common cause of death in hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is one of the most common causes of sudden, otherwise
unexplained death in young athletes. HCM is characterized by reduced stroke volume due to  impaired diastolic filling, which is a consequence of the massively hypertrophic left ventricle.
There is a dynamic obstruction to the left ventricular outflow as the anterior mitral leaflet moves towards the ventricular septum during systole. This compromised cardiac output in combination with a secondary increase in pulmonary venous pressure is the reason for exertional dyspnea at   times of increased oxygen demand.
Major clinical problems in HCM are atrial fibrillation, stroke, intractable cardiac
failure, ventricular arrhythmias and also sudden death. There is a harsh systolic ejection murmur caused by the ventricular outflow obstruction. Mutations causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(HCM) are most commonly seen in the genes encoding β-myosin heavy chain (MHC/MYH7) or myosin-binding protein C (MYBP-C).
HCM is mostly an autosomal dominant disorder. The most important histologic features of HCM myocardium are as follows:
• Massive myocyte hypertrophy particularly of transverse myocyte diameters
• Myofiber disarray including that of bundles of myocytes, individual myocytes, and contractile elements
• Interstitial and replacement fibrosis



Most of the patients can be treated with β blockers to decrease heart rate and contractility.
Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are used in patients with increased risk of ventricular   arrhythmias. some patients can also be treated by surgical excision of the septal muscle or by carefully controlled septal infarction through a catheter-based infusion of alcohol.

Q15,which of the following can be prevented by transfusing irradiated RBCs?,"a)Graft versus host disease
b)HLA Alloimmunization
c)Immunomodulation
d)Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)","Transfusion of irradiated RBCs prevent the incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) associated with the transfusion.
GVHD occurs when immunologically competent cells or their precursors are transplanted into   immunologically compromised recipients and the transferred cells recognize the alloantigens in the host and attack host tissues. It is seen most commonly during hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation but may occur following transplantation of solid organs too.
GVHD maybe of two types: acute and chronic.
Acute GVHD occurs within days to weeks after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It mainly involves the immune system and the epithelia of the skin (in the form of generalized
rash), liver( in the form of jaundice), and intestines (in the form of bloody diarrhea). But the affected tissues are not heavily infiltrated by lymphocytes.
Chronic GVHD may follow acute GVHD or may occur insidiously. These patients have extensive    skin damage, with destruction of skin appendages and fibrosis of the dermis, resembling systemic sclerosis. Cholestatic jaundice and esophageal strictures are also common. There will be
involution of the thymus and depletion of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes. There will also be
recurrent bouts of life-threatening infections. some may even develop autoimmunity, owing to the grafted CD4+ helper T cells reacting with host B cells and stimulating them, which may result in    autoantibodies production.
Depletion of donor T cells by irradiation, before transfusion can eliminate the occurrence of
GVHD. But irradiation also has its side effects such as recurrence of tumor in leukemic patients, increased incidence of graft failures and EBV-related B-cell lymphoma.",,A,
Q16,which of the following statements are correct regarding the effect of Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency?,"a)only 1 is correct.
b)1 &amp; 2 are correct.
c)2 &amp; 3 are correct.
d)1, 2 &amp; 4 are correct.","Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency causes decrease in reduced glutathione and decreased NADPH.
G6PD is an important enzyme involved in the hexose monophosphate shunt. Defective enzyme  function reduced the ability of red cells to protect themselves against oxidative injuries, thereby increasing lipid peroxidation and lead to hemolysis.
• G6PD reduces NADP to NADPH while oxidizing glucose-6-phosphate.
• This NADPH then provides reducing equivalents needed for conversion of oxidized glutathione to reduced glutathione.
• This reduced glutathione acts as a cofactor in reactions that neutralize compounds such as H202, thereby protecting against oxidant injury.
• Exposure of G6PD deficient red cells to oxidative stress leads to crosslinking of reactive
sulfhydryl groups on globin chains, which then becomes denatured and form membrane-bound precipitates called ‘Heinz bodies’, thereby producing membrane damage.
• when these inclusion bearing RBCs pass through the splenic cords, macrophages pluck out these Heinz bodies.
• The resultant cells are called ‘Bite cells’.
Clinical features:
• Episodic hemolysis, both intravascular and extravascular
• Hemolytic anaemia
• Hemoglobinemia
• Hemoglobinuria
The episode of hemolysis is self-limiting, since only the older RBCs are at risk for lysis, leaving the G6PD-replete younger RBCs in circulation. The recovery phase is heralded by reticulocytosis.",,B,

• Haemosiderinuria
• venous thrombosis (a leading cause of death in PNH)
• Patients diagnosed with PNH can later develop aplastic anemia and vice versa
PNH is an acquired disorder resulting from the mutation in the phosphatidylinositol glycan complementation group A gene (PIGA), an enzyme that is essential for the synthesis of



membrane-associated complement regulatory proteins. PNH blood cells are abnormally
susceptible to lysis or injury by complement since they are deficient in three GPI- linked proteins that regulate complement activity:
• Decay-accelerating factor or CD55
• Membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis or CD59 (Inhibitor of C3 convertase) and
• C8-binding protein
Diagnosis:
• Ham’s test: The abnormal sensitivity of red blood cells, leukocytes, and platelets to complement can be demonstrated in vitro using red cell lysis at acidic pH.
• Flow cytometry detects the red cells that are deficient in GPI-linked proteins such as CD59. Treatment:
Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody, that prevents the conversion of C5 to C5a has been proven effective in PNH. The definitive treatment is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",,B,

Q20,"A child presented with bilateral proptosis. From the peripheral smear, he was suspected to have chloroma. what is the next investigation of choice?","a)platelet count
b)wBC count
c)Flow cytometry
d)Bone marrow biopsy","The next investigation of choice, in a child suspected to have a chloroma, is a bone marrow biopsy.
chloroma, also called myeloid sarcoma, granulocytic sarcoma, or myeloblastoma is an
extramedullary tumor that occurs in 2% to 14% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  Frequent sites of involvement are the skin, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, bone, soft tissue, testis, and peritoneum.
Isolated orbital involvement of myeloid sarcoma is rare. proptosis is the most common
presentation. other symptoms include lacrimal swelling, conjunctival mass lesion, retinal
hemorrhages, ptosis, dystopia. Decreased visual acuity and ocular movement restriction have also been reported.
Most cases of chloroma can be diagnosed on peripheral smear examination, which is easily
available and is relatively inexpensive. sometimes it may not be associated with any peripheral smear abnormality, and hence bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be done to confirm
AML. The diagnosis can also be made if Auer rods are detected. Myeloid sarcomas have immunophenotypic features that are identical to AML.
Although myeloid sarcomas are radiosensitive, they are managed with systemic chemotherapy in most cases, even in the absence of bone marrow involvement. surgery and/or radiation therapy    may be indicated for symptomatic lesions or tumors causing local organ dysfunction or
obstruction.

Q21,A person working in an industry for a long time developed progressive breathlessness. The  histopathological image of his lung biopsy is given below. what industry was he most likely working in?,"a)silica
b)Asbestos
c)coal dust
d)cotton","From the clinical history of progressive breathlessness and the histopathological image showing
asbestos bodies, ferruginous bodies, and fibrosis, the patient is most likely working in the asbestos industry.
Asbestosis occurs due to the inhalation of crystalline hydrated silicates (asbestos). It is
characterized by diffuse parenchymal interstitial fibrosis. It usually begins in the lower lobes of
the lungs and may present with dyspnoea and cough, usually after 2o-3o years of exposure. other asbestos-related diseases include pleural plaques, recurrent pleural effusions, lung carcinoma, and mesothelioma.
Asbestos bodies are a hallmark finding. They appear as golden brown, fusiform, or beaded rods.  These are formed when the asbestos fibers are phagocytosed by the macrophages and are coated by iron-containing proteinaceous material derived from phagocyte ferritin. similar iron-protein   complexes coat other inorganic particulates other than asbestos which are termed as ferruginous bodies.
The image below shows asbestos bodies.


other options:
option A: silicosis is due to the inhalation of crystalline silicon dioxide (silica) as seen in
individuals employed in sandblasting or rock mining. Macrophages phagocytose inhaled silica particles, thereby activating and releasing inflammatory mediators (IL-1, IL-8) that cause
fibroblast recruitment. subsequently, collagen is deposited in the interstitium.
Microscopy reveals coalescent nodules of whorled collagen fibers surrounded by a peripheral zone of silica-laden macrophages.
shown below is an image of a silicotic nodule with collagen whorls as seen in this condition.





option C: Anthracosis/coal workers' pneumoconiosis is a pulmonary condition seen in coal
miners. The inhaled carbon pigment is engulfed by alveolar or interstitial macrophages, which
accumulate in the connective tissue. Initially it causes simple coal workers pneumoconiosis with  little or no pulmonary dysfunction. with continued exposure, lung tissue undergoes progressive   massive fibrosis which is called as complicated coal workers pneumoconiosis. The upper lobes of the lungs are commonly involved.
Microscopic features consist of coal-laden macrophages, black pigment, and dense collagenous interstitial fibrosis.
The image below shows anthracosis- black pigment engulfed within macrophages as well as in the form of deposits.

Q22,"A patient presented with complaints of dyspnea on exertion for 1 month. Echocardiography showed the presence of mitral stenosis and left ventricular hypertrophy. Identify the
histopathological finding given below and the probable diagnosis.","a)Aschoff body; Rheumatic heart disease
b)calcification of valve; Mitral stenosis
c)Granuloma; sarcoidosis
d)Non-caseating granuloma; Tuberculosis","The lesion shown in the histopathological slide is Aschoff's body and the most probable diagnosis is rheumatic heart disease (RHD).
Aschoff's bodies are the lesions found in the heart during acute rheumatic fever. They are
composed of foci ofT lymphocytes, activated macrophages called Anitschkow cells, and occasional plasma cells. Anitschkow cells have abundant cytoplasm and central round-to-ovoid nuclei with
chromatin that is centrally condensed into a slender, wavy ribbon. Hence, they are also called caterpillar cells.
Rheumatic fever is the leading cause of mitral stenosis. During acute rheumatic fever, Aschoff
bodies may be found in any of the three layers of the heart that results in pericarditis, myocarditis, or endocarditis.
chronic inflammation leads to diffuse thickening and fibrosis of the valve leaflets, often with
calcific deposits. Fibrinoid necrosis occurs due to inflammation of the endocardium and the
left-sided valves. over these areas of necrosis, small vegetations called verrucae develop along the lines of closure. Irregular thickenings present in the subendocardium are called Maccallum
plaques.
In chronic RHD, the mitral valve leaflet is thickened, with commissural fusion and shortening. There is thickening and fusion of the tendinous cords. This can lead to narrowing the mitral
orifice, leading to a fish mouth appearance (button hole).
some major manifestations of rheumatic Fever are:
• Migratory polyarthritis of the large joints
• pancarditis (myocarditis, pericarditis, or endocarditis)
• subcutaneous nodules (typically on extensor surfaces of extremities)
• Erythema marginatum, an irregular circinate skin rash
• sydenham chorea, a neurologic disorder with involuntary rapid movements

other options:
option B: Degenerative calcific deposits in the mitral valve typically develop in the fibrous
annulus. They are seen grossly as irregular, stony hard, occasionally ulcerated nodules at the base of the leaflets. usually, it does not affect valvular function. However, occasionally it can lead to
regurgitation, stenosis, or arrhythmias.
The image below shows severe calcification of the mitral valve annulus with focally thickened shortened and fused chordae.


option C: In sarcoidosis, the involved tissues contain well-formed non-necrotizing granulomas. They are composed of aggregates of tightly clustered epithelioid macrophages, often with giant  cells, usually without central necrosis. As the lesions become chronic, fibrous rims or hyaline     fibrous scars enclose the granulomas.
The image below shows non-necrotizing granulomas in the wall of a bronchiole in sarcoidosis.





option D: In tuberculosis, sites of active involvement of tuberculosis are marked histologically by a characteristic granulomatous inflammatory reaction composed of both caseating and
non-caseating tubercles. usually, granuloma shows central granular caseation surrounded by
multinucleate giant cells. central caseation may be absent in non-caseating granulomas. staining should be done to detect acid-fast bacilli when granulomas are present.
The image below shows a caseating granulomatous lesion with areas of caseation (on the right half) bordered by collections of epithelioid cells, Langhans giant cells, and lymphocytes.

Q23,"A patient with lytic lesions on the skull is suspected of a diagnosis of Langerhan cell
histiocytosis. which of the following is a characteristic finding on electron microscopy?","a)Histiocytes
b)Birbeck granules
c)Eosinophils
d)Giant cells","The presence of Birbeck granules in the cytoplasm is a characteristic finding of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) on electron microscopy.
Birbeck granules have a dilated terminal end producing a tennis racket–like appearance.
It contains the protein langerin (CD207). It is seen on electron microscopy.
The image below shows Birbeck granules on electron microscopy seen in LCH.


Histopathologically, Langerhans cells have a single large nucleus with a characteristic folded or
grooved nucleus (coffee-bean appearance) with small inconspicuous nucleoli. Birbeck granules are seen in the cytoplasm. The tumor cells specifically express HLA-DR, S-100, and CD1a and
langerin (CD207) markers.



The image below shows histopathological image of Langerhan cells with folded nuclei.


Langerhans cell histiocytosis occurs due to the proliferation of a special type of immature
dendritic cells, called Langerhans cells. Their normal function is to present antigens. The most common mutation is BRAFV6OOE gain-of-function mutation.
It is characterized by single or multiple osteolytic bone lesions and can also infiltrate nearly every organ, like the skin (of the scalp), lungs, liver, spleen, bone marrow, or the central nervous
system.
LCH can present as the following clinical entities:
• Multifocal multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis (Letterer-siwe disease)
• unifocal and multifocal unisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis (eosinophilic granuloma)- The combination of bone defects, diabetes insipidus, and exophthalmos is called the
Hand-schüller-Christian triad.
• pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis

Q24,A 6o-year-old patient presented with scrotal swelling and ataxia. which among the following could likely be a cause?,"a)Glioblastoma multiforme
b)Hodgkin lymphoma
c)Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
d)Non seminomatous germ cell tumor","The most likely cause in the following case is Non-Hodgkin lymphoma(NHL). Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a type of NHL is the most common lymphoma. NHL affects the elderly age   group and extranodal presentation is common. DLBCL can involve CNS, and CNS involvement is particularly common if there is involvement of the testes, paranasal sinuses, or bone marrow as    well.
primary testicular lymphoma is common in NHL when compared to Hodgkin lymphoma. primary testicular lymphoma(pTL) is an aggressive and uncommon form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma(NHL) usually affecting the elderly age group(&gt;6oy). It typically presents as a painless, firm testicular   mass. Constitutional symptoms are uncommon, and if present, warrant a systemic involvement.    Metastasis involves the central nervous system (CNS), skin, contralateral testis, and pleura
resulting in local complications.
Even though ataxia is seen as a paraneoplastic symptom due to cerebellar degeneration in
Hodgkin lymphoma, testicular involvement is very rare and so far only 5 cases have been
reported. Hodgkin lymphoma arises in a single node or chain of nodes and spreads first to
anatomically contiguous lymphoid tissues. The extranodal presentation is rare. The extranodal
disease can occur at any site like lung, liver, bone, and bone marrow is most common if it occurs. The central nervous system and the testis are exceptionally rare sites for Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Thus Hodgkin's lymphoma can be ruled out.
other options:
A) Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly malignant tumor, common in older adults in the fifth and sixth decades. The most common locations are the frontal and temporal lobes. The tumor may
spread and invade the other hemisphere, resulting in a characteristic
butterfly appearance. Extracranial metastases of malignant gliomas are extremely rare due to:
• Absence of a lymphatic system in the brain and spinal cord for systemic dissemination
• Dense dura around intracranial veins, preventing the penetration of the tumor



• Lack of nurturing stroma in other organs prevents the proliferation of glioblastoma cells
Therefore the tumor metastasizing to the testis is very much unlikely and glioblastoma can be ruled out.

option D) Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men aged from 15 to 35 years. Germ
cell tumors(GCT) account for 9o%–95% of cases.  Non-seminomatous form (NSGCT) metastasizes to the lungs, liver, central nervous system, and bone in order of frequency. The frequency of brain metastases is very low, not exceeding 1.2%.

Q25,A patient with cirrhosis and ascites presented to you. The gross appearance of his liver is as shown below. which among the following is true about it?,"a)Dark areas represent necrosis, white areas represent viable liver tissue
b)Dark areas represent viable liver tissue, white areas represent necrosis
c)white areas represent central hepatocytes
d)Dark areas represent peri-portal hepatocytes","The gross image of the liver shows a nutmeg appearance, seen in heart failure. The dark areas represent necrosis, white areas represent viable liver tissue.
Nutmeg liver refers to the mottled appearance of the liver which resembles the cut section of
nutmeg. This occurs as a result of hepatic venous congestion following right heart failure. The
dark centrilobular zones reflect sinusoidal congestion. Congestion is seen around the central veins usually from right-sided heart failure. The pale periportal zones reflect normal or fatty liver tissue.
The liver derives its blood supply from the portal venous system and the hepatic artery. The portal triad constitutes:
• Branches of the hepatic artery
• portal vein
• Bile duct



The blood from the portal vein and the hepatic artery flow through the intervening sinusoids and drains into the central vein. The central veins from adjacent lobules form interlobular veins,
which then unite as hepatic veins and finally drain into the inferior vena cava.
The hepatic lobule is divided into three zones:
• zone 1 is the periportal area
• zone 2 is the intermediate zone
• zone 3 is the area closest to the central vein
Right-sided cardiac failure leads to passive congestion of the liver. Left-sided cardiac failure leads to hypoperfusion and hypoxia of hepatocytes around central veins. The combination of
hypoperfusion and retrograde congestion causes centrilobular hemorrhagic necrosis, leading to this mottled appearance of the liver, known as nutmeg liver.

b)kaposi sarcoma, Giant cell, HIV
c)Hodgkin's lymphoma, RS cell, EBV
d)Infectious mononucleosis, RS cell, CMV","The probable diagnosis, cell, and virus from the given clinical scenario and the histopathological image are Hodgkin's lymphoma, Reed-Sternberg cells (RS cells), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)    respectively.
Hodgkin's lymphoma arises in a single lymph node or chain of nodes and spreads first to
anatomically contiguous lymphoid tissues. It usually presents as painless lymphadenopathy. The distinctive feature of Hodgkin's lymphoma is the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells.
RS cells are giant neoplastic cells derived from germinal centre or post–germinal centre B cells. They appear as large cells with multiple nuclei or a single nucleus with multiple nuclear lobes.   Each cell contains large inclusion-like prominent nucleoli, and abundant, usually slightly
eosinophilic, cytoplasm, depicting an owl-eye appearance, as shown in the image below.





WHO classifies Hodgkin's lymphoma into 5 subtypes:
• Nodular sclerosis: Frequent lacunar cells
• Mixed cellularity
• Lymphocyte-rich
• Lymphocyte depletion
• Nodular lymphocyte predominance
The first 4 subtypes are considered classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. The RS cells are CD 15+ and    CD3o+. The lymphocyte predominant type is considered non-classical Hodgkin's lymphoma with CD15-, CD3o-, CD2o+ and EB -.
The image below shows a popcorn cell seen in lymphocytic predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma.

other options:
option A: RS cells are diagnostic of Hodgkin's lymphoma, not non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The
histopathologic findings in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) are varied and depend on the subtype. option B: kaposi sarcoma is a vascular neoplasm caused by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), also     known as kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus. cutaneous lesions of kaposi sarcoma are composed of
spindle cells, mostly in the dermis or subcutaneous tissues, with small vessels and slit-like spaces with red cells.

option D: Infectious mononucleosis is caused by EBV. The peripheral blood smear shows absolute lymphocytosis with mononucleosis cells which are atypical activated T lymphocytes. They have
abundant cytoplasm with multiple vacuolations and azurophilic granules, and an oval, indented, or folded nucleus and are shown below.





About 5-7% of the cases of infectious mononucleosis can be caused by the cytomegalovirus (CMV), which can also cause pneumonia.

Q27,"A person was brought to the emergency department with facial swelling, itching, and
hypotension following a bee sting. The mentioned clinical features are due to the increase in which immunoglobulin?","a)IgA
b)IgE
c)IgM
d)IgG","The given clinical features suggest type 1 hypersensitivity reaction and are mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE).
Immediate (Type I) hypersensitivity reactions refer to allergic reactions or allergies.
It is a rapid immunologic reaction that is triggered by the binding of an antigen to IgE antibody on the surface of mast cells. It occurs in a previously sensitized individual. These reactions are



induced by environmental antigens (allergens) that stimulate strong TH2 responses and IgE production in genetically susceptible individuals.
Activation of TH2 cells is mediated by IL-4 and in turn, TH2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and
IL-13. These cytokines act on B cells to stimulate IgE and activation of eosinophils. IgE coats mast cells by binding to the FcεRI receptor. Re-exposure to the allergen leads to cross-linking of the IgE and FcεRI which in turn causes activation of mast cells releasing powerful mediators. The
principal mediators are:
• Histamine
• proteases
• prostaglandins
• Leukotrienes
• Cytokines like TNF, IL-1, and chemokines.
The clinical manifestations may be local or systemic and range from mildly annoying rhinitis to fatal anaphylaxis.
It occurs in two phases:
• The immediate phase is characterized by vasodilation, vascular leakage, smooth muscle spasm (in asthma), or glandular secretions. These changes occur within minutes after exposure to an     allergen and subside in a few hours.
• Late-phase reaction is characterized by infiltration of tissues with eosinophils, neutrophils,
basophils, monocytes, and CD4+ T cells. Late-phase reaction sets in 2 to 24 hours later and may last for several days.

Q28,All of the following are associated with massive splenomegaly except :,"a)Chronic myeloid leukemia
b)Aplastic anemia
c)Hairy cell leukemia
d)Lymphoma","All the above are associated with massive splenomegaly except aplastic anemia.
Aplastic anemia is a syndrome of chronic primary hematopoietic failure. This results in pancytopenia (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia). Important causes include
• Alkylating agents, antimetabolites
• Benzene
• whole-body irradiation
• viral infections: Hepatitis (unknown virus), Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Herpes zoster
• Fanconi anemia
The patient will have
• Decreased red blood cells leading to anemia
• Decreased white blood cells leading to recurrent infections
• Decreased platelets leading to petechiae and ecchymoses.
Many other leukemias and lymphomas may have a similar presentation. However, splenomegaly is characteristically absent in these patients.
The bone marrow is markedly hypocellular. It is largely devoid of hematopoietic cells. Marrow aspirates yield a dry tap having only fat cells, fibrous stroma, lymphocytes, and plasma cells.
Aplasia is best appreciated in marrow biopsies. The following image shows a hypocellular bone marrow with little hematopoiesis and several fat cells.


stem cell transplantation is the treatment of choice in those with a suitable donor.
Immunosuppressive therapy is responsive in old patients or in patients without suitable donors. other options:
option A- Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm with the presence of BCR-ABL fusion gene translocation mutation. The marrow is markedly hypercellular because of    increased numbers of maturing granulocytic precursor cells. This results in decreased
hematopoiesis within the bone marrow. The spleen is often greatly enlarged as a result of



extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis. Extramedullary hematopoiesis can also produce mild hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy.
option C- Hairy cell leukemia is a memory B-cell neoplasm predominantly seen in middle-aged
male patients. It occurs due to activating BRAF mutations. Infiltration of the bone marrow, liver,   and spleen with tumor cells result in splenomegaly. sometimes, this can be the only finding in the patient. pancytopenia results from marrow involvement.
Hairy cells have round, oblong, or reniform nuclei and moderate amounts of pale blue cytoplasm  with thread-like or bleb-like extensions. Immunophenotyping shows hairy cell leukemias typically express the pan-B-cell markers CD19 and CD20 and certain relatively distinctive markers, such as CD11c, CD25, CD103, and annexin A1.
option D- Lymphomas cause splenomegaly due to the infiltration of neoplastic cells in the spleen.",,B,2051-1320.PNG
Q29,"A 42-year-old female patient presents with cough, low-grade fever, and hemoptysis.
Investigations reveal a cavitary lesion on her right lung apex, which on biopsy reveals caseous necrosis. The underlying pathophysiology is :","a)Enzyme degradation
b)Type 4 hypersensitivity reaction
c)Fibrinoid deposition
d)sudden cut-off of blood supply","The clinical scenario with complaints of cough, low-grade fever, hemoptysis is suggestive of
pulmonary tuberculosis. The diagnosis is further supported by a cavitary lesion in the apex of the lung and a biopsy showing caseous necrosis. The pathophysiology is a type 4 hypersensitivity
reaction mediated by activated macrophages.
Tuberculosis is a chronic pulmonary and systemic disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Granulomatous inflammation and tissue damage are by Th-1 mediated macrophage activation and killing of bacteria. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) released by Th-1 cells is the critical mediator that
activates the macrophages. This activation differentiates the macrophages into epithelioid cells that aggregate to form granuloma. This is a T-cell mediated (Type 4) hypersensitivity reaction.  pulmonary TB due to exogenous (new infection) or endogenous (reactivation of a dormant
primary lesion) infection in a sensitized individual is called post-primary or reactivation or secondary or adult-type TB.
The apical and posterior segments of the upper lobe and superior segments of the lower lobe are  most commonly involved in post-primary TB due to increased ventilation in these segments than the lower zones. patients often present with fever, productive cough, blood-streaked sputum,
night sweats, malaise, loss of appetite, and weight loss.
Radiological findings include ill-defined opacification in the upper lobes, consolidation, collapse, and cavitation development.
• Typically, the disease is parenchymal without nodal enlargement.
• Cavitation is a distinguishing feature of postprimary TB.
• Typical cavities are thick-walled and irregular.
• Air-fluid levels are uncommon in TB. The presence of air-fluid levels indicates superadded infections.
• upper-lobe involvement with cavitation and the absence of lymphadenopathy distinguishes postprimary TB from primary TB.
The image below shows chest X-ray findings of a post-primary TB with a cavity (black arrows) in the right upper lobe and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (white triangles) in the apical regions.

option C: Fibrinoid deposition is seen in fibrinoid necrosis. It is seen in immune reactions
involving blood vessels with deposition of fibrinoid material which is combination of immune complexes and plasma proteins. Eg: vasculitis syndromes

Q30,A 45-year-old male patient was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. which of the following is true about intracellular regulation of iron in the above condition?,"a)Ferritin translation is increased by binding IRP to IRE
b)Ferritin translation is decreased by binding IRP to IRE
c)Transferrin receptor 1 translation is unaffected by binding IRP to IRE
d)Transferrin receptor 1 translation is decreased by binding IRP to IRE","In iron deficiency anemia, ferritin translation is decreased by binding iron regulatory protein to iron response elements.
Dietary iron is carried in the blood by transferrin and enters cells via endocytosis, mediated by the transferrin receptor. Excess iron is stored by binding to ferritin. The levels of transferrin,
transferrin receptor (TfR), and ferritin are therefore crucial to cellular iron homeostasis.
The synthesis of these three proteins is regulated in response to iron availability and aconitase (enzyme in citric acid cycle).
when a cell is depleted of iron, the aconitase enzyme is converted to apoaconitase. Apoaconitase is identical to iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP-1) and is closely related to IRP-2. It regulates iron     metabolism.
The iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) are two cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins that control iron metabolism. They bind to regions in the mRNA containing the ferritin and transferrin receptor. These mRNA sequences are part of hairpin structures known as iron response elements (IREs).



• when the IRPs bind to the 5' untranslated IRE sequence in the ferritin mRNA, IRPs block ferritin translation, thus decreasing ferritin.
• when IRPs are bound to the 3' end of the untranslated IRE sequence, they stabilize the mRNA, prevent its degradation and increase the copies of transferrin receptor per mRNA molecule.
Hence, in iron-deficient cells, iron storage (bound to ferritin) is reduced and iron uptake (via transferrin receptor) becomes more efficient.",,B,
Q31,"A 65-year-old male patient with chronic fatigue and lymphadenopathy presents to the
outpatient department. His peripheral smear shows the presence of smudge cells. which of the following additional investigations will you do to arrive at a diagnosis?","a)Polymerase chain reaction
b)Fluorescent in situ hybridization
c)Flow cytometry
d)cytogenetics","An elderly patient with chronic fatigue and lymphadenopathy, and a peripheral smear showing the presence of smudge cells suggest a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Immunophenotyping using flow cytometry is the investigation done to arrive at the diagnosis. The classical immunophenotypic feature of CLL is CD 19+, CD2o+, CD 23+, CD5+.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is a peripheral B-cell neoplasm usually affecting adults, more commonly men. Patients are often asymptomatic at diagnosis. when symptomatic, it
presents non specifically with easy fatigability, weight loss, and anorexia. Generalized
lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are present in most symptomatic patients.
The chromosomal defects in CLL include:
• Deletion of 13q (commonest and has a good prognosis)
• Deletion of 11q
• Trisomy 12q
• Deletion of 17p (poor prognosis)
The peripheral blood smear in cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) contains small round lymphocytes having condensed chromatin and scant cytoplasm. some of these cells may get
disrupted while preparing the smears, producing smudge cells. An absolute lymphocyte count of    &gt;5ooo/mm3 is required for diagnosis. Hypogammaglobulinemia is commonly seen, making the patient susceptible to infections. A few patients may develop hemolytic anemia or
thrombocytopenia due to autoantibodies made by non-neoplastic B cells.
on lymph node biopsy: Lymph nodes are composed of small lymphocytes admixed with larger     activated lymphocytes. The large lymphocytes contain mitotically active cells and gather in loose aggregates referred to as proliferation centers. These proliferation centers are pathognomic to
CLL when present.
Expectant management is the treatment of choice for asymptomatic patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The gold standard for therapy is a combination
of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab.
Richter’s syndrome is a complication of CLL in which there is a transformation to an aggressive lymphoma, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

Q32,oil red o stain is used in which of the following?,"a)Formalin fixation
b)Frozen section
c)Alcohol fixation
d)Gluteraldehyde fixation","oil red o (oRo) stain is used in frozen section.
oil red o stains lipid/ fats and gives a characteristic orange/red appearance. It is used in the    unfixed frozen sections as the fixation of fats with other routine processes may lose the lipid   content. 1o% Neutral buffer formaldehyde (NBF) is the preferred fixative in histopathological sections staining with oil red o. zenker's fixative and Helly's fixative are best avoided during  staining with oRo.
oil red o stains the lipid in the vacuoles in the pulmonary vasculature. It can be useful in
identifying fat emboli in lung tissue, diagnosing renal cell carcinoma, and sebaceous gland tumors of the skin.
other stains used for lipids or fats:
• Nile blue sulfate. The preferred fixative is formal calcium.
• osmic acid is used in the frozen section. 1o% NBF is the preferred fixative
• sudan black B is used in the frozen section. The preferred fixative is 1o% NBF.
other options:
option A: Formalin fixation- Formalin as 1o% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) is the most common fixative used in diagnostic pathology.
option C: Ethyl alcohol- Ideal fixative for cytological smears because they act quickly and give good nuclear detail.
option D: Glutaraldehyde- preferred fixative in electron microscopy. The standard solution is a 2.5% buffered glutaraldehyde.

Q33,"A boy presents with fever, night sweats, and neck swelling. The biopsy of swelling showed a starry sky appearance. what is the most likely genetic abnormality seen in this case?","a)MYC
b)RAS
c)BCR-ABL
d)p53","The given clinical scenario and the classical histopathological finding of starry sky appearance suggest the diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma and the most likely genetic abnormality is the
translocation of the MYC gene on chromosome 8.
Burkitt's lymphoma arises from mature germinal center B-cells that express surface IgM, CD19, CD2O, CD1O, and BCL6.
It is divided into endemic and sporadic types, both of which occur mainly in children or young adults.



• African (endemic) Burkitt lymphoma often presents as a mass involving the mandible and may involve the abdominal viscera, particularly the kidneys, ovaries, and adrenal glands.
• sporadic (non-endemic) Burkitt lymphoma most often appears as a mass involving the ileocecum and peritoneum.
• A subset of aggressive lymphomas occurs in individuals infected with HIV.
All forms of Burkitt lymphoma are associated with translocations ofthe MYC gene on
chromosome 8 that lead to increased MYC protein levels. Essentially all endemic Burkitt lymphomas are latently infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).
The tumor shows a high mitotic index with numerous apoptotic cells. The nuclear remnants of
these apoptotic cells are phagocytosed by interspersed benign macrophages. The phagocytes have abundant clear cytoplasm, creating a characteristic starry sky pattern.
Burkitt lymphoma is very aggressive but responds well to intensive chemotherapy.

Q34,An electron microscopic picture of a cut section of a nerve fiber is given. Identify the area which will be affected in the most common variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome.,"a)1
b)2
c)3
d)4","The most common variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome is acute inflammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy (AIDP). The area affected in this condition is the myelin sheath (marked as 2 in the image).





Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute autoimmune disease that causes fulminant polyradiculoneuropathy. It is a T-cell mediated immune response.
GBS is usually associated with a history of upper respiratory infection (URI) or acute
gastroenteritis (AGE) 1-3 weeks prior. The causative organisms may be campylobacter jejuni, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
It presents with the following features:
• Ascending motor paralysis (lower limbs &gt; upper limbs)
• Sensory deficits may or may not be seen
• Deep tendon reflexes - absent
• Transient bladder dysfunction - severe cases
• Autonomic manifestations - loss of vasomotor control, postural hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias
Histological examination shows inflammation of peripheral nerves, manifested as perivenular and endoneurial infiltration by lymphocytes, macrophages, and a few plasma cells. on electron
microscopy, an early effect on myelin sheaths is seen. There is segmental demyelination induced by the actions of activated macrophages.
There are several types of Guillain–Barre syndrome:
• Demyelinating
• Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) - most common
• Axonal
• Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN)
• Acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN)
• Regional GBS syndromes: Miller–Fisher syndrome (MFS)",2009-1273.PNG,B,2059-1328.PNG
