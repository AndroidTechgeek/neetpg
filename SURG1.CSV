Q1,"A man met with a road traffic accident, which resulted in paralysis of both his upper and
lower limbs. He has not passed urine and tenderness is elicited in the cervical region. what will you advise regarding radiography?","a)The patient should not be shifted and portable x-ray machine should be used after neck stabilization.
b)Instruct the radiographer to take cervical and chest x-ray.
c)Instruct the radiographer to take cervical x-ray AP and lateral view without any cervical support.
d)order a cervical x-ray and shift the patient from the trolley by himself.","The given clinical situation suggests a cervical spine injury due to trauma. The patient should not
be shifted and a portable X-ray machine should be used for radiography after neck stabilization. Management in a trauma patient with a suspected cervical fracture involves the following steps:
• spinal immobilization with a rigid cervical collar and a long spine board is the immediate step in the management of blunt/penetrating cervical trauma cases.
• It is followed by a gross assessment of spinal cord function by eliciting extremity movement.
Tenderness over the injured vertebrae or the presence of a deformity is indicative of an associated fracture.
• Imaging is done by X-ray or CT. portable X-ray machines are preferred to avoid further injury while mobilizing the patient. They are useful in visualizing thoracic and lumbar vertebrae but     not the cervicothoracic junction. Cervical CT has been made the modality of choice in most
emergency departments owing to the high quality of images that can be obtained.",,A,
Q2,"A 42-year-old woman presented with a history of painless breast lump measuring 6.2 X 4.5 cm in the left upper outer quadrant and no axillary nodes. Core cut biopsy showed ductal
carcinoma in situ. She underwent tumor resection with adequate margins and postoperative HPE showed DCIS with intermediate-grade necrosis and with 6-mm clearance on margins.   what is the next step of treatment?","a)No additional treatment
b)Adjuvant radiotherapy
c)Adjuvant chemotherapy
d)Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy","According to silverstein van Nuys prognostic index for DCIs, the total score is 9. Hence, the patient would require adjuvant radiotherapy.
Age: 42 years (score 2), size: 62mm (score 3), clearance margin: 6mm (score 2) with intermediate-grade necrotic features (score 2).
silverstein van Nuys prognostic index for DCIs:
Treatment:
• scores 4-6 with &gt;3mm margin: Excision alone



• Score 7 with &lt; 3 mm margin, score 8 with &gt; 3mm margin, score 9 with &gt;5mm margin: Excision with RT
• Score 9 with &lt; 5mm margin &amp; score 1o-12: Mastectomy
If the patient is ER/PR+, adjuvant hormonal therapy with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor is indicated. Current data does not support the use of HER-2-directed therapy in DCIS.
Indications for adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer:
• Locally advanced breast cancers (T3, T4, N1, N2, N3)
• Following breast conservation surgery
• After mastectomy if tumor size ≥5 cm, skin or chest wall involvement, lymphovascular invasion and axillary node-positive for metastasis.
Post-treatment surveillance after treatment for DCIS includes history, physical examination, and routine mammography (if applicable).

Q3,which of the following is false regarding imaging in the primary survey of a trauma patient?,"a)Hemodynamically unstable patient should not be sent for CT scan
b)All patients should have chest X-ray PA view only
c)X-ray of the pelvis is essential in primary survery
d)X-rays in primary survey must also be done in pregnant women",Chest X-ray and X-ray pelvis are taken in AP view in the adjuncts to the primary survey of a trauma patient.,,B,
Q4,A patient presents with renal calculus of &gt; 4 cm of the staghorn type. what is the best management?,"a)Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy
b)percutaneous nephrolithotomy
c)ureteroscopic removal
d)Retrorenal surgery","The best management for staghorn renal calculus of &gt;4 cm is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL).
The initial management of renal stones depends on the stone size and includes conservative
management, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL), and PCNL. PCNL is preferred for     stones &gt; 2cm in size and for staghorn calculi, while ESWL is used to treat renal stones of size o.6 to 1.5 cm. PCNL is indicated in
• Renal stones &gt;2 cm
• Staghorn calculus
• Failed shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) or retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for renal calculi
• Lower pole renal stones with anatomy that is unfavorable for ESWL



other options:
option C: ureteroscopic removal is attempted for failed SWLs or pCNLs, and is not the first choice in the surgical management of renal stones.
option D: RIRS is a minimally invasive procedure similar to ureteroscopic removal, where the     kidney is accessed using a slim and flexible ureteroscope in a retrograde manner via the ureteric orifice. It is indicated for lower pole renal stones &lt; 2 cm.",,B,
Q5,All of the following can be done to transport a polytrauma patient who is conscious except?,"a)strap their thorax, abdomen and lower limbs on a stretcher
b)place in prone position to prevent aspiration
c)put patient on lateral position and shift him immediately
d)Roll the patient onto a hard board","patients with polytrauma are shifted into a supine or prone position (not in a lateral position) by laying them over a firm surface to restrict spinal movement.
As per ATLS guidelines, in patients with trauma, airway management is first done along with
cervical spine stabilization. All trauma patients until proven otherwise are considered to have an injured vertebral column.
The patients are placed supine on a firm surface without rotating or bending the spinal column    and a rigid cervical collar (philadelphia collar) is applied. Aspiration can be prevented by putting the patient in the prone position and strapping can be done to provide further stabilization.


Long spine boards with straps are helpful in the rapid transport of the patient from one place to  another. The patient can be put on the long spine board by log-rolling (a technique where four     people hold the patient and roll the patient like a log without allowing rotation or bending of the spine).
Conscious and alert patient indirectly means that they don’t need intubation and their airway is patent. If the patient is unconscious always check the airway and if needed, endotracheal
intubation must be done immediately by various methods. preferably by direct laryngoscopy and
intubation.",,C,4652-2903.PNG
Q6,Identify the condition.,"a)cholesterolosis
b)strawberry gallbladder
c)Gallbladder polyps
d)Gallbladder carcinoma","The given image shows a resected specimen of a gallbladder with a polyp on the inner surface.
specimen of gallbladder carcinoma would include an en-bloc dissection of the gall bladder,
surrounding liver tissue and regional lymph nodes (option D). In specimens of cholesterolosis,
also known as strawberry gallbladder, the gall bladder would appear yellow and coarsely granular due to the presence lipid nodules (options A and B).
Gall bladder polyps are usually incidental findings during abdominal imaging. Most of them are benign and comprise cholesterol polyps, adenomyomas or inflammatory polyps. Adenomatous
polyps are the most common neoplastic polyps. The majority of patients with polyps are stable
and smaller polyps are kept under observation. cholecystectomy is done for symptomatic patients (biliary colic, pancreatitis), patients &gt;5o years, sessile polyps with thickening &gt;4 mm and
polyps &gt;1o mm.
The risk factors for malignancy in an adenomatous polyp include age &gt;5o years, size &gt;1o mm, sessile polyp, documented increase in size, and coexistence with gallstones.
other options:
option D: The gallbladder in a patient with carcinoma is removed via an en-bloc dissection with surrounding liver tissue along with regional lymph nodes. The given image below shows a cut
surface of the resected gallbladder with a tumor at the neck along with liver bed involvement (marked by the red arrow).


options A and B: cholesterolosis (strawberry gallbladder) is characterized by the accumulation of lipids (triglycerides, cholesterol precursors and cholesterol esters) in the lamina propria of the
gallbladder wall. The nodules are less than 1 mm in diameter and there is mucous villous
hyperplasia, which gives it a coarse, yellow and granular appearance, giving it a strawberry-like appearance. The given images below show cholesterolosis.",4644-2899-1.png,C,4653-2904.PNG;4654-2905.PNG
Q7,colour of 22G IV cannula is?,"a)pink
b)Green
c)Blue
d)yellow",The 22G IV cannula is blue in colour.,,C,
Q8,Fr in size of Foley's catheter refers to:,"a)outer Diameter
b)Inner Diameter
c)Inner circumference
d)Radius","The French (Fr) measurement unit refers to the outer diameter.
As per the French system, the outer circumference equals 3 times the outer diameter. one French unit (1 Fr) equals 1 mm of the outer circumference and o.3 mm of the outer diameter. Therefore,   the outer diameter in mm can be determined by dividing the Fr size by 3.
Example: An 18 Fr would have a circumference of 18 mm and an outer diameter of 6 mm.",,A,
Q9,"A school bus full of children met with an accident. As the doctor in charge of triage, which of the following will you attend to first?","a)Airway obstruction
b)Grade 4 shock
c)Flail chest
d)severe head injury","The patient with airway obstruction, categorized as red, should be attended to first.
Triage is used to classify the priority of treatment. It is carried out at the site of the disaster to
determine the priority for immediate medical attention, transportation, and admission to the
hospital. Triage decisions are made by deciding which injuries constitute the greatest immediate threat to life. In general, airway problems are more rapidly lethal than breathing problems &gt;   circulation problems &gt; neurologic injuries.
The internationally accepted four-color coded system is commonly used. It includes:
• Red - High-priority attention or transfer
• yellow - Medium priority



• Green - Ambulatory patients
• Black - Dead or moribund patients",,A,
Q10,which parameter is the best guide to monitor the adequacy of fluid resuscitation in a patient?,"a)central venous pressure
b)urine output
c)Blood pressure
d)oxygen saturation","urine output is the best measure of organ perfusion and the best monitor for adequacy of fluid resuscitation.
Adequate end-organ perfusion is best indicated by urine output of  &gt;o.5 to 1 mL/kg/h. However, it does not give a minute-to-minute value.
The level of consciousness is an important marker for cerebral perfusion.
The only clinical indicators of perfusion of the gastrointestinal tract and muscular beds are measures of lactic acidosis (lactate and base deficit) and mixed venous oxygen saturation.
other options:
option A: Central venous pressure (Cvp) is the mean pressure in the superior vena cava, used for  estimation of preload and right atrial pressure. Normal Cvp ranges from 2 to 7 mm Hg (3 to 9 cm H2o). A sick or injured patient with a Cvp &lt;3 mm Hg is presumed to be volume depleted and    may be given fluids with relative safety. However, Cvp is unreliable in assessing volume status or  left ventricular function with respect to resusitation.
options C and D: Blood pressure and oxygen saturation do not reflect body fluid levels.",,B,
Q11,which of the following is the most common presentation of abdominal desmoid tumor?,"a)Abdominal pain
b)Abdominal mass
c)Fever
d)Rectal prolapse","Explanation:
The most common presentation of an abdominal desmoid tumor is an abdominal mass.
Desmoid tumors, also known as fibromatosis, aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid-type
fibromatosis are locally aggressive tumors that lack metastatic potential. Desmoid tumors can be sporadic in origin or associated with familial adenomatous polyposis.
These tumors arise from fibro-aponeurotic tissue and typically are manifested as a slowly growing mass. They present as firm, non-painful, non-tender masses in the abdominal wall, shoulder, hip   and limbs, mesentery, and pelvis. They are also associated with trauma, pregnancy, and oral
contraceptive usage.
The investigation of choice for a desmoid tumor is MRI. It is superior to CT in defining the
pattern and the extent of involvement and can determine recurrence after surgery. Diagnosis is    established by a biopsy with immunohistochemistry, which stains positive for beta-catenin, actin and vimentin, and negative for desmin, cytokeratin and S-1oo.
Treatment:
• An initial observation is preferred for stable, asymptomatic, primary or recurrent desmoids, especially if surgery can cause high mortality.



• Surgical resection with negative margin clearance is reserved for patients with small abdominal wall tumors associated with pain or an increase in size.
• Tamoxifen and NSAIDs are used as first-line medical therapy. other systemic treatment options are low-dose chemotherapy, tyrosinase kinase inhibitors, and full-dose chemotherapy
• Radiotherapy is preferred for candidates unfit for surgery, patients refusing surgery and when surgical resection is associated with high morbidity.",,B,
Q12,"A 1o-year-old child came with complaints of pain over the right lower quadrant and lower back pain. on examination, the patient had pain over the right side of the hip on passive   extension with a mass in the right lumbar region pointing towards the groin. what is the   most probable diagnosis?","a)pyelonephritis
b)psoas abscess
c)Appendicitis
d)Torsion of right undescended testis","The given clinical history of lower back pain, mass in the right lumbar region pointing towards the groin and pain on passive extension of the ipsilateral hip is suggestive of a psoas abscess.
psoas abscess is a retroperitoneal abscess, caused due to various etiologies. previously,
tuberculosis of the spine was the most common cause secondary to spreading infection from the digestive or urinary tract, which can cause psoas abscess. Nowadays, Crohn’s disease is the most common cause. patients present with flank pain, fever and chills, malaise and weight loss. They
can have referred pain to the hip, groin or knee. when the swelling extends across the groin and    below the inguinal ligament along the course of the iliopsoas, it becomes cross fluctuant across the inguinal ligament.
Imaging is done by a CT scan, which shows a low-density mass with surrounding inflammation and infiltration of surrounding fat and gas or air-fluid levels.






Treatment is done by percutaneous CT-guided drainage and appropriate antibiotics.
other options:
option A: pyelonephritis is usually associated with a history of urinary tract infection and sudden onset of pain in the flank and hypochondrium, not the lumbar region.
option C: Appendicitis (retrocaecal) can present with pain on passive extension of the hip (psoas sign), but the presence of a mass in the right lumbar region pointing towards the groin makes it  an unlikely diagnosis.
option D: Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency condition presenting with sudden onset pain in the scrotum, groin and lower abdomen, tenderness, redness and edema of the scrotal skin.",,B,4656-2906.PNG;4657-2907.PNG
Q13,which layer is involved in blister formation in a superficial partial thickness burn?,"a)Epidermis
b)subcutaneous tissue
c)papillary dermis
d)Reticular dermis","The papillary dermis is involved in blister formation in a superficial partial-thickness burn.
First-degree burns involve only the epidermis, with pain, redness, and mild swelling.
second-degree (partial thickness) burns involve the epidermis and some parts of the dermis (also known as partial-thickness burns). Further divided into:
• superficial second-degree burns - involves the upper part of the dermis (papillary) and shows pain, blisters, and severe swelling.
• Deep second-degree burns - extends up to the reticular layer of the dermis and appears more pale and mottled, does not blanch to touch, but remains painful to pinprick.
Third-degree or full-thickness burns involve the full thickness of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue.
Fourth-degree burns involve deep structures such as muscle and bone.",,C,
Q14,proper functioning of ICD tube is indicated by _____.,"a)Continuous air bubbles coming out of the underwater drain
b)oscillation of water column in the tube
c)chest X-ray
d)Auscultation","oscillation of the water column level (moving up and down during respiration) within the tube in the water seal chamber is indicative of a functioning (patent) ICD tube.
During spontaneous respiration, the water level rises with inspiration and falls with expiration.   Whereas during positive pressure ventilation, the opposite occurs. This oscillation is also known as tidaling.
other options:
option A: Continous bubbling indicates an air leak in the drainage system, which should be corrected
option B: Chest X-ray is useful for assessing the position of the ICD tube inside the chest, not its functioning.
option C: Auscultation is not useful for assessing the functioning of an ICD tube.",,B,
Q15,"In a preoperative surgical safety checklist, which of the following is not present?","a)signature of the doctor
b)consent
c)Functioning pulse oximeter
d)sterility of instruments","In a preoperative patient surgical safety checklist, doctor’s signature is not required.

Q16,"A trauma patient suffers a renal laceration with urine extravasation. He is managed   conservatively. However, after a few days, he presents with a urinoma. The next best management for this patient would be?","a)ureteral stenting
b)surgical repair and exploration
c)observation
d)percutaneous drainage","The patient with a history of grade IV renal injury (renal laceration with urine extravasation) who develops a persistent urinoma (a mass formed by encapsulated extravasated urine) should be
managed with the placement of an internal ureteral stent.



In patients not cured by ureteral stenting, percutaneous nephrostomy or transcutaneous drain may be required.
Management of renal injuries
Blunt trauma is the main cause of renal injuries and is self-limiting. Blunt trauma is mostly treated conservatively. Most penetrating injuries require surgical renal exploration.
• Grading of injury through CECT
• If hemodynamically stable
• Conservative management - Bedrest &amp; hemodynamic monitoring
• In grade IV, a repeat CT scan to ensure the extravasation of urine has resolved.
• If hemodynamically unstable
• surgical exploration and repair
• In grade V, nephrectomy.",,A,
Q17,which of the following is considered balanced resuscitation?,"a)Maintaining airway, breathing and circulation
b)Allow permissible hypotension
c)Maintain ph by ensuring acid-base balance
d)Fluid resuscitation by giving colloids and crystalloids","Permissive hypotension is a part of balanced resuscitation in trauma management to avoid bleeding.
Damage control resuscitation (DCR) i.e. balanced resuscitation is used in the settings of major
trauma. It aims to control hemorrhage and prevent coagulopathy prior to the development of the trauma triad of death (hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy). The components of DCR
include:
• Permissive hypotension until definitive surgical control
• Minimize crystalloid based resuscitation
• Early use of blood products (PRBCs, FFP, platelets, cryoprecipitate) in the ratio of 1:1:1
• use of hemostatic agents such as tranexamic acid, recombinant factor 7a, prothrombin complex concentrates
DCR has the following advantages:
• Minimizes the impact of trauma-induced coagulopathy
• Limits blood product waste
• Reduces the complications that occur with aggressive crystalloid resuscitation.",,B,
Q18,The flap shown in the picture is which of the following?,"a)serratus anterior flap
b)pectoral myocutaneous flap
c)TRAM flap
d)VRAM flap","The given image shows a serratus anterior flap. The serratus anterior flap is a highly reliable flap with a consistently long pedicle. Its anatomy permits coverage of complex wounds. The

Q19,A 25-year-old patient presented with neck swelling which moves with deglutition as shown below. what is your diagnosis?,"a)Branchial cyst
b)cystic hygroma
c)Thyroglossal cyst
d)cervical lymphadenopathy","A thyroglossal cyst is the only midline neck swelling that moves with deglutition. This is because the thyroid gland is fixed to the hyoid.
Thyroglossal duct cyst:
It is a congenital midline neck swelling that typically presents during childhood often noticed after an upper respiratory infection. It represents the persistence of the track of the thyroid gland and    can be found adjacent to the midline. The thyroid gland descends early in fetal life from the base    of the tongue towards its position in the lower neck. At the time of descent, the hyoid bone has not been formed and the track of the thyroid gland is variable, passing in front, through, or behind the eventual position of the hyoid body.


clinical features of thyroglossal cyst:
• classically the cyst moves upwards on swallowing and on tongue protrusion. This indicates attachment to the hyoid bone.
• swelling is smooth, soft, fluctuant (cystic), nontender, mobile, often transilluminant.
• Thyroid fossa is empty, if there is no thyroid in the normal location.



complications of thyroglossal cyst:
• The most common complication is infection.
• Thyroglossal fistula is an acquired condition that either follows infection of the cyst which bursts open or due to inadequate removal of the cyst.
• 1% of thyroglossal duct cysts are found to be malignant of which the most common type of cancer is papillary (85%).
Neck swellings that move with deglutition are:
• Thyroid swellings
• subhyoid bursitis
• Dermoid cysts attached to the hyoid bone
However, only the thyroglossal cyst moves with tongue protrusion. This is because the duct extends from the foramen caecum of the tongue to the isthmus of the gland.
sistrunk’s operation is performed to excise the cyst and prevent a recurrence. It involves the
excision of the whole thyroglossal tract, involving removal of the body of the hyoid bone,
and suprahyoid tract through the tongue base to the vallecula at the site of the primitive foramen caecum along with the core of tissue on either side.",4644-2898.PNG,C,4660-2909.PNG
Q20,"A 28-year-old patient was brought to the casualty ward with high fever and pain abdomen. He had a history of bloody diarrhea for several months. His past history was negative for
long-term medications and previous surgeries. The abdominal X-ray image obtained is shown below. what is the most probable diagnosis?","a)Toxic megacolon
b)volvulus
c)ogilvie syndrome
d)pneumatosis intestinalis","The clinical scenario and the radiograph are suggestive of toxic megacolon.
Toxic megacolon may present with fever, abdominal pain, and abdominal distension. Abdominal radiography shows transverse or right colonic dilation of &gt;6 cm and loss of haustrations. It is  usually associated with ulcerative colitis as indicated by history of chronic bloody diarrhoea.
It can be triggered by electrolyte imbalance and narcotics which interfere with gut motility.
Features of secondary bacterial infecton and sepsis may be present. It can be complicated by intestinal perforation.
It usually resolves with supportive treatment (correcting electrolyte imbalance, fluids, and bowel rest) and medical therapy which includes glucocorticoids, anti-inflammatory drugs, and
antibiotics. However, an urgent colectomy is indicated in patients who do not show signs of improvement.
Indications for urgent surgery include:
• Frank intraperitoneal peritonitis, secondary to perforation
• Life-threatening hemorrhage or increasing transfusion requirements
• worsening systemic toxicity
• worsening colonic dilatation
other options:
option B: volvulus occurs when the air-filled segment of the colon twists around the mesentery. The sigmoid colon is the most commonly involved part of the large intestine (9o%). The patient



can present with abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting. X-ray abdomen shows a bent inner tube or coffee bean appearance.


option C: ogilvie syndrome, also known as colonic pseudo-obstruction is a functional disorder
with colonic dilatation without mechanical obstruction. It occurs commonly in hospitalized
patients and is associated with narcotics, bed rest and comorbid disease. X-ray shows dilatation of the colon (predominantly transverse colon) with absent mechanical obstruction.


option D: pneumatosis intestinalis is the presence of gas within the bowel wall seen in any part of the GI tract but most commonly in the jejunum. It is a pathognomic feature of necrotizing
enterocolitis. X-ray of the abdomen will show intramural gas in the bowel.",4645-2900.PNG,A,4662-2911.PNG;4662-2910.PNG;4663-2912.PNG
Q21,A USG can detect lymph node metastases in a patient with breast cancer and clinically negative lymph nodes by what percentage?,"a)5o – 6o%
b)1o – 2o%
c)2o – 3o%
d)3o – 5o%","A USG can detect lymph node metastasis in a patient with clinically negative lymph nodes by 5o-6o%.
The clinical determination of axillary lymph node metastases has an accuracy of only 33%.
Ultrasound (USG) is more sensitive than physical examination alone in determining axillary lymph node involvement during the preliminary staging of breast carcinoma.
Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAc) or core biopsy of sonographically indeterminate or suspicious lymph nodes can provide a more definitive diagnosis than USG alone.
Ultrasonography can also be utilized to image the regional lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer. The sensitivity for the status of axillary nodes ranges from 35% to 82% and specificity   ranges from 73% to 97%.
The features of a lymph node involved with cancer on USG include:
• cortical thickening
• change in shape of the node to a more circular appearance
• Size larger than 1o mm
• Absence of a fatty hilum
• Hypoechoic internal echoes",,A,
Q22,"A young boy was brought to the casualty with a history offever and abdominal pain. On examination, he was febrile and his pulse rate was 104 beats/min. The CT scan image is  shown below. which of the following signs is not seen in this disease?","a)McBurney's tenderness
b)Rovsing’s sign
c)psoas sign
d)Ballance sign","The patient's history and radiological findings are indicative of acute appendicitis. Ballance sign is not seen in acute appendicitis.



Findings on CT that are suggestive of acute appendicitis include:
• Appendiceal dilatation (&gt;6 mm in diameter)
• Appendiceal wall thickening (&gt;3 mm) and enhancement
Ballance sign is seen due to a ruptured spleen. The ballance sign is positive if there is a fixed
dullness to percussion in the left flank and shifting dullness to percussion in the right flank. The fixed dullness is due to the presence of coagulated blood near the lacerated spleen while the
shifting dullness is due to the presence of blood in the peritoneal cavity.
option A: Deep tenderness at McBurney's point, known as McBurney's sign, is a sign of acute     appendicitis. McBurney's point is a point at one-third of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine and umbilicus.
option B: Rovsing sign is seen in appendicitis. Deep palpation of the left iliac fossa may cause pain in the right iliac fossa.
option C: psoas sign is seen in appendicitis. occasionally, an in■amed appendix lies on the psoas muscle, and the patient will lie with the right hip ■exed, for pain relief.",4646-2901.PNG,D,
Q23,"A 12-year-old boy presented to the OpD with a scald injury of his arm. The lesion was pink,  oozing, and painful to moving air and touch. which of the following is the most appropriate management?","a)silver sulphadiazine cream dressing
b)Excision and grafting
c)paraffin gauze dressing
d)Collagen dressing","Scald injury (damage from contact with hot liquids) that appears pink in colour, has oozing, and   pain is suggestive of a 2nd-degree burn (i.e. partial-thickness burn). Collagen dressing is the most appropriate management for this injury.
The best dressing for burn wounds is skin; collagen is a good substitute for skin, especially in partial-thickness burns. For full-thickness burns, sequential excision and grafting should be    considered.
Initial treatment for burns includes cleaning burnt areas and removing loose dead skin. Blisters are de-roofed and an appropriate dressing is applied.
Biological dressing (collagen dressings, amniotic membrane, etc.) is the preferred dressing material, especially in partial thickness burns.
If this is not available then a non-adhesive dressing like paraffin gauze impregnated with silver
sulfadiazine (SSD) cream, colloidal silver, ionic silver cream, or silver nitrate cream can be
applied. Since increased resistance to SSD has recently emerged, it should be judiciously used and reserved for deep dermal, full thickness, infected, and old neglected burns.",,D,4665-2913.PNG
Q24,A 25-year-old pregnant women came with a history of thyroid swelling. FNAC report was   suggestive of papillary carcinoma thyroid and the nodule was “cold” on scan. which of the following will not be a treatment option for her?,"a)Total thyroidectomy
b)Total thyroidectomy plus lymph node dissection
c)Radioiodine ablation of thyroid
d)Right hemithyroidectomy","Radioactive ablation of the thyroid is an absolute contraindication in pregnancy as it can cause fetal goiter and hypothyroidism.
Radioactive ablation of the thyroid is done using the radioactive isotope of iodine (I-131), which  has a half-life of 8 days. I-131 emits gamma rays (useful in imaging) and beta particles (useful in therapy). I-131 is concentrated within the thyroid follicles and emits radiation from within the     tissue. The beta particles penetrate only o.5-2 mm of the tissue. The thyroid follicular cells are    affected from within and undergo pyknosis and necrosis followed by fibrosis without damage to neighboring tissues.
Radioactive iodine is administered as the sodium salt of I-131 dissolved in water and taken orally. Therapeutic uses of radioactive iodine:
• Distant metastasis at diagnosis (papillary or follicular carcinoma)
• Incomplete tumor resection
• patients at high risk for mortality or recurrence
• Graves disease
• Toxic multinodular goitre
The average therapeutic dose is 3-6 m curie, calculated based on previous tracer studies and thyroid size.
contraindications:
• pregnancy
• Lactation
• young age (&lt;25 years)



• Moderate to severe Graves ophthalmopathy
Management of differentiated thyroid cancer in pregnancy:
• Thyroidectomy after delivery for patients with no evidence of advanced disease or no rapid
progression and in the second trimester for patients with rapid progression or signs of advanced disease.
• Radioactive iodine is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation. If it is needed after delivery, breastfeeding shall be stopped at least 6 weeks before ablative therapy and mothers should be   advised against nursing.
• Levothyroxine supplementation: as a suppressive treatment for those who decided to postpone surgery till the second trimester or after delivery, as a replacement therapy after thyroidectomy, and as a suppressive therapy for patients with residual disease.
• Differentiated thyroid cancer not responding to radioactive iodine can be treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
Diagnostic radioiodine scan:  25–1oo μ curie of I-131 is given; counting or scanning is done at intervals.",,C,
Q25,"A 41-year-old woman underwent treatment for breast cancer of 1.2 X 1 cm with positive axillary nodes. she completed radiotherapy and chemotherapy and is now receiving
tamoxifen. How will you follow up the patient?","a)Annual mammogram
b)Regular checking of LFT once in 6 months
c)Follow-up with tumour markers once in 6 months
d)yearly bone scans","Follow-up of patients after treatment of breast cancer consists of a physical examination once in 3-6 months for the first 3 years and an annual mammogram.
Mammography is the only imaging modality necessary for follow-up after breast cancer surgery. There is currently no role for tumor markers, serum investigations, or any other imaging studies like bone scans in routine follow-ups.
Guidelines for follow-up after primary treatment:
• physical examination: every 3-6 months for the first 3 years, every 6-12 months for years 4 and 5, and annually thereafter.
• Mammography: initially, 6 months after surgery, and thereafter, annually.
• Breast self-examination: Monthly

Q26,"A patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and was discharged after removing the
drain tube on the first postoperative day. on day three, the patient came back to the hospital  and was febrile. on ultrasound examination, there was a 5 x 5 cm collection in the subhepatic space. Next best step is ______.","a)To give oral antibiotics since the given accumulation is normal
b)To re-explore the wound and insert a T-tube
c)Insert pigtail catheter for drainage
d)ERCP","The given clinical situation suggests a bile duct injury identified on post-op day 3 following
laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The next best step after imaging would be to control inflammation by drainage of fluid collection (pigtail insertion and drainage) and administration of parenteral     broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Bile duct injury
• usually is manifested in the postoperative period



• Clinical features include fever, increasing abdominal pain, jaundice and bile leakage from an incision.
Imaging: ultrasonography is done to assess for fluid collection and to evaluate the biliary tree. Treatment strategy
• Control of infection, limiting inflammation
• Percutaneous drainage of periportal fluid collections
• Parenteral antibiotics (option A)
• Clear and thorough delineation of entire biliary anatomy
• Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC)
• Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), especially if a cystic duct stump leak is suspected
• Re-establishment of biliary-enteric continuity (surgery)
• Tension-free, mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis
• Roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy other options:
option B: Re-exploration and repair in indicated for biliary leaks identified in Within 48 hours post cholecystectomy.
option D: ERCP Would be indicated if drainage using a pigtail catheter fails.",,C,4667-2914.PNG
Q27,"A 22-year-old boy was admitted to the casualty with a history of breathlessness following
massage by his mother. He had a history of hairline ankle fracture and was on a below-knee cast which was removed recently. The most probable diagnosis is","a)Pneumonitis
b)septicemia
c)Acute MI
d)pulmonary thromboembolism","The given clinical history of immobilization after the application of the cast is a risk factor for    deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Massaging the leg may dislodge the thrombus causing pulmonary



embolism (PE). It is the commonest complication of DVT leading to death.
PE and DVT are part of the same spectrum of venous thromboembolism. PE occurs due
to obstruction of the pulmonary arterial circulation by deep venous thrombi that detach from
their site of formation and embolize to the vena cava, right atrium, and right ventricle. Virchow’s triad of venous stasis, hypercoagulability, and endothelial injury, leading to recruitment of
activated platelets, provides the ideal environment for thrombus formation.
DVT presents with pain and swelling of the calf (the most common symptom), tenderness and
edema. Clinical examination is unreliable and the elicitation of signs such as Homan's or Mose's   signs is not recommended owing to the risk of clot dislodgement. Patients with symptoms of PE   present with fever, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis. on examination, they can have cyanosis, jugular venous distension, fixed split-second heart sound and pleural rub, but may be     subtle or absent. Some patients are asymptomatic.
Depending on the clinical presentation, patients with PE can be stratified as:
• High-risk (massive) PE is characterized by systemic hypotension. Patients can have dyspnea and syncope and may present in cardiogenic shock.
• Intermediate-risk PE is characterized by right ventricle (RV)
dysfunction but normal blood pressure. RV dysfunction can be diagnosed with echocardiography and ECG.
• Low-risk PE is characterized by normal blood pressure and the absence of any RV dysfunction. Investigations:
• Venous duplex ultrasound to look for thrombi in the leg.
• Chest x-ray in PE shows hyper lucency in an area of oligemia (westermark sign). D-dimer levels are elevated and ECG will show sinus tachycardia (the most common ECG abnormality) and an     S1Q3T3 sign (an S wave in lead I, a Q wave in lead III, and an inverted T wave in lead III).
• Definitive diagnosis of PE is by a CT-Pulmonary Angiography.


The management of PE will vary according to the risk stratification:



• A patient with high-risk PE will primarily be treated with anticoagulation and thrombolysis or catheter/surgical embolectomy.
• A patient with low-risk PE will be treated with anticoagulation alone, or an IVC filter as secondary prophylaxis.
• Patients with intermediate-risk PE require individualized treatment.
Anticoagulation can be done with the classical strategy of low-molecular-weight heparin followed by warfarin, or by low-molecular-weight heparin for 5 days, switched to novel oral anticoagulant  like Dabigatran after that. Fibrinolysis, if indicated, is done with recombinant TPA administered  over 2 hours. It can be done up to 14 days after the PE has occurred.
Management of DVT:
• Anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin (UFH) if renal impairment is present.
• After treatment with heparin, patients should be commenced on oral anticoagulants for at least 3 months with either factor xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban and apixaban)
or direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran).
• other measures such as rest, limb elevation and compression stockings are also used.",,D,4668-2915.PNG
Q28,A 65-year-old man has the following lesion over the face. He complains of bleeding while itching. The most likely diagnosis is,"a)Dermatofibrosarcoma
b)Marjolin’s ulcer
c)BCC
d)Naevus","The given history with the image showing an ulcer over the face with pearly, rolled-out borders points to a diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma.
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is an epithelial tumor arising from basal cells. It is the most common    type of skin cancer most commonly seen over the face, above the line joining corner of the mouth, and lobule of the ear. Risk factors for BCC include ultraviolet radiation (strongest risk factor), age  4o-8o years with excessive sun exposure, light-skinned people, and exposure to arsenic
compounds, coal tar, aromatic hydrocarbons, and infrared light. It is more common in males than females. It is also associated with syndromes such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Gorlin's
syndrome.
Features of BCC include:
• Pearly nodule with rolled border
• Tortuous telangiectatic vessels
• surface which can get ulcerated with raised and beaded edge, often with a central depression or umbilication
• Bleeding on minor trauma
BCC has various subtypes such as nodular (most common type), pigmented, nodulocystic, morphoeic, infiltrative, and fibroepithelioma of Pinkus.
It is locally aggressive and can erode the bone or facial sinuses. It rarely metastasizes via lymph nodes.



The occasional presence of melanin in the nodular variant of BCC (pigmented BCC) may lead to confusion with melanoma.
Depending upon the type of the lesion, a shave, punch or excisional biopsy may be employed for diagnosis. X-ray or CT may be needed if there is a local invasion. Histology shows peripheral
palisading of cells.
Treatment:
• Surgical: wide excision (4-6 mm clearance) with a skin graft or flap or primary suturing
• Mohs' surgery for BCC close to the eyes, nose, or ear to preserve more tissue.
• Non-surgical: Radiotherapy, vismodegib and sonedegib.
other options:
option A: Dermatofibrosarcoma, also known as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a
rare, slow-growing, well-differentiated primary fibrosarcoma of the skin, associated with increased production of platelet-derived growth factor-beta. It presents as a protuberant nodule within a
firm, indurated plaque that can ulcerate. They are locally aggressive tumors with high recurrence rates. Treatment is wide excision and Mohs microscopic surgery. Imatinib is used for
unresectable, metastatic, and recurrent tumors. The given image below shows a DFSP near the umbilicus.


option B: Marjolin's ulcer is a painless, slow-growing, locally malignant, well-differentiated
squamous cell carcinoma that occurs in a chronic scar (burns scar, scar of venous ulcer). It
presents as an indurated, non-tender ulcer with raised and everted edges with scarring in the
surrounding area with marked fibrosis. The ulcer can spread to the lymph nodes when it reaches the normal skin. A wedge biopsy and MRI of the region involved confirm the diagnosis.
Management is by wide excision, for larger ulcers, amputation is done. The given image below shows a marjolin's ulcer of the leg.





option D: Naevus is a common benign neoplasm caused due to mutations in the components of the RAS signaling pathway. It has various types, such as congenital naevus, blue naevus, Spitz
naevus, halo naevus, and dysplastic naevus. The given image below shows a patient with multiple dysplastic nevi.",4648-2902.PNG,C,4670-2916.PNG;4671-2918.PNG;4671-2917.PNG
Q29,"A 54-year-old comes to the casualty with a history of massive hemoptysis. His routine
investigation and chest X-ray were normal. which of the following you will not do to prevent hemoptysis?","a)Bronchial artery embolization
b)pulmonary artery embolization
c)procoagulant drugs
d)surgical removal of lobe","procoagulant drugs are not used to prevent hemoptysis. procoagulant drugs like vasopressin are indicated only if there is an abnormal coagulation profile.
Massive hemoptysis is generally defined as the expectoration of over 6oo mL of blood within a 24-h period.
Treatment priorities in the management of massive hemoptysis:



• First priorities are to secure the airway, optimize oxygenation and stabilize the hemodynamic status by administering IV fluids.
• chest X-ray is the first investigation of choice. cT scan is done only in hemodynamically stable patients.
• If the bleeding site is known, the patient should be placed in a lateral decubitus position with the bleeding side down to prevent aspiration into the unaffected lung. supplemental oxygen should be given.
• If large-volume bleeding continues or the airway is compromised, the patient should be intubated and undergo an emergency bronchoscopy.
• The bleeding site is localized using flexible/rigid bronchoscopy.
• control the hemorrhage:
• Endobronchially with Nd: YAG laser or bronchial occlusion
• Endovascularly with bronchial and/or pulmonary artery embolization
• Electrocauterization
• surgically with resection of the involved lobe
The cause of the hemoptysis must be determined to definitively prevent a recurrence.",,C,
Q30,"A 3o-year-old male met with an accident and came to the casualty with a contusion on the left precordium. His vitals are BP 12o/8o mmHg, RR – 16/min. Normal heart sounds were heard,  but decreased breath sounds on the left side, and the trachea deviated to the right. which of   the following is the first line of management?","a)Needle thoracocentesis
b)Pericardiocentesis
c)chest tube insertion
d)open surgery","The given clinical scenario of trauma, decreased breath sounds, and tracheal deviation with stable vitals are suggestive of a simple pneumothorax. Management involves inserting a chest tube.
Traumatic pneumothorax can be:
• simple pneumothorax - with hemodynamic stability
• Tension pneumothorax - without hemodynamic stability
Initial management of simple pneumothorax with open sucking wound involves prompt closing of the defect with a sterile occlusive plastic dressing (e.g., opsite), taped on three sides to act as a
flutter-type valve followed by chest tube insertion as soon as possible in a site remote from the injury site.
other options:
option A: Features of tension pneumothorax include hypotension, dyspnea, distended neck veins, tracheal deviation, absent or decreased breath sounds, hyper-resonant note on percussion and
normal heart sounds. The first line of management is needle thoracocentesis in the 5th intercostal space in the midaxillary line.
Definitive management - insertion of an intercostal tube in the triangle of safety. If a sucking wound is present, then it is covered with gauze pieces and taped on 3 sides.
option B and D: pericardial tamponade resembles tension pneumothorax but there is no tracheal deviation, normal breath sounds, normal percussion note and muffled heart sounds. Initial
management is by needle pericardiocentesis followed by definitive sternotomy or lateral
thoracotomy.



REMEMBER RECENT UPDATE :(Acc to ATLS 1oth edition ):
•
• In adults, the needle thoracotomy location changed to the 5th ICS mid-axillary line from the 2nd ICS midclavicular line.
• In the pediatric age group, the thoracotomy location remains at the 2nd ICS mid-clavicular line.",,C,
