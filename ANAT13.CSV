Q1,which of the following vessels is involved in the condition affecting the region marked in red in the image shown below?,"a) superior cerebellar Artery
b) posterior Inferior cerebellar Artery
c) posterior superior cerebellar Artery
d) cerebral artery","The given image is suggestive of lateral medullary syndrome/wallenberg syndrome. This may result from a stroke affecting the posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery.
The clinical findings correspond to the neuroanatomical structures affected in the lateral portion of the medulla:
• Descending tract and nucleus of CN V (trigeminal)- loss of pain and sensation over the ipsilateral half of the face.
• Inferior cerebellar peduncle – ipsilateral ataxia (gait and limb)
• Lateral spinothalamic tract – loss of pain and temperature sensation over the contralateral half of the body.
• IX and X CN - ipsilateral paralysis of palate, vocal cord, diminished gag reflex giving rise to dysphagia, dysarthria.
• Vestibular nucleus - Nystagmus, diplopia, vertigo, nausea
• Descending sympathetic tract – ipsilateral Horner’s syndrome (miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis).",323-339.PNG,B,337-351.PNG
Q2,which of the statements given below regarding the muscle shown in the image are correct?,"a) 1, 2, 3
b) 1, 2, 4
c) only 1
d) 2, 3, 4","The muscles marked in the above image are rhomboids minor and major. These muscles cause retraction and elevation of the scapula and they rotate the scapula tilting the glenoid cavity inferiorly.
Rhomboids minor and major are innervated by the dorsal scapular nerve. They are supplied by the dorsal scapular artery or the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery.
Muscles involved in movements of the scapula are:
• protraction (forward movement): serratus anterior and pectoralis minor are prime movers.
• Retraction (backward movement): Middle trapezius and rhomboids.
• Elevation: Trapezius, Levator scapulae and rhomboids.
• Depression: usually gravity alone is sufficient for the depression of the scapula.",324-340.PNG,A,338-353.PNG
Q3,Match the following:,"a) 1-D, 2-C, 3-A, 4-B
b) 1-C, 2-A, 3-B, 4-D
c) 1-A, 2-B, 3-C, 4-D
d) 1-B, 2-A, 3-C, 4-D","The correct match is as follows:

2. spinal accessory nerve - A. shrugging of shoulder
3. Glossopharyngeal nerve - C. Taste from posterior one-third of the tongue
4. Mandibular nerve - D. Chewing
Chorda tympani nerve which is a branch of facial nerve carries taste from anterior 2/3rd of the tongue.
The trapezius is innervated by the spinal accessory nerve (CN XI).
The glossopharyngeal nerve carries taste sensation from the posterior 1/3rd of the tongue.

The dorsal divisions of the s1 and s2 rami give rise to the nerve to the piriformis.
Gluteus medius and gluteus minimus act as the abductors of the hip joint. stabilizing the pelvis on the femur during walking is done by these muscles.",,C,
Q5,A 25-year-old male presented with symptoms of inability to flex the distal interphalangeal joint of the 4th and 5th digits. He was also not able to hold a piece of paper between his fingers. what is the likely site of injury?,"a) A
b) B
c) C
d) D","The given clinical situation with a positive card test and an inability to flex the distal interphalangeal joint of the 4th and 5th digits, suggests an ulnar nerve injury. The most likely site of injury would thus be medial epicondyle: site C
Injury at the medial epicondyle damages the ulnar nerve, leading to paralysis of flexor carpi ulnaris (loss of ulnar deviation) and medial half of flexor digitorum profundus (loss of distal interphalangeal joint flexion). It leads to hypothenar paralysis (lead to atrophy) and sensory loss. The positive card test is due to the weakness of palmar interossei leading to loss of adduction.
other options:
• option A: Radial groove - Radial nerve
• option D: Neck of humerus - Axillary nerve
• option B: Lateral epicondyle – May lead to tardy ulnar nerve palsy after fracture but the incidence is less.",179-172.PNG,C,

b) posterior leaflet of mitral valve
c) Aortic valve leaflet
d) Anterior aortic sinus","The marked structure is the sub-aortic curtain. It is also called the trigonum fibrosum sinistrum.
The fibrous skeleton of the heart is formed by fibrous tissue that is continuous between the atrio-ventricular and arterial orifices. They exist to keep the valves competent, allow attachment of cardiac musculature, and act as an insulating layer for the conducting system of the heart.
The trigonum fibrosum sinistrum is between the mitral valve and the aortic valve.",328-342.PNG,A,350-360.PNG

b) Gluteus medius
c) Gluteus minimus
d) sciatic nerve","A patient with dropping of the right hip on lifting the right foot off the ground, has a positive Trendelenburg’s sign. The sciatic nerve would not be involved.
A positive Trendelenburg's sign is seen in the paralysis of the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus muscles, both of which are supplied by the superior gluteal nerve. In the scenario mentioned, since the patient has dropping of the hip on the right side, the structures on the left side would be affected.",331-346.PNG,D,354-365.PNG
Q18,which of the following statements is incorrect about the anomaly shown below?,"a) It occurs due to the persistance of prechordal plate
b) It occurs due to the defective migration of primordial cells to the genital ridge
c) It contains skin, cartilage and bone
d) It is a benign tumor of coccyx","The image shows a sacrococcygeal teratoma, which occurs due to the persistence of pluripotent cells of the primitive streak in the sacrococcygeal region.
sacrococcygeal teratomas occur due to remnants of pluripotent cells from the primitive streak due to defective migration of the cells (option B). As these cells are from the epiblast, teratomas contain tissues from all germ layers which may include skin, hair, cartilage and bone (option C). These tumors are benign in nature (option D), but may rarely become malignant.",331-345.PNG,A,356-367.PNG

Q20,what is the role of the marked structure in the given image?,"a) Motor function
b) Reward-punishment
c) Judgement
d) Memory","The marked structure is the subthalamic nucleus, which is a part of the basal ganglia and is concerned with motor function.
The basal ganglia refers to the mass of grey matter located within the cerebral white matter and is responsible for a number of coordinated functions including the control of extra-pyramidal pathways for motor coordination. A lesion at subthalamic nuclei leads to loss of inhibitory effect of the indirect pathway resulting in dopaminergic overactivity responsible for features of hemiballismus.
other options:
option B: Reward-punishment is associated with the prefrontal area.
option C: Judgement is controlled by the frontal lobe.
option D: Memory is controlled by the hippocampus.",333-348.PNG,A,358-371.PNG

b) Lateral parietal lobe
c) Medial parietal lobe
d) Inferior temporal lobe","The clinical scenario suggests that the patient has visual agnosia and the likely site of involvement would be the inferior temporal lobe.
Agnosia refers to the inability to visually identify objects and is also called optic aphasia. Associative visual agnosia is the inability to visually identify objects in the absence of visual impairment, with ability to identify the object using other sensory modalities. This occurs due to lesions of occipito-temporal junction, which is present in the inferior temporal lobe.
stereognosis is the ability to identify an object by a perception of the form and nature of an object without looking at it. In the given scenario, the patient is able to recognize the object from its texture and pattern which indicates that stereognosis is intact.",,D,
Q24,Apocrine glands are present in which of the following?,"a) Face
b) scalp
c) palms and soles

• secretion of milk fat by mammary glands
• Atypical sweat glands in the axilla, perianal region, periumbilical skin, mons pubis.
