Q1,"A 3o-year-old female came to oPD with complaints of backache. on examination, schober test was positive and her eyes and nose were hyperpigmented. Probable diagnosis is","a)Hypoparathyroidism
b)Fluorosis
c)ochronosis
d)Ankylosing spondylitis","Given X-ray shows intervertebral disc calcification and hyperpigmentation of nose and eyes are present. Both features are indicative of ochronosis as diagnosis.
• ochronosis also known as alkaptonuria is an autosomal recessive disorder.
• It is due to deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase leading to accumulation of homogentisic acid.
• clinical features: Triad of
• Homogentisic aciduria (urine turns dark color on standing due to oxidation or alkalinisation)
• Eumelanin like pigmentation of skin, sclera, cartilages etc.
• Degenerative chronic arthropathies especially of spine, hip, knees.
option a: Hypoparathyroidism doesn't explain hyperpigmentation and other clinical features of hypoparathyroidism aren't mentioned.
option b: Fluorosis - dental symptoms are not mentioned and osteoporosis will be marked in case of fluorosis. Also, hyperpigmentation is not a typical feature of fluorosis.
option d: Ankylosing spondylitis – females are unlikely to be affected and it doesn’t explain hyperpigmentation.",3870-2427.PNG,C,
Q2,"A 3o-year-old woman presented with complaints of bone pain and abdominal cramps. Her
family says she has a history of abnormal behavior. The consultant doctor arrived at a
provisional diagnosis based on the clinical features. which of the following would be the best investigation to arrive at a definitive diagnosis?","a)MRI
b)ultrasonogram
c)sestamibi scan
d)CT scan","The given clinical features are suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism. sestamibi scan is the best investigation to arrive at a definitive diagnosis. parathyroid adenoma is the most common   cause of primary hyperparathyroidism.
clinical features of hyperparathyroidism:
• Bones- bone pain, pathological fractures
• stones- nephrocalcinosis
• Groans- abdominal pain
• Moans- psychotic symptoms
• Fatigue overtones- fatigue, malaise",,C,
Q3,"Based on the given image, what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)carotico-cavernous fistula
b)Pseudoaneurysm of internal carotid artery
c)Tumour blush of angiofibroma
d)Extensive head and neck hemangioma","The given image is a digital subtraction angiogram(DSA) and it shows a pseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery.
The right ICA injection anteroposterior view shows the neck of the pseudoaneurysm originating from the transverse segment of the cavernous portion of the ICA.
option A: Carotico-cavernous fistula is characterized by the premature filling of the veins as shown in the image below:


option C: Angiofibroma is characterised by tumour blush. It is the radiological enhancement of a tumour that reveals opacification of the well-vascularized tumours.
option D: Hemangioma can be differentiated from other vascular malformations by the presence of well-circumscribed mass demonstrating intense tissue staining, usually in a lobular pattern.",3871-2428.PNG,B,3875-2432.PNG
Q4,which of the following will have reduced uptake on FDG PET scan?,"a)Typical carcinoid
b)small cell carcinoma
c)Atypical carcinoid
d)Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma","Typical carcinoid is more likely to have reduced uptake on FDG PET scan than an atypical carcinoid.
The low metabolic rate of tumors makes the tumor negative (show reduced uptake) on an FDG PET scan.
Typical examples are:
• Bronchoalveolar carcinoma ( Adenocarcinoma in situ)
• Carcinoid tumour (Typical &gt; Atypical)",,A,
Q5,"A thin, 34-year-old male, presents with sharp pain and sudden onset dyspnea. chest X-ray was performed and is shown below. what is the most probable diagnosis?","a)pulmonary embolism
b)pneumothorax
c)Hydropneumothorax
d)pleural effusion","The given chest radiograph clearly depicts the presence of pneumothorax, which represents air in the pleural space.
• The right hemithorax shows blackening (depicts area of low density) due to the presence of air.
• The visceral pleural line has separated from the chest wall by a transradiant zone devoid of vessels.
• The collapsed lung can be seen with a clear border.
• There is a mediastinal shift to the left side (contralateral), which is typically seen with cases of tension pneumothorax.
All the above features are suggestive of pneumothorax.
Note: Pleural effusions signify the presence of fluid accumulation in the pleural space. The fluid may have varying degrees of mobility depending on the nature of effusion (free-flowing or
loculated).
while a small amount of free fluid is usually hard to detect on an erect PA chest x-ray, a
significant pleural effusion (2oo-5oo mL) is represented by obscured lateral and posterior
costophrenic angles and the hemidiaphragm affected. subsequently, homogenous opacification of the lower lung field develops, associated with concave superior margin relative to the lung. This     margin is higher laterally than medially.
A massive pleural effusion cause dense opacification usually associated with a contralteral mediastinal shift.


Here is an image of a left-sided pleural effusion representing the homogenous opacification of the left lower and middle lung fields. There is associated blunting of the left sided costophrenic angle. The superior border of the effusion is concave and is higher laterally than medially.",3872-2430.PNG,B,3876-2433.PNG
Q6,"A 45-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with severe back pain, vomiting, and hypotension. CT findings are given below. what is the diagnosis?","a)Renal cyst
b)Renal cell carcinoma
c)para pelvic cyst
d)Renal angiomyolipoma","The given CT image shows well-circumscribed lesions with low attenuation (black in colour) that indicate fatty tissue. This is suggestive of renal angiomyolipomas.
Angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are benign tumours that occur sporadically or in association with
tuberous sclerosis. It is commonly seen in adults between 3o and 5o years of age, with a female     predilection. AMLs predominantly affect the kidneys, though they can occur in other sites such as the liver (a common extra-renal location) and less frequently in the ovary, fallopian tube,
spermatic cord, palate, and colon.
Histologically, angiomyolipomas consist of perivascular epitheloid cells with varying proportions of vascular, immature smooth muscle cells, and fat cells. patients with AMLs present with flank   pain, a palpable mass, hematuria, recurrent urinary tract infections, hypertension, or renal
failure. Larger tumours increase the risk of complications, such as spontaneous retroperitoneal    hemorrhage, which can manifest as sudden-onset abdominal or flank pain, along with symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and hypotension.
Everolimus is used for the treatment of angiomyolipomas. Treatment should be considered for asymptomatic, growing AMLs measuring &gt;3 cm in diameter. Angiomyolipomas do not
normally require surgery unless life-threatening bleeding is present.
other options:
Renal cyst is a broader term that includes the cystic lesions of the kidney. They can be simple cysts that are benign. Complex or complicated cystic lesions need evaluation and can be
malignant. Bosniak classification is used for renal cysts. Cysts appear as hypodense lesions (greyish) with a thin wall, with or without septations.
CT image showing a simple renal cyst:


Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common malignant tumour of the kidney. It usually
occurs in the age group 5o-7o years and macroscopic hematuria is seen in about 6o% of the cases. It is a differential for angiomyolipoma but it is important to note that macroscopic fat is almost
always associated with ossification or calcification.",3872-2429.PNG,D,3877-2434.PNG;3878-2435.PNG
Q7,A 25-year-old male came with complaints of acute abdominal pain. A plain X-ray abdomen erect was taken which is shown below. what is your diagnosis?,"a)subdiaphragmatic abscess
b)pneumoperitoneum
c)pneumopericardium
d)Intestinal obstruction","The above X-ray clearly shows the presence of subdiaphragmatic free gas in the right upper quadrant. This indicates pneumoperitoneum.
causes of pneumoperitoneum include:
• Bowel perforation
• peptic ulcer
• Ischemic bowel
• Necrotizing enterocolitis.
• small bowel perforation
• Trauma
• penetrating injuries
• During surgery / laparoscopy
signs of pneumoperitoneum:
• Bowel-related signs
• Double wall sign (also known as Rigler's sign or gas-relief sign)
• Telltale triangle sign (also known as triangle sign)
• peritoneal ligament-related signs
• Football sign
• Falciform ligament sign
• Lateral umbilical ligament sign (also known as inverted ""v"" sign)
• urachus sign



• Right upper quadrant signs
• cupola sign
• Fissure for ligamentum teres sign
• Hepatic edge sign
• Lucent liver sign
• Morison's pouch sign (doge cap sign)
• periportal free gas sign",3873-2431.PNG,B,3879-2436.PNG
