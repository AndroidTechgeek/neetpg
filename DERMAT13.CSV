Q1,"A patient on Anti pD1 immunotherapy(Nivolumab) comes with pruritus, eczema, and
urticarial rashes. Histopathological examination reveals a subepidermal blister. The direct   Immunofluorescence of the lesions showed Linear c3 and IgG on the basement membrane. what is the diagnosis?","a)pemphigus vulgaris
b)Bullous pemphigoid
c)Dermatitis herpetiformis
d)pemphigus foliaceous","In the given clinical scenario history of use of Anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD1) targeted immune checkpoint inhibitors with HPE showing subepidermal split and direct
Immunofluorescence of the lesions showed Linear C3 and IgG on basement membrane is suggestive of bullous pemphigoid.
Anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD1) targeted immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab are associated with an increased risk of development of bullous
pemphigoid. Histopathology will show the presence of subepidermal bullae with
eosinophils. Immunofluorescent microscopy will show the presence of subepidermal split and deposition of IgG antibodies and C3 at the dermo-epidermal junction.
Bullous pemphigoid is one of the most common subepidermal immunobullous disorders. It is
mostly a disease of the elderly. It is characterised by a subepidermal split, with tissue-bound and   serum IgG antibodies against BP18o, more than BP 23o antigens on hemidesmosomes, necessary to maintain the structure of.
Bullous pemphigoid is associated with psoriasis and treatments of psoriasis, like phototherapy
and psoralen. There was an association seen with debilitating neurological conditions like stroke,  Parkinsonism, cognitive impairment and multiple sclerosis, and haematological malignancies like lymphomas and myeloid leukaemia. It is also precipitated by drugs like diuretics, penicillamine     and psycholeptics.
Clinical features include:
• Prodromal phase with excoriated papules, eczematous or urticarial skin lesions and haemorrhagic crusts may be seen.
• Bullous phase is characterised by:
• Intense pruritus is almost constantly present.
• symmetrically distributed tense bullae and vesicles over the flexural aspects and abdomen of the body.
• Partly haemorrhagic crusts, erythematous plaques with an annular pattern are seen.



• Lesions heal without scarring, provided there are no superinfections.
• The bullae contain clear, sometimes haemorrhagic exudates.
• Nikolsky's sign is negative.
• oral or mucosal lesions and milia formation are rare.
The image given below shows the lesions seen in bullous pemphigoid.


Histopathology will show the presence of subepidermal bullae with
eosinophils. Immunofluorescent microscopy will show the presence of subepidermal split and deposition of IgG antibodies and C3 at the dermo-epidermal junction.
The below image shows linear IgG deposits at dermo-epidermal junction seen in bullous pemphigoid.


untreated bullous pemphigoid has a chronic, self-limiting course, with remissions and relapses. Complete remissions are possible with treatment.



Bullous pemphigoid is mainly treated with topical and systemic corticosteroids. other drugs used like azathioprine, dapsone, doxycycline and immunomodulatory are also used.
other options:
option A-pemphigus vulagaris is an intraepidermal immunobullous disease. It occurs commonly between the 4th to 6th decade. They present with flaccid blisters. Firm pressure over the lesion    separates the epidermis from the dermis. Nikolsky's sign is positive. Mucosal involvement will be seen in the form of buccal and palatal erosions


option C-Dermatitis herpetiformis typically appears in the 4th decade, and the patients present with itching and rash, most typically over the extensor surfaces of the elbows, knees, buttocks,   and scalp. The majority of the patient have symptoms related to gluten-sensitive
enteropathies, like bloating, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal complaints. Immunofluorescence microscopy will show the deposition of IgA antibodies in the papillary dermis in a granular or
fibrillar pattern. Complement 3 may also be found along with the IgA deposits.




option D-pemphigus foliaceous shows antidesmoglein-3 antibodies, anti-desmocollin antibodies  and a predominance of anti-desmoglein-1 antibodies. Lack of mucosal involvement in pemphigus foliaceous, where anti-desmoglein-1 antibodies are prominent, is due to the low expression of
desmoglein 1 in the mucosa. In pemphigus vulgaris, where anti-desmoglein-3 antibodies are prominent, mucosal involvement is extensive in early stages as desmoglein 3 is abundantly   present in the mucosa.",,B,3709-2380.PNG;3709-2379.PNG;3710-2381.PNG;3711-2382.PNG
Q2,"A 24 year old young male presented with asymptomatic scaly lesions over back, symmetrical   in distribution. Images of the lesions are given, Identify the disease and the pattern of lesions","a)collaratte scale-christmas tree pattern-pityriasis rosea
b)wickhams striae-Lichen planus
c)christmas tree pattern-Lichen planus
d)wornoff ring-seborrhic dermatitis","The above description with central detachment and peripheral attachment of scales with the images suggestive of collarette scales and lesions in christmas tree pattern is suggestive of     pityriasis rosea.
pityriasis rosea/pityriasis circinata/roseola annulata is an acute self-limiting papulosquamous disorder. It is commonly seen in children and young adults.
clinical features include:
• prodrome of a sore throat, gastrointestinal disturbance, fever or arthralgia.
• Herald patch - Large and conspicuous eruptions on the thigh, upper arm, trunk or neck covered by fine scales
The image given below shows a herald patch.





• After 5-15 days, it turns into discrete oval lesions, dull pink in color and covered by fine dry silvery-grey scales.
• These secondary lesions occur as macules and papules that are elliptical or ovular, symmetric, and commonly involve the thorax, back, and abdomen.
• It is followed by a marginal collarette of scale with a central wrinkling and atrophy. The collarettes of the scales are attached peripherally. It is also called a hanging curtain sign.
The image given below shows collarette scales.

Lichen planus is an idiopathic inflammatory skin disease affecting the skin and mucous
membranes, often with a chronic course with relapses and periods of remission.patients present     with pruritic, purple, polygonal, papules. The lesions have thin white lines on their surface known as wickham’s striae. They are commonly seen on the volar aspect of the wrists, the lumbar region, and around the ankles.The mucosal involvement is seen. The commonest mucosal sites are buccal mucosa and tongue, rarely it can also be found on the anus and genitalia.





A hypopigmented ring surrounding individual psoriatic lesions is known as the woronoff ring.It is usually associated with treatment, most commonly Uv radiation or topical corticosteroids. The
pathogenesis of the woronoff ring is not well understood, but may result from the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.",3701-2372.PNG,A,3712-2384.PNG;3712-2383.PNG;3704-2374.PNG;3713-2385.PNG;3714-2388.PNG;3714-2387.PNG
Q3,"statement 1: Histopathological examination of a patient with Flaccid bulla and painful
erosions showing suprabasal blister and inflammatory infiltrate in the blister cleft. statement
2: The row of tombstones appearance is diagnostic of pemphigus vulgaris.","a)statement 1 is false and statement 2 is true
b)statement 1 is true and statement 2 is false
c)Both the statements are true but 2 is not the conclusion of 1
d)Both the statements are true but 2 is the conclusion of 1","Both statements 1 and 2 are correct but statement 2 is not the conclusion of statement 1.
statement 2 is not the conclusion of statement 1 because DIF is used for a definitive diagnosis.
pemphigus vulgaris is a chronic immunobullous disorder characterized by the presence of
antibodies against desmosomal proteins expressed in the skin and mucosa. In the skin,
desmoglein 1 is mostly seen in all layers, while desmoglein 3 is more in the lower layers. In the oral mucosa, desmoglein 3 is seen in all layers and desmoglein 1 is present in lower layers.



Clinically, the patients present with ill■defined, irregular, slow-to-heal oral lesions and
erosions. Flaccid blisters filled with clear fluid may arise on normal skin or an erythematous base. The rupture of such blisters produces painful erosions and heals without scarring. Lesions may
also involve the mucosa of the conjunctiva, nasopharynx, larynx, esophagus, urethra, vulva, or cervix.
Nikolsky's sign is positive which is elicited by applying firm tangential sliding pressure with a finger on lesional or perilesional skin. This leads to the separation of the normal■looking
epidermis from the dermis, producing erosion.
Direct immunofluorescence is considered the most accurate confirmatory test of this condition. It shows intercellular IgG and C3 deposition on the surface of keratinocytes throughout the
epidermis in normal, perilesional skin, in a characteristic fishnet/chickenwire appearance as seen below.


Histology shows a suprabasal split of the epidermis with a characteristic row of tombstone appearance as seen below.






other investigations include a Tzanck smear showing acantholytic cells. Anti-Dsg ELISA assays can be used to monitor the disease activity.

Q4,Identify the following lines in dermatology,"a)Hinderer lines
b)Marionettes line
c)Relaxed skin tension lines
d)Blaschko lines","The above image shows Blaschko lines as identified by the spiraling over the scalp. Blaschko's
lines are lines of normal developmental growth patterns in the skin. They do not correspond to
any known nervous, vascular, or lymphatic structures. Conditions that are distributed along these lines include epidermal nevi, and incontinentia pigmenti.


other options:
option A: Hinderer's lines are 2 intersecting lines—one drawn from the ala to the tragus and the other from the oral commissure to the lateral canthus.
option B: Melomental folds, or marionette lines, are one of the consequences of facial aging. The curvilinear wrinkles form because of facial movements and the aging process extend downward    from the oral commissures.
option C: Relaxed skin tension lines run perpendicular to the direction of contraction of the
underlying muscles and parallel to the dermal collagen bundles.To produce favourable aesthetic     results, incisions should generally be designed to follow rhytids or the relaxed skin tension lines as the resulting scars will be stronger and less likely to stretch.",3702-2373.PNG,D,3716-2390.PNG

b)1, 2, and 3
c)2, 3, and 4
d)only 4","Non-scarring alopecia is caused by androgenic alopecia, alopecia areata, and telogen effluvium (1,
2 and 3).  Frontal fibrosing alopecia is a type of primary cicatricial (scarring) alopecia.
Alopecia areata is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes non-scarring hair loss. It is
a T-cell-mediated inflammatory disease. It is associated with several autoimmune diseases,
including thyroiditis, lupus erythematosus, vitiligo, and psoriasis. It mainly affects the scalp, but    can also affect the beard, eyebrows, and eyelashes. In some cases, this progresses to a total loss of scalp hair (alopecia totalis) or a loss of all hair on the body (alopecia universalis).
Telogen effluvium is a type of nonscarring alopecia that is marked by diffuse shedding of normal hair. This occurs due to premature termination of the anagen phase of the hair cycle.  It can be    either acute or chronic.
• Acute telogen effluvium occurs 2–3 months after a stressful event such as high fever, surgery,
starvation, and hemorrhage. Hormonal fluctuations during the postpartum period can trigger it
(telogen gravidarum). Telogen effluvium can result in a diffuse reduction in hair density but never total baldness. It generally resolves spontaneously.
• chronic telogen effluvium is used to describe the diffuse shedding of telogen hair for more than 6 months. common causes include thyroid disorders, iron-deficiency anemia, and
malnutrition.
Androgenetic alopecia is a disorder characterized by a reduction of hair fiber production by
follicles and miniaturization. Dihydrotestosterone, an androgenic metabolite, is implicated in the etiology. It is of two types: male-pattern and female-pattern hair loss. Male-pattern hair loss
causes frontal hairline recession and thinning of the vertex.  Female-pattern hair loss involves the mid-frontal scalp diffusely. There is no or minimal involvement of the temporal region.",,B,

Q9,"An overweight 12-year old girl has the following blackish discolouration on her neck, as shown below. what is this condition and itsl association?","a)Acanthosis nigricans - Insulin resistance
b)stria Albicans - cushing syndrome
c)xeroderma pigmentosum - Malignancy
d)cafe au lait spots - Mccune Albright syndrome","The condition shown in the above image is likely acanthosis nigricans - that is strongly associated with insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia
Acanthosis nigricans is a darkening of the skin of the intertriginous areas. The hyperpigmentation is generally velvety with poorly defined borders and thickening of the skin.
It can be grossly classified into benign and malignant.
Benign acanthosis nigricans is associated with obesity or insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is the most accepted hypothesis used to explain the pathophysiology of the condition. Elevated
circulating fatty acids are considered a major factor in developing insulin resistance.
Malignant acanthosis nigricans has a rapid onset and is characterized by symmetrical,
hyperpigmented, rugose, velvety plaques. It affects the axillae and flexures, nape of the neck, and mucosal surfaces. If it occurs de novo and is associated with weight loss, malignancy should be
suspected. Generalized pruritus and skin changes of tripe palms (acanthosis palmaris) are also  associated with malignancy. Associated malignancies are generally GI or lung carcinomas. In    malignancy, tumor cells are believed to produce transforming growth factor-alpha or cytokines that activate insulin-like growth factors.
Acanthosis nigricans can only be treated by treating the underlying disease. In addition, treatment specific to acanthosis nigricans is done for aesthetic reasons. Medications like keratolytics, topical  vitamin D, and melatonin can be used. procedures like laser, dermabrasion, and chemical peels
are also available.

Q11,A middle-aged Indian man came to your OPD with the lesion as shown in the image below. The most likely diagnosis is,"a)squamous cell carcinoma
b)Basal cell carcinoma
c)LuPus vulgaris
d)Nevus","The image above shows a central ulcer with raised borders and rolled-out edges (rodent ulcer) suggesting a diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma.
Basal cell carcinoma is a slow-growing malignant tumor with locally invasive characteristics. It affects the pilosebaceous skin.
ultraviolet radiation exposure is the strongest predisposing factor. Other risk factors include exposure to arsenic, coal tar, aromatic hydrocarbons, and ionizing radiation.
Basal cell carcinoma mainly affects elderly or middle-aged men with excessive skin exposure, commonly in the age group of 4o–8o y and in white-skinned people.
Macroscopically, it is categorized as localized and generalized. Nodular, nodulocystic (nodular and nodulocystic together account for 9o% of basal cell carcinoma), pigmented, and nevoid are the
localized cancers, while superficial multifocal and superficial spreading, infiltrative, and
cicatrizing are the generalized types. The nodular type is described as pearly waxy nodules at the  margins. A central depression (umbilication) or ulceration and rolled-out edges are characteristic of basal cell carcinoma.
Sites near the eye, nose, and ear and of size &gt;2 cm are considered to be high risk. Direct invasion at these sites can reach the cranium.



Management is by Mohs microscopic surgery. Non-surgical measures, such as the administration of topical 5-fluorouracil and imiquimod, are useful. Metastasis is extremely rare.
other options:
option A: squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common malignant tumor, seen more
commonly in men. Microscopically, the proliferation of irregular masses of squamous epithelium is seen. The image is shown below.


option C- Lupus vulgaris originates from an underlying focus of tuberculosis, typically in a bone, joint, or lymph node, or maybe from the hematogenous and lymphatic spread. It presents as
a slowly enlarging plaque with an elevated border and central atrophy. The edges of the lesion
gradually extend in some areas and heal with scarring in others. In India, the buttocks, and trunk are more frequently involved. Apple jelly nodules are demonstrated on diascopy.
option D: Nevus are aggregates of melanocytes at the dermis or dermo-epidermal junction. It can get transformed into malignant melanoma and the features suggestive of malignant
transformation are a change in size, shape, color, thickness, satellite lesions, and tingling/ itching/serosanguinous discharge.",3706-2377.PNG,B,3721-2391.PNG
Q12,A Patient with several skin lesions undergoes an investigation and an image of it is shown below. what is this test?,"a)Indirect immunofluorescence
b)Direct immunofluorescence
c)Immunohistochemistry
d)Fluorescent in-situ hybridization","Direct immunofluorescence test, that is shown above, is the most accurate test to
diagnose pemphigus vulgaris.
Direct Immunofluorescence uses anti-IgG antibodies which detects the anti-desmoglein IgG
antibodies deposited on the Desmosomes. These desmosomes are present at cell junctions; this leads to the fishnet pattern.
Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) is a type of immunofluorescence that is used to diagnose
autoimmune blistering diseases, such as pemphigus. In DIF, antibodies are applied directly to a
skin biopsy specimen. If the patient has pemphigus, the antibodies will bind to the desmosomes,   which are the proteins that hold skin cells together. This binding will produce a fish net pattern of



fluorescence under a microscope.
other options:
Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) is a type of immunofluorescence that is used to diagnose
autoimmune diseases. In IIF, antibodies are first applied to a patient's serum, and then the serum is applied to a skin biopsy specimen. The presence of antibodies in the patient's serum will cause   the skin biopsy specimen to fluoresce under a microscope. seen below is a centromeric pattern on IF in sjogren's disease -1 and Diffuse/homogenous staining in sLE - 2.
Immunohistochemistry is a type of microscopy technique used to visualize the presence of specific proteins/receptors in cells or tissues. It uses antibodies that are labeled with enzymes or
fluorescent dyes to bind to specific antigens. An example is receptor identification in breast cancer specimens.
Fluorescent In situ Hybridisation (FIsH) is a simple technique for the detection of specific DNA    sequences in cells/tissues. It uses fluorescent labeled probes to bind to complementary DNA FIsH can be performed on prenatal samples, peripheral blood cells, touch preparations from cancer
biopsies, and even fixed archival tissue sections. It is used to detect
• numeric abnormalities of chromosomes (aneuploidy)
• subtle microdeletions and rearrangements.
• complex translocations that are not demonstrable by routine karyotyping
• gene amplification (e.g., HER2 in breast cancer or NMYC amplification in neuroblastomas)",3706-2376.PNG,B,
Q13,A patient presents with vesicles and oral lesions. Histopathological examination reveals suprabasal split. which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)varicella
b)IgA disease
c)pemphigus vulgaris
d)pemphigus foliaceous","The image given shows the row of tombstone appearance seen in pemphigus vulgaris.
pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune blistering disease caused by the deposition of IgG
antibodies against desmoglein 3, a protein that holds skin cells together. It is characterized by
widespread flaccid bullae, which are large, fluid-filled blisters that rupture easily. The lesions
typically start on the trunk and spread to the extremities. oral lesions are common in pemphigus vulgaris. Histologically, pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by a suprabasal split with
acantholysis (loss of cohesion between skin cells).
Acantholysis and cell apoptosis are the key pathological processes in pemphigus. Histological changes include:
• Intercellular oedema with loss of intercellular attachments in the basal layer is the earliest change
• suprabasal epidermal cells separate from the basal cells to form clefts and blisters.
• Basal cells remain attached to the basement membrane, in a ‘row of tombstones’ on the floor of the blister.
• Blister cavities contain rounded■up acantholytic cells, also seen in Tzank smears.
IgA disease (Linear IgA bullous dermatosis): Autoimmune blistering disease caused by the
deposition of IgA antibodies at the dermal-epidermal junction. It is characterized by vesicles and bullae, which are large, fluid-filled blisters. The lesions typically start on the trunk and spread to



the extremities. oral lesions are not common in IgA disease. Histologically, IgA disease is characterized by a suprabasal split with linear IgA deposition at the dermal-epidermal
junction. Anti-transglutaminase antibodies are positive in dermatitis herpetiformis. patients
present with erythematous papules and vesicles on the extensor aspect of elbows, knees, buttocks, and scalp. Histopathology demonstrates subepidermal blister formation with neutrophils located   at the tips of the dermal papillae. Direct immunofluorescence will reveal the deposition of IgA in    the papillary dermis in a granular or fibrillar pattern.
pemphigus foliaceus
pemphigus foliaceus is an autoimmune blistering disease caused by the deposition of IgG
antibodies against desmoglein 1, a protein that holds skin cells together. It is characterized by
superficial, flaccid bullae that are prone to rupture and erosion. The lesions typically start on the face and scalp and then spread to the trunk and extremities. oral lesions are not common in
pemphigus foliaceus. Histologically, pemphigus foliaceus is characterized by a subcorneal split with acantholysis and minimal inflammation.
