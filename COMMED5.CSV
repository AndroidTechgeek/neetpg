b)It is used for skewed distributions
c)It involves the assumption that the data has a normal distribution
d)It cannot be used for small sample sizes","Non-parametric tests are tests that do not assume that the data is normally distributed. Thus, they are used for skewed (asymmetric) distributions {skewed either to the lesser side (left-sided

Q8,"In a well-designed cancer study, similar remission rates were obtained for a new treatment
(33.2%) and the usual treatment (32.2%), with the p-value being o.o4. which of the following statements is true regarding the study?","a)Both the treatments are equally effective
b)Neither of the treatments is effective
c)The new treatment is more effective than the usual treatment
d)The information given is not adequate to compare the efficacy of the treatments","As the p-value is o.o4, we can conclude that the new treatment is more effective than the usual treatment.



Even though both treatments have similar rates of remission, a valid statistical test is required to determine the difference in their effectiveness. Statistically, p-value &lt; o.o5 implies that the
alternate hypothesis is true.
In this scenario, we can consider:
• Null hypothesis: Both the treatments are equally effective (in other terms, there is no difference between the effect of the two treatments).
• Alternative hypothesis: New treatment is more effective than the usual treatment.
As the p-value is o.o4, which is statistically significant (&lt;o.o5), the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted. Hence the new treatment is more effective than the   usual treatment.",,C,

Q20,which of the following is not a method of direct transmission of communicable diseases?,"a)vertical transmission
b)contact with soil
c)Droplet nuclei
d)Droplet transmission","Airborne transmission by droplet nuclei is not a method of direct transmission of diseases.
It is a method of indirect transmission of diseases.
Droplet nuclei are tiny particles of size 1-5 microns range that may be formed by either due to evaporation of droplets coughed or sneezed into the air or are formed from aerosols.
These droplet nuclei remain airborne for long periods of time and can transmit diseases like tuberculosis, influenza, chickenpox, measles, Q fever and other respiratory infections.
Droplet transmission, vertical transmission, and contact with soil are methods of
direct transmission of diseases.
Differences between droplet and droplet nuclei are summarised below:

DROPLET NUCLEI	DROPLET
Indirect transmission	Direct transmission
It is the residue from evapora ted droplets	It is produced while coughing, sneezing, talking
<5microns in diameter	≥5 microns in diameter
No need for close contact for transmission	Requires closeness and direct contact for transmission
Diseases transmitted: chicke npox, measles etc.	Diseases transmitted: diphth  eria, meningococcal meningit is etc.",,C,
Q21,what should be the minimum interval between the administration of two live vaccines?,"a)2 weeks
