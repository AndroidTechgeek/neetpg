Q1,which of the following is true regarding Mendelian mode of inheritance?,"a)Every 1oth patient has a Y-linked disorder
b)1/3rd of Mendelian disorders is autosomal recessive
c)Every 5th patient has an X-linked recessive disorder
d)2/3rds of Mendelian disorders are autosomal dominant","2/3rds of Mendelian disorders, which corresponds to approximately 66% disorders, are autosomal dominant is the true statement about the Mendelian mode of inheritance. Autosomal dominant
patterns of inheritance comprise 65% of all Mendelian disorders (monogenic human diseases). Mendelian disorders (classic inheritance)
• Autosomal dominant
• Autosomal recessive
• X-linked dominant
• X-linked recessive
of all the Mendelian disorders, also known as monogenic human disease, about 65% are autosomal dominant, 25% are autosomal recessive, and 5% are X-linked.



other options:
option A: Every 1oth patient has a Y-linked disorder - This statement is incorrect. Y-linked disorders are extremely rare, and their prevalence is much lower than 1/1o (1o%).
option B: 1/3rd of Mendelian disorders is autosomal recessive - This statement is incorrect.
Approximately 25% of Mendelian disorders are autosomal recessive, not 1/3rd (33.33%).
option c: Every 5th patient has an X-linked recessive disorder - This statement is incorrect.
Approximately 5% of Mendelian disorders are X-linked, not 1/5 (2o%).",,D,
Q2,"An elderly male who is a known smoker presented with chronic cough, significant weight loss, and fatigue. serum calcium level is raised. A lung biopsy was done, and it showed large
atypical cells with hyperchromasia. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)Large cell neuroendocrine tumor
b)small cell carcinoma
c)Adenocarcinoma
d)squamous cell carcinoma","The most probable diagnosis based on the given clinical scenario is squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.
squamous cell carcinoma is most commonly found in men and is strongly
associated with smoking. It predominantly arises in the central or hilar region. Histologically, it is characterized by the presence of keratin pearls and intercellular bridges.
Hypercalcemia is one of the most common paraneoplastic syndromes associated with squamous cell cancer (scc) of the lung. Increased levels of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-rP)  are the most likely mechanism of his hypercalcemia. The symptoms could include anorexia,
nausea, vomiting, constipation, lethargy, polyuria, polydipsia, and dehydration.
The image given below shows keratin pearls seen in squamous cell carcinomas.


other options:
option A: Large cell neuroendocrine tumor - These tumors are a subtype of large cell carcinoma and show neuroendocrine features on immunohistochemistry. They are aggressive and can be     associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, but they do not commonly cause hypercalcemia.
option B: small cell carcinoma - This is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine tumor strongly
associated with smoking. It frequently presents with paraneoplastic syndromes, including sIADH



and ectopic ACTH production, but hypercalcemia is less common. Histologically, it is
characterized by small cells with scant cytoplasm, ill-defined cell borders, and finely granular nuclear chromatin.
option C: Adenocarcinoma - This is the most common type of lung cancer and is more common in non-smokers and women. It usually arises in the peripheral lung tissue and is associated with
glandular differentiation or mucin production. Histologically, adenocarcinoma is characterized by glandular or acinar structures and/or intracytoplasmic mucin.",,D,2203-1452.PNG
Q3,"A young patient presents with a large retroperitoneal hemorrhage. He also gives a frequent
history of intermittent swelling of knees on strenuous exercise. There is no history of any mucosal bleed. which among the following clotting factors is responsible for the
above-mentioned condition?","a)Factors VIII and IX
b)Factors XI and XII
c)Von willebrand factor
d)Lupus anti-coagulant","The diagnosis based on the given clinical scenario hemophilia A. The clotting factors responsible for the above-mentioned condition are factors VIII and IX.
Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder. It occurs due to a deficiency of clotting factor VIII, which causes inadequate thrombin generation and results in the inability to form a tight fibrin clot to support the platelet plug.
Symptoms include easy bruising, intramuscular hematomas, hemarthroses, hematuria, and bleeding from minor traumatic lacerations of the mouth can persist for hours or days.
Retroperitoneal hemorrhages can accumulate large volumes of blood and may cause a
hypovolemic shock.
Laboratory findings in hemophilia A:
• Factor VIII - reduced
• partial thromboplastin time (pTT) - prolonged
• platelet count - normal
• Bleeding time - normal
• prothrombin time - normal
Mild cases of hemophilia are treated by the administration of desmopressin
acetate. Moderate to severe cases need the replacement of deficient clotting factors (factor VIII in hemophilia A). Monoclonal antibody emicizumab can restore activated factor VIII activity in
patients with hemophilia.
other options:
option B: Factors XI and XII - Deficiencies of these factors are not associated with the clinical presentation described in the question. Factor XI deficiency (hemophilia C) can cause mild
bleeding disorders, but it is generally not associated with severe hemorrhages or joint swelling. Factor XII deficiency is typically asymptomatic and not associated with bleeding disorders.
option C: Von willebrand factor - A deficiency in von willebrand factor results in von willebrand disease, which can cause excessive bleeding similar to hemophilia. However, von willebrand
disease usually presents with mucosal bleeding (e.g., epistaxis, menorrhagia, and gum bleeding), which is not described in this case.
option D: Lupus anticoagulant - This is an acquired condition seen in antiphospholipid antibody   syndrome (ApS), which can cause thrombotic events rather than bleeding. It is not associated with



retroperitoneal hemorrhage or joint swelling upon strenuous exercise.",,A,
Q4,"An elderly male went for a medical examination. Laboratory investigations showed a marked elevation of lymphocytes with marked leukocytosis. The peripheral smear of the patient is
given below. what is the appropriate next step for this patient?","a)stem cell transplantation
b)Bone marrow biopsy
c)Flow cytometry
d)start high-dose chemotherapy","The likely diagnosis based on the given clinical scenario and the peripheral smear
showing smudge cells is chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The next step in his management should be flow cytometry.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a peripheral B-cell neoplasm usually affecting adults, more commonly men. patients are often asymptomatic at diagnosis. when symptomatic, it presents
non-specifically with easy fatigability, weight loss, and anorexia. Generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are present in most symptomatic patients.
The chromosomal defects in CLL include
• Deletion of 13q (commonest and has a good prognosis)
• Deletion of 11q
• Trisomy 12q
• Deletion of 17p (poor prognosis)
The peripheral blood smear in cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) contains small round lymphocytes having condensed chromatin and scant cytoplasm. some of these cells may get
disrupted while preparing the smears, producing smudge cells. An absolute lymphocyte count of    &gt;5ooo/mm3 is required for diagnosis. Hypogammaglobulinemia is commonly seen, making the patient susceptible to infections. A few patients may develop hemolytic anemia or
thrombocytopenia due to autoantibodies made by non-neoplastic B cells.
Immunophenotyping using flow cytometry is the investigation done to arrive at the diagnosis. The classical immunophenotypic feature of CLL is CD19+, CD2o+, CD 23+, and CD5+.
on lymph node biopsy: Lymph nodes are composed of small lymphocytes admixed with larger     activated lymphocytes. The large lymphocytes contain mitotically active cells and gather in loose aggregates, which are referred to as proliferation centers. These proliferation centers are
pathognomic to CLL when present.
Expectant management is the treatment of choice for asymptomatic patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The gold standard for therapy is a combination
of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab.
Richter’s syndrome is a complication of CLL in which there is a transformation to an aggressive lymphoma, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
other options:
option A: stem cell transplantation - This is not the first step in the management of CLL. It may be considered in certain high-risk patients or those with refractory disease, but only after
confirming the diagnosis and assessing the disease stage.
option B: Bone marrow biopsy - while it can provide valuable information about the extent of
infiltration, it is not the initial test for diagnosing CLL. Flow cytometry is the preferred diagnostic method.



option D: start high-dose chemotherapy - This is not the first step in managing CLL. Treatment decisions should be based on clinical stage, prognostic factors, and the patient's overall health.
Moreover, asymptomatic patients with CLL are often managed with a watchful waiting approach.",2197-1446.PNG,C,
Q5,"A 25-year-old male presented with low hemoglobin, platelet count of 25,ooo/mL, gum
bleeding, and raised PT &amp; aPTT. The image of his peripheral smear is given below. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)AML with t(8;21)
b)AML with inv(16)
c)AML with t(15;17)
d)AML with t(11;22)","The peripheral blood smear shows numerous Auer rods in the cytoplasm of progranulocytes,    which are characteristic of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The presentation of the patient with gum bleeding points to the diagnosis of AML with t(15;17).
Auer rods (needle-like azurophilic granules) are predominantly seen in acute promyelocytic
leukemia, which is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia. It is associated with t(15;17), which
results in the formation of the fusion gene called PML-RARA. The condition is associated with a high incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Treatment includes the
administration of all-trans retinoic acid.",2198-1447.PNG,C,
Q6,A chronic smoker who worked in a cement factory for the past 2o years developed mesothelioma. The association is likely to be due to ______.,"a)silicosis
b)Asbestosis
c)coal workers' pneumoconiosis
d)Bagassosis","The association in this case is between occupational exposure to cement for 2o years and the    occurrence of mesothelioma, which is mediated by the development of asbestosis as a result of prolonged inhalation of asbestos.
Asbestosis occurs due to the inhalation of crystalline hydrated silicates (asbestos). It occurs in two distinct geometric forms, serpentine and amphibole. It is characterized by diffuse parenchymal
interstitial fibrosis. It usually begins in the lower lobes of the lungs and may present with dyspnea and cough, usually after 2o-3o years of exposure. other asbestos-related diseases include pleural   plaques, recurrent pleural effusions, lung carcinoma, and mesothelioma.
Asbestos bodies are a hallmark finding. They appear as golden brown, fusiform, or beaded rods. These are formed when the asbestos fibers are phagocytosed by the macrophages and are coated by iron-containing proteinaceous material derived from phagocyte ferritin.
The image below shows asbestos bodies.





other options:
option A: silicosis is due to the inhalation of crystalline silicon dioxide (silica) as seen in
individuals employed in sandblasting or rock mining. Macrophages phagocytose inhaled silica
particles, thereby activating and releasing inflammatory mediators, like IL-1 and IL-8.
Histopathology reveals coalescent nodules of whorled collagen fibers surrounded by a peripheral    zone of dust-laden macrophages. Radiologically, egg-shell calcification of the lymph nodes is seen. shown below is an image of a silicotic nodule with collagen whorls as seen in this condition.


option C: Anthracosis/coal workers' pneumoconiosis is a pulmonary condition seen in coal
miners. The inhaled carbon pigment is engulfed by alveolar or interstitial macrophages, which   accumulate in the connective tissue. on prolonged exposure, lung tissue undergoes progressive massive fibrosis, which is called complicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis. The upper lobes of the lungs are commonly involved.



Microscopic features consist of coal-laden macrophages, black pigment, and dense collagenous interstitial fibrosis.
The image below shows anthracosis—black pigment engulfed within macrophages as well as in the form of deposits.


option D: Bagassosis is an occupational lung disease caused by the inhalation of bagasse or
sugarcane dust. A thermophilic actinomycete, Thermoactinomyces sacchari, is the causative
organism. The symptoms are breathlessness, cough, hemoptysis, and fever. Initially, it can result   in acute diffuse bronchiolitis. If left untreated, it can progress to diffuse fibrosis, emphysema, and bronchiectasis.",,B,Picture8.png;Picture9.png;Picture10.png
Q7,A child presents with intermittent jaundice and splenomegaly. There is a history of similar    complaints in the elder brother. peripheral smear shows the following finding. How will you investigate this condition?,"a)osmotic fragility test - Hereditary spherocytosis
b)coombs test - AIHA
c)G6PD deficiency - Genetic testing
d)Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria - Flow cytometry","The most likely diagnosis based on the given clinical condition and the peripheral smear showing  spherocytes is hereditary spherocytosis. The investigation that can be done in this condition is the osmotic fragility test.
Hereditary spherocytosis is a type of hereditary hemolytic anemia that is mostly inherited in    an autosomal dominant pattern. The mutations commonly affect ankyrin, band 3, spectrin, or band 4.2.
This disorder can present at a young age with severe jaundice, anemia, and splenomegaly. The
unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia predisposes the patient to develop gallstones in early adulthood. pigment stones are found in 4o-5o% of the affected adults.
Laboratory findings include normocytic anemia with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The peripheral smear will show large spherical red blood cells without central pallor.
Laboratory investigations that are done to confirm the diagnosis:
• osmotic fragility test
• Acid glycerol lysis test



• Eosin-5’-maleimide (EMA)–binding test
• SDS-gel electrophoresis test
There is no specific treatment available besides splenectomy.
other options:
option B: Coombs test - AIHA (Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia) - This test is performed to determine if the patient's red blood cells are coated with immunoglobulins or complement,  leading to their destruction. AIHA typically does not present with a family history.
option C: G6PD deficiency - This condition is characterized by hemolytic anemia triggered by
oxidative stress, such as infections or exposure to certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is diagnosed by measuring G6PD enzyme activity or genetic testing.
option D: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria - This rare acquired hemolytic anemia is
characterized by episodes of hemolysis and hemoglobinuria, particularly during sleep. The
diagnosis is made by testing for the presence of GPI-anchored proteins using flow cytometry.",2199-1449.PNG,A,
Q8,"An African child is found to have a mass in the jaw. A biopsy of the mass was done, and it   appears as shown in the image below. The child also had a translocation of t(8;14). what is the probable diagnosis?","a)Acute myeloid leukemia
b)Follicular lymphoma
c)Multiple myeloma
d)Burkitt lymphoma","The most probable diagnosis based on the given clinical scenario and the histopathology showing a “starry sky” pattern is Burkitt lymphoma.
Burkitt lymphoma is a highly aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is characterized by the translocation of the c-Myc gene on chromosome 8. This leads to increased MYC protein
levels. The translocation most commonly seen in Burkitt's lymphoma is t(8;14).
It can occur in 3 forms that have distinct clinical characteristics:
• African (endemic) Burkitt lymphoma presents as a mass involving the mandible. It may also involve the abdominal viscera, particularly the kidneys, ovaries, and adrenal glands.
• Sporadic (non-endemic) is often seen as a mass involving the ileocecum and peritoneum.
• Aggressive lymphoma or acute leukemia is seen in immunocompromised individuals
Histopathology shows tumor cells with round or oval nuclei, coarse chromatin, small
nucleoli, minimal cytoplasm, and a high mitotic index. The phagocytes have abundant clear
cytoplasm, creating a characteristic “starry sky” pattern. Bone marrow aspiration shows tumor cells with royal blue cytoplasm containing clear cytoplasmic vacuoles.
The tumor cells express surface IgM, CD19, CD2o, CD1o, and BCL6, a phenotype consistent with a germinal center B-cell origin.





other options:
option A: Acute myeloid leukemia is most commonly seen in elderly people. Histopathology from bone marrow aspirate reveals Auer rods (needle-like azurophilic granules) in the cytoplasm of the progranulocytes. Myeloblasts have two to four nucleoli and multiple coarse azurophilic granules.
The criterion for making a diagnosis of AML according to WHo requires one of the following:
• Blast cell count of ≥2o% either in the peripheral blood or bone marrow
• Blast cell count of &lt;2o% in the presence of any one of the following three cytogenetic abnormalities t(15;17), t(8;21), and inversion 16 or t(16;16)
The peripheral blood smear shows numerous Auer rods in the cytoplasm of progranulocytes, characteristic of acute myeloid leukemia.


option B: Follicular lymphoma presents in middle age with no sex predilection. The most common presenting symptom is painless generalized lymphadenopathy. Most follicular



lymphomas have characteristic (14:18) translocation, leading to overexpression of BCL2. Lymph nodes exhibit a nodular or nodular and diffuse growth pattern.
Two cell types are predominantly present in varying proportions:
• Centrocytes - Small cells with a cleaved nucleus and scant cytoplasm
• Centroblasts - Large cells with open nuclear chromatin, several nucleoli, and modest amounts of cytoplasm
The following image shows a lymph node biopsy in follicular lymphoma:


option C: Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell neoplasm. It is associated with lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, renal failure, and acquired immune abnormalities.
Histopathological findings include
• Flame cells with fiery red cytoplasm
• Mott cells with multiple grapelike cytoplasmic droplets
• Inclusions bodies: Russell bodies (if cytoplasmic) or Dutcher bodies (if nuclear)",2199-1448.PNG,D,2210-1454.PNG;2210-1453.PNG;2211-1455.PNG
Q9,"A child presented to the hospital with cola-colored urine, hypertension, and puffiness of eyes. Laboratory investigations were done and creatinine was 2.5 mg/dL. Treatment was started,
and despite treatment, the patient did not improve for the next 3 weeks. The creatinine value  increased to 4.5 mg/dL. which among the following electron microscopic findings will be seen in this patient?","a)subendothelial deposits
b)subepithelial deposits
c)crescent formation
d)Mesangial deposits","The diagnosis based on the above clinical scenario is post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). Subepithelial deposits will be seen on electron microscopy.
The rapid decline in renal function and raise in creatinine value to 4.5 mg/dL within 3 weeks, is suggestive of PSGN progressing to RPGN (Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis). If
the histopathology finding of the patient was asked then the answer would be crescent formation, which is characteristic of RPGN. Since the electron microscopy finding in the given patient is
asked, the answer is subepithelial deposits, which is the characteristic finding of underlying pathology i.e. PSGN.



Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is caused by Group A β-hemolytic streptococcal
infections. It is uncommon before the age of 3 years and most prevalent in kids between the ages of 5 and 12 years.
The patient typically develops an acute nephritic syndrome
• 1 to 2 weeks after streptococcal pharyngitis or
• 3 to 6 weeks after streptococcal pyoderma
From asymptomatic microscopic hematuria with normal renal function to gross hematuria with acute renal failure, the severity of kidney involvement varies. Patients may experience different  levels of edema, hypertension, and oliguria depending on the extent of the renal involvement.
Laboratory findings: More than 9o% of patients see a considerable reduction in serum C3 levels during the acute phase, which lasts 6 to 8 weeks before returning to normal.
In order to confirm the diagnosis, evidence of preceding streptococcal infection is required. The antistreptolysin o titer frequently rises following pharyngeal infections. The
anti-deoxyribonuclease B level is the most effective single antibody titer to demonstrate cutaneous streptococcal infection.
Microscopic Findings in PSGN:
• Light microscopy: Enlarged, hypercellular glomeruli with diffuse mesangial and endothelial proliferation and leukocyte infiltration.
• Immunofluorescence: Granular deposits of IgG and complement C3 along the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and in the mesangium
• Electron microscopy: Primarily subepithelial humps are seen. Subendothelial deposits can be seen in early disease stages.
Below is the image showing light microscopy findings of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.


other options:
option A: Subendothelial deposits - These are characteristic of membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type I. MPGN typically presents with nephrotic or nephritic features



but does not necessarily follow a streptococcal infection.
option C: Crescentic glomerulonephritis, also known as rapidly progressive
glomerulonephritis (RPGN)is a type of nephritic syndrome associated with severe glomerular
injury with necrosis and formation of crescents. The disease progresses rapidly and leads to renal failure in weeks to months when not treated.
option D: Mesangial deposits - These are characteristic of IgA nephropathy, which typically
presents with recurrent episodes of gross hematuria following upper respiratory infections, rather than acute nephritic syndrome following streptococcal infection.",,B,2212-1456.PNG
Q10,"A patient was transfused 4 units of blood 2 hours ago, and now she complains of chest   discomfort. X-ray shows bilateral fissural thickening. which of the following is the most probable cause?","a)ABO incompatibility reactions
b)Fluid overload
c)Hypocalcemia
d)Graft-versus-host disease","The given clinical condition is most likely due to fluid overload.
Fluid overload also called transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACo) is the main cause of death from transfusion. Risk factors include older age, renal failure, preexisting fluid overload,
cardiac dysfunction, administration of a large volume of RBCs, and an excessive rate of transfusion in relation to the patient’s hemodynamic tolerance.
TACo results in dyspnea, hypoxia, bilateral and predominantly alveolar infiltrates on chest x-ray, frequent systolic hypertension, and elevated brain natriuretic peptide. Fever may also present.
Prevention involves identifying at-risk patients, close monitoring, a slow transfusion rate, and the use of diuretics in hemodynamically stable patients with a history of TACo. Treatment requires     stopping the transfusion and administrating oxygen and diuretics.
other options:
option A: ABo incompatibility reactions may present with hypotension, tachypnea, tachycardia, fever, chills, chest, and back pain, hemoglobinuria, and hemoglobinemia. In the most severe
cases, DIC, acute renal failure, shock, and death may occur.
option C: Hypocalcemia can be caused by citrate, which is used as an anticoagulant. It manifests as circumoral paresthesia, and changes in cardiac function may result from multiple rapid
transfusions.
option D: Graft-versus-host disease typically presents 5–1o days after transfusion, and it
manifests as cytopenia, fever, a characteristic skin rash, diarrhea, and abnormal liver function.",,B,
Q11,"A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of facial puffiness, frothy urine, and
hypertension. He gives a history of infection with hepatitis B. urine examination reveals
microscopic hematuria. The histopathological image of the kidney biopsy shows a spike and dome pattern. what is the diagnosis of this condition?","a)Minimal change disease
b)Membranous nephropathy
c)FSGS
d)PSGN-associated disease","The diagnosis of the patient based on the given clinical scenario and the histopathology
showing spike and dome pattern is membranous nephropathy.
Membranous nephropathy is one of the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome in adults. It occurs commonly in men aged between 3o-5o years. The majority of cases are idiopathic/primary that occur due to the autoantibodies against the renal antigen phospholipase A2 receptor. These   autoantibodies are absent in secondary membranous nephropathy.
The various conditions leading to secondary membranous nephropathy are



• Drugs: Captopril, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs, penicillamine, etc.
• Infections: Hepatitis B and C, syphilis, malaria
• Malignancy of lung, colon, and melanoma
• Autoimmune diseases like SLE, Sjorgen syndrome, sarcoidosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, etc.
As in this case, there is a history of hepatitis B infection, the likely etiology is secondary membranous nephropathy. Hence, PLA2R autoantibodies are absent.
Patients present with symptoms of nephrotic syndrome, nonselective proteinuria, and microscopic hematuria.
Diagnosis:
• Light microscopy shows diffuse thickening of the glomerular capillary wall without cellular proliferation. Irregular spikes and dome pattern on silver staining.
• Immunofluorescence microscopy shows granular deposits containing IgG and complement proteins along the glomerular basement membrane. IgG4 is the principal
immunoglobulin deposited in most cases of primary membranous nephropathy.
• Electron micrograph: electron-dense subepithelial deposits (epimembranous spikes) and effacement of foot processes of podocytes
Management is primarily by the administration of immunosuppressive drugs such as steroids, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, and mycophenolate mofetil.
Image: The silver stain of the glomerulus highlights the proteinaceous basement membranes in    black. There are characteristic ""spikes"" of the basement membrane between the immune deposits of membranous nephropathy. As the disease progresses, these spikes thicken to form dome-like    protrusions. The black basement membrane material shown here appears as projections in the
capillary loops.
other options:
option A: Minimal change disease is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children (peaks between 2–6 years).
Biopsy findings in this condition are as follows:
• Light microscopy - glomeruli appear normal (hence called 'minimal change')
• Immunofluorescence studies - no Ig or complement deposits
• Electron microscopy - diffuse effacement of foot processes of visceral epithelial cells (podocytopathy)
option C: FSGS is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. It is a
podocytopathy, with characteristic degeneration and focal disruption of visceral epithelial cells as well as effacement of foot processes. The electrophoretic pattern is more likely to yield a less
prominent band in A, a more prominent band in C as there is a fall in the level of albumin with rising in the level of α2.
The histology of FSGS reveals focal and segmental hyalinosis and sclerosis of the capillary wall. Lipid droplets and foam cells are present in the sclerosed area.
option D: Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is characterized by the sudden onset of gross hematuria, edema, hypertension, and renal insufficiency. It usually occurs following



a throat infection by nephritogenic strains of group A β-hemolytic streptococci.
Microscopic findings in PSGN:
• Light microscopy: Enlarged, hypercellular glomeruli with diffuse mesangial and endothelial proliferation and leukocyte infiltration.
• Immunofluorescence: Granular deposits of IgG and complement C3 along the glomerular basement membrane(GBM)and in the mesangium.
• Electron microscopy: Electron-dense deposits, or humps, are observed on the epithelial side of the GBM.",2201-1451.PNG,B,
Q12,"A 5-year-old child is brought with fever, fatigue, and left ventricular dysfunction. An endomyocardial biopsy is shown below. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)Acute rheumatic fever
b)chagas disease
c)pyogenic myocarditis
d)Lymphocytic myocarditis","The clinical scenario of a child with complaints of fever, fatigue, and left ventricular dysfunction, and a biopsy showing lymphocytic infiltration in myocardial tissue, is suggestive of
lymphocytic myocarditis.
The inflammatory process of the myocardium is termed myocarditis. Patients mostly present with fatigue, chest pain, cardiogenic shock, and even cardiac arrest. viruses are the most common
among the infectious causes of myocarditis. Endomyocardial biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis, and it shows diffuse, mononuclear, lymphocytic infiltration, as shown below.


Myocarditis begins with the direct invasion of an infectious agent. it subsequently replicates
within and around the myocardium, causing myonecrosis. This infiltration and replication of the infectious agent lead to the destruction of cardiac tissue.
They are treated with supportive management.
other options:
option A: Aschoff's bodies are the lesions found in the heart during acute rheumatic fever. They are composed of foci of T lymphocytes, occasional plasma cells, and plump-activated
macrophages called Anitschkow cells. Anitschkow cells have abundant cytoplasm and central



round-to-ovoid nuclei with chromatin that is centrally condensed into a slender, wavy ribbon. Hence, they are also called caterpillar cells.
This condition classically occurs a few weeks after an episode of group A streptococcal pharyngitis or, less commonly, skin infections, and Aschoff's bodies are seen in the image below.


option B: The myocarditis of chagas disease has distinctive features of the parasitization of
scattered myofibers by trypanosomes accompanied by a mixed inflammatory infiltrate of
neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and occasional eosinophils. The clusters of amastigotes  cause swelling of individual myocardial fibers and create intracellular pseudocysts. There is focal myocardial cell necrosis accompanied by extensive, dense, acute interstitial inflammatory
infiltration throughout the heart.
The image below shows the amastigotes within a myocyte (arrow) and the surrounding inflammatory response.




option C- In most bacterial infections, the heart can be involved through direct invasion and abscess formation. Causes include diphtheria, brucellosis, legionella, Meningococcus, and
Mycoplasma, and require treatment of the systemic infection.",2201-1450.PNG,D,2215-1457.PNG;2216-1459.PNG;2216-1458.PNG
