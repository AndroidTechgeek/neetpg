b) 5,4,2,3,1
c) 5,1,2,3,4
d) 1,3,4,2,5","The sequence of structures involved in the direct pathway is cortex > striatum > globus pallidus > substantia nigra > thalamus.
There are five parallel circuits that connect the frontal cortex to the striatum, pallidum, substantia nigra, and thalamus. These circuits have both direct and indirect pathways. The direct pathway stimulates the cortex to produce movement, whereas the indirect pathway inhibit it.
The cerebral cortex projects into the striatum. The striatum is seen projected into the pallidum and substantia nigra pars reticularis. In the direct pathway, striatal neurones project directly to the internal pallidum.
In parkinsonism disease, due to the death of neurons in substantia nigra activity of the direct pathway is reduced and the indirect pathway is increased. This results in bradykinesia. whereas in Huntington's disease, the activity of the indirect pathway is affected resulting in choreic involuntary movements.",,C,250-248.PNG
