Question 1,"How much drug will remain at the end of 6 hours when a patient is given 2oo mg drug, 75 mg excreted in 9o min and if the drug follows first-order kinetics?","a) 5o mg
b) 3o.5 mg
c) 12.5 mg
d) 6.25 mg","In first order kinetics, a constant fraction of the drug is excreted in a given time.
since 75 mg of 2oo mg is excreted in 9o minutes, the fraction of drug excreted in each 9o mins is 75/2oo, which is 3/8. Thus, the fraction of the drug that remains in the body is 5/8.
There will be 4 cycles of excretion of the drug (6 hours = 36o mins, and 36o/9o = 4). Thus, with a starting dose of 2oomg, the drug remaining in the body after 4 hours will be:
2oo x 5/8 x 5/8 x 5/8 x 5/8 〓 3o.5mg
Alternate way to calculate:
75 mg of 2oo mg is excreted in 9o minutes, thus 75/2oo 〓 o.375 is eliminated
After 9o minutes; 2oo mg-75 mg 〓 125 mg remains.
The second 9o minutes (after 18o minutes) 〓 125 x o.375 〓 46.875 mg is eliminated, and 125-46.875 〓 78.125 mg remains
The third 9o minutes (after 27o minutes) 〓 78.125 x o.375 〓 29.297 mg is eliminated, and 78.125-29.297 〓 48.828 remains
The fourth 9o minutes (after 36o minutes) 〓 48.828 x o.375 〓 18.31o mg is eliminated, 48.828-18.31o 〓 3o.518 mg remains after 6 hours.",,B,
Question 2,what is the most bactericidal anti leprotic drug amongst the given drugs?,"a) Amoxicillin
b) Ciprofloxacin
c) ofloxacin
d) Erythromycin","ofloxacin is the most bactericidal anti leprotic drug amongst the given drugs.
It exhibits high activity against M. leprae, and it is being used in alternative multidrug therapy (MDT) regimens in rifampicin-resistant cases. As a component of MDT, it has been found to hasten the bacteriological and clinical response.
Among the macrolides, clarithromycin has activity against leprosy bacilli and is used for alternative MDT in cases resistant to both rifampicin and fluoroquinolones. Azithromycin shows activity against Mycobacterium avium complex but not lepra bacilli.
Note: Rifampicin is the most potent bactericidal anti leprotic drug.",,C,
Question 3,which of the following is not true about P-glycoprotein?,"a) Pgp stands for permeability glycoprotein
b) Also known as CD243
c) Also known as ABCB1
d) Also known as MDR2","P-glycoprotein is also known as multidrug resistance protein 1 or MDR1 (not MDR2). It is also denoted by cluster of differentiation 243 (CD243).
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is one of the first members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, which acts as an efflux membrane transporter. It is responsible for limiting cellular uptake and the distribution of xenobiotics and toxic substances. It is associated with multidrug resistance (MDR).
• Increased P-gp expression: Reduces the absorption of drugs that are substrates for P-gp
• Decreased P-gp expression: Leads to supratherapeutic plasma concentrations and drug toxicity",,D,
Question 4,"For which of the following drugs, is absorption increased after a fatty meal?","a) Griseofulvin
b) Amphotericin B
c) Ampicillin
d) Aspirin","The absorption of griseofulvin is increased after a fatty meal.
Note: Fatty meals increase the rate of absorption of efavirenz to such an extent as to cause toxicity. Hence, efavirenz is recommended to be taken on an empty stomach.
Drug absorption reduced /del ayed by food: Ampicillin, Aspirin, Atenolol, Azithromycin, captopril, Indinavir, Isoniazid, Rifampin, sucralfate, Tetracycline, Doxycycline
Drug absorption increased by food: Atovaquone, carbamazepine, chlorothiazide, cefuroxime, Diaz epam, Ganciclovir, Lithium, Met oprolol, Ritonavir, Hydralazine, Lumefantrine",,A,
Question 5,A patient with prinzmetal angina is administered isosorbide mononitrate and is noticed to have symptomatic relief. what is the mechanism of action of nitrate in this case?,"a) Endothelium independent coronary vasodilation
b) Reduced cardiac contractility
c) Increased left ventricular end diastolic volume
d) Decreased diastolic perfusion pressure","The mechanism of action of nitrates in prinzmetal angina is endothelium-independent coronary vasodilatation.
Prinzmetal angina occurs due to vasospasm of the coronary arteries. Nitrates relax the smooth muscles of epicardial coronary arteries and relieve coronary artery spasm.
In the case of stable angina, the primary mechanism of action of nitrates is preferential dilatation of veins (by increasing cGMP). Venous dilatation leads to a decrease in the venous return to the heart (preload). This decreases the ventricular end-diastolic volume and thereby a decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption. The diastolic perfusion pressure (aortic blood pressure in diastole - left ventricular pressure in diastole) is increased.",,A,
Question 6,The drug of choice in anaphylactic shock is?,"a) Adrenaline o.5 mg 1/1ooo IM
b) Adrenaline 1 mg 1/1oooo IV
c) Atropine 3 mg
d) Adenosine 6 mg followed by 12 mg IV","Adrenaline o.5 mg 1/1ooo by intramuscular route (IM) is the drug of choice for treatment of anaphylactic shock. Hence it is the answer here.
In case the patient develops life threatening condition, adrenaline o.25 mg IV is given.
Note : This is a controversial question. The following inference from journal may help to clarify the concept.
• As vasodilatation is the main pathological change early in anaphylaxis, this enables the subcutaneous or intramuscular absorption of adrenaline to be rapid and effective.
• Thus, when the disease is treated early and is progressing slowly, or venous access is difficult or the patient is unmonitored, intramuscular adrenaline has advantages in terms of safety and is usually effective.
• Later, when intravascular volume is depleted and shock occurs with a life threatening situation, or there is severe dyspnoea or airway compromise, the intravenous route is necessary to achieve optimal absorption.",,A,
Question 7,what instruction do you give to a mother who is lactating for drug use?,"a) No advice as most of drug are not present in breast milk
b) Give longer half-life drugs
c) Tell the mother to feed when it is least efficacious
d) To feed just before the next dose, when the plasma concentration of the drug would be the least","Ideally, the mother should feed just before the next dose, when the plasma concentration of the drug would be the least.
• The drugs are present in breast milk in variable amount but lesser than in plasma of mother.
• Breastfeeding is advised at least 3-4 hours after drug intake so that plasma concentration is lesser and hence the concentration in the breast milk is also less.",,D,
Question 8,"In a case of acute exacerbation of asthma, salbutamol was given, however, no improvement was noticed. Intravenous corticosteroids and aminophylline were given and the condition improved. what is the probable mechanism by which the corticosteroids would have improved the condition?","a) corticosteroids increase bronchial responsiveness to salbutamol
b) corticosteroids cause direct bronchodilatation when used with xanthines
c) corticosteroids indirectly increase the effect of xanthines on adenosine receptor
d) corticosteroids increase mucociliary clearance","corticosteroids improved the condition by increasing the airway responsiveness to salbutamol. Mechanism of action of corticosteroids in an acute asthma attack:
• Increases responsiveness to β-2 agonists
• Decreases mucous secretion
• Decreases inflammatory cell response.
steroids increase the transcription of β-2 receptor genes and hence increases responsiveness to β-2 agonists.
β-2 agonists increase the effect of steroids by enhancing the action of glucocorticoid receptors. Theophylline increases the effects of steroids by activating the enzyme histone deacetylase which is the target for steroids as well.
Note: As per recent GINA 2021 guidelines, aminophyllines are no longer preferred in the management of acute severe asthma due to their low efficacy and poor safety profile.",,A,
Question 9,which of the following opioids is a partial agonist at mu and a full agonist at kappa receptors?,"a) pentazocine
b) Buprenorphine
c) Tramadol
d) Fentanyl","pentazocine is a partial agonist at mu and a full agonist at kappa receptors.
Analgesia produced by pentazocine is predominantly mediated by the κ receptor.
pentazocine is a mixed agonist-antagonist opioid agent. It is a full agonist at the κ receptor and a partial agonist or weak antagonist at the μ receptor
Note: Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at mu receptors but an antagonist at kappa receptors",,A,

Question 12,what is the mechanism of action of vancomycin?,"a) cell wall synthesis inhibition
b) cell membrane inhibition
c) Peptide synthesis inhibition
d) 5os ribosome inhibition","The mechanism of action of vancomycin is cell wall synthesis inhibition.
The bacterial cell wall has long chains of peptidoglycan and is cross-linked to each other by the action of the enzyme transglycosylase. vancomycin is a glycopeptide group of antibiotics that binds to the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of the synthesized peptidoglycan. This inhibits the transglycosylase enzyme and prevents elongation and cross-linking of peptidoglycan. This leads to the weakening of the cell wall causing lysis.
It exhibits a time-dependant or concentration-independent killing of bacteria. It primarily acts on Gram +ve organisms which are resistant to other antibiotics such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus and ampicillin resistant enterococci.
Lipoglycopeptides are a new generation of glycopeptide congeners which include telavancin, dalbavancin, and oritavancin. Dalbavancin and oritovancin are administered as a single intravenous dose for skin and soft-tissue infections.",,A,990-726.PNG

Question 31,A patient was treated for septicemia with norepinephrine infusion. which of the following best explains the benefit of this drug?,"a) Bradycardia
b) Tachycardia
c) Increases urine output
d) Increases mean arterial blood pressure","The benefit of using noradrenaline in septicemia is that it increases the mean arterial blood pressure. It acts as a powerful peripheral vasoconstrictor and inotrope.
Noradrenaline causes a rise in both systolic BP and diastolic BP, resulting in a rise in the mean arterial blood pressure. This increases the organ perfusion in patients in septic shock or cardiogenic shock.
Another advantage of noradrenaline is that it does so without causing tachycardia, which is often a troublesome event with other inotropes in critical care.
options A and B: The rise in mean arterial pressure causes reflex bradycardia which is not a major contributor to the treatment of septic shock.
option c: Low-dose dopamine infusions and furosemide are used to increase urine output in critically ill patients.",,D,
Question 32,which of the following suggests storage of drugs in tissue?,"a) Excretion in saliva
b) Excretion in urine
c) Large volume of distribution
d) small volume of distribution","storage of drug in tissue suggests large volume distribution.
