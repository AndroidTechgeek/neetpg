Q1,In which of the following conditions is the given X-ray finding seen?,"a)Esophageal atresia
b)Esophageal stenosis
c)Reflux esophagitis
d)Barrett's esophagus","The given image is a barium swallow X-ray showing a feline esophagus suggestive of reflux esophagitis.
The feline esophagus is also known as esophageal shiver. These folds are 1-2 mm thick and run    horizontally around the entire circumference of the esophageal lumen. It is thought to be due to   the contraction of the muscularis mucosae of the esophagus. This results in the shortening of the esophagus and the bunching up of the mucosa in the lumen.
The appearance is almost always associated with active gastroesophageal reflux. The findings are transient, seen following reflux and not during swallowing. The appearance is confined to the
distal two-thirds of the thoracic esophagus.
It can also be seen in hiatus hernia and eosinophilic esophagitis. Here, the folds are permanent and associated with strictures.",3905-2455.PNG,C,
Q2,Identify the structure marked in the CT scan shown below:,"a)Descending aorta
b)Ascending aorta
c)superior vena cava
d)Right pulmonary artery","The structure marked in the given CT thorax image is the superior vena cava.
The image below depicts all the major structures labelled in the CT thorax image:",3906-2457.PNG,C,3913-2464.PNG
Q3,what condition causes the skull appearance as in the given radiograph?,"a)Hyperparathyroidism
b)Multiple myeloma
c)Hyperthyroidism
d)paget's disease","The given X-ray of the skull shows multiple radiolucent lytic lesions, typical of the salt and pepper appearance (pepperpot appearance). This is seen in hyperparathyroidism.
In hyperparathyroidism, there is resorption of the trabecular bone of the skull (which causes the    radiolucent areas) in combination with cystic areas of osteopenia. There is also a loss of definition between the inner and outer tables of the skull.
other options:
option B: In multiple myeloma, multiple well-defined ""punched out"" lytic lesions exist.
option C: untreated hyperthyroidism for several years can lead to osteoporosis of bones.
option D: In paget's disease, the pelvis, spine, skull, and proximal long bones are most frequently affected. Radiological skull changes include:
• osteoporosis circumscripta: Large, well-defined lytic lesion
• Cotton wool appearance: Mixed lytic and sclerotic lesions of the skull
• Diploic widening: Both inner and outer calvarial tables are involved, with the former usually more extensively affected
• Tam o'shanter sign: Frontal bone enlargement, with the appearance of the skull falling over the facial bones, like a Tam o'shanter hat",3906-2456.PNG,A,
Q4,what dye is used for the diagnosis of esophageal perforation?,"a)Gastrograffin
b)Iohexol
c)Gadolinium
d)Barium sulphate","Iohexol is the contrast medium used for the diagnostic work-up for a suspected esophageal perforation.



Although gastrograffin (water-soluble) was used previously, it has a high chance of causing
aspiration pneumonitis and pulmonary edema consequently. Hence it is not preferred nowadays. (option A)
Barium contrast is not used in esophageal perforation as it causes barium-related inflammation of the mediastinum. (option D)
Given below is a plain chest radiography with a water-soluble contrast swallow, showing contrast leakage in a patient with spontaneous rupture of the esophagus.

Contraindications to the use of barium contrast	Alternative dyes used
Tracheoesophageal fistula	Dianosil- water-soluble, non-i onic agent
Esophageal perforation	Iohexol

Q5,A 5o-year-old patient has come with sudden onset of chest pain and his CT scan shows the following picture. what is the diagnosis?,"a)pulmonary embolism
b)Aortic dissection
c)Aortic aneurysm
d)Myocardial infarction","The given CT scan showing a double lumen and dilatation of the aorta is suggestive of an aortic dissection.
In this condition, blood enters the space below the intima of the aorta. This results in the
formation of a true lumen and false lumen. The true lumen is often the smaller of the two because of being compressed by the false lumen, as shown below.





The beak sign in aortic dissection is a reliable sign to identify the false lumen. It refers to the acute angle formed at the edge of the false lumen in aortic dissection in axial cross-section. It is formed  by the borders of the outer aortic wall and the intimal flap, and maybe partially thrombosed
(blunted beak).",3907-2458.PNG,B,3915-2467.PNG;3915-2466.PNG
Q6,The following scan is of a young woman on oral contraceptives. The most likely diagnosis is:,"a)Hepatocellular carcinoma
b)Metastatic infiltrates
c)Hepatic adenoma
d)Hemangioma","The image given is of hepatic adenoma.  It is the most frequent hepatic tumour in young women on oral contraceptive pills.
Hepatic adenomas, also referred to as hepatocellular adenomas, are benign liver tumours. They are well-defined vascular lesions, which are generally solitary. They are almost always seen in     women between the age of 25 and 5o years and are associated with the use of the oral
contraceptive pill.



on CT, uncomplicated adenomas are usually homogeneous, with a well-defined margin. They
enhance markedly and uniformly during the arterial phase and then merge with the surrounding liver during the portal phase.
Hepatic adenoma on the CT scan is shown below.


other options:
option D:  on contrast-enhanced CT scan, hemangiomas show asymmetrical, nodular peripheral enhancement that is isodense with large vessels and progressive centripetal enhancement. Liver   hemangioma on CT scan is shown below.


option B: Most metastatic deposits appear as areas of low attenuation on unenhanced CT and
portal-phase CT. Hypervascular tumours are often visible as low-attenuation lesions on
unenhanced images and may enhance transiently in the arterial phase, some becoming invisible in the portal phase. Metastatic infiltrates in the liver in the portal phase on CT scan are shown
below.





option A: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) typically shows a decreased signal on T1-weighted     images and a moderately increased signal on T2-weighted images, with internal heterogenecity. MRI is regarded as the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting HCC. Given below is the   MRI image of HCC:",3908-2460.PNG,C,3916-2469.PNG;3916-2468.PNG;3917-2471.PNG;3917-2470.PNG
Q7,A child presents with a left-to-right shunt and high-output cardiac failure. The following is his MRA. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)vein of Galen malformation
b)Dandy walker syndrome
c)pneumocephalus
d)venous sinus thrombosis","The MR-Angiography shown is of vein of Galen Malformation.
vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations (vGAM's), also known as median prosencephalic arteriovenous fistula, are uncommon intracranial anomalies that tend to present in early    childhood with features of a left-to-right shunt and high-output cardiac failure.



The vein of Galen, also known as the great cerebral vein or great vein of Galen, is a short trunk    formed by the union of the two internal cerebral veins and basal veins of Rosenthal. It lies in the quadrigeminal cistern. It curves backwards and upward around the posterior border of the
splenium of the corpus callosum and drains the anterior and central regions of the brain into the sinuses of the posterior cerebral fossa.
The following image shows the vein of Galen:",3908-2459.PNG,A,3918-2472.PNG
Q8,what is the diagnosis based on the given image?,"a)uterus didelphys
b)Bicornuate uterus
c)unicornuate uterus
d)septate uterus","The given image shows the hysterosalpingogram of a unicornuate uterus.
The endometrial cavity usually assumes a fusiform (banana type) shape, tapering at the apex and draining into a single fallopian tube. The uterus is generally shifted off the midline.",3909-2461.PNG,C,
Q9,The Bragg peak effect is pronounced in:,"a)X ray
b)proton
c)Neutron
d)Electron","The Bragg peak effect is pronounced in protons.
The proton is a heavy and charged particle that gradually loses its speed as it interacts with
human tissue. It is easily controlled and delivers its maximum dose at a precise depth and can go  as far as 32 cm. The absorbed dose increases very gradually with greater depth and lower speed,   suddenly rising to a peak when the proton is ultimately stopped. This is known as the Bragg peak.
The behavior of the proton can be precisely determined, and the beam can be directed, allowing the Bragg peak to occur within the tumor site. Immediately following this burst of energy, the     protons cease radiating and come to a complete stop. This property of proton therapy enables     targeting tumors within the body, delivering radiation directly to the tumor while sparing the
surrounding healthy cells, offering a much less invasive alternative to treat cancer.

Q10,The image seen below shows_______.,"a)Magnetic Resonance Imaging
b)positron Emission Tomography
c)Hysterosalpingography
d)Laparoscopic chromopertubation","The image given is of the findings seen in hysterosalpingography. The given image shows bilateral retort-shaped fallopian tubes, indicating bilateral hydrosalpinx.
Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is a technique used for visualization of the uterine cavity and
fallopian tubes by the injection of a radioopaque dye, and visualization of the dye by fluoroscopy as it passes through the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes.
It is best performed between the end of the menstrual period and ovulation (i.e. 9th or 1oth day of the cycle). 1o-15ml of the dye is injected using a Leech-wilkinson cannula, Rubin's cannula, or
Foley's catheter. If the tubes are patent, the dye will spill out of the tubal ostia and smear the adjacent bowel.
It is used to detect:
• Tubal block: This can be due to strictures (fibrotic block), inspissated amorphous material, or spasms. The tubal spasm can occur in an apprehensive woman, and this is prevented by
premedication with atropine and analgesia.
• uterine anomalies
• uterine polyps
• uterine synechiae
• The feasibility of tuboplasty, by studying the location and extent of tubal pathology.
contradictions:
• presence of genital tract infection and bleeding
• Genital tuberculosis, due to the risk of spreading infection.



• Suspected pregnancy
• Allergy to the dye
• premenstrual phase (there is a risk of embolism and endometriosis if HSG is done during this phase).
The image given below shows the appearance of a normal hysterosalpingogram.


Laparoscopic chromopertubation is a laparoscopic procedure for establishing the patency of fallopian tubes or verifying the findings of blocked tubes on HSG. Methylene blue is injected through the cervix to visualize the free spill. The absence of spill indicates blocked tubes.",3910-2463.PNG,C,3920-2474.PNG
Q11,Identify the artery marked by blue arrow.,"a)superior mesenteric artery
b)Inferior mesenteric
c)celiac artery
d)Intestinal artery","The artery marked by the blue arrow is the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), which gives rise to various branches that supply the small intestines, cecum, ascending, and part of the transverse    colon.
The CT also depicts nutcracker syndrome, a left renal vein entrapment syndrome characterized by extrinsic compression of the left renal vein (marked by a red arrow), most commonly between the  abdominal aorta and superior mesenteric artery. This syndrome is one of the postulated reasons    for left-sided varicoceles being more common than the right side.",3910-2462.PNG,A,
Q12,what is the probable diagnosis based on the image of the scan given below?,"a)pituitary apoplexy
b)pituitary macroadenoma
c)Rathke cleft cyst
d)craniopharyngioma","The given MRI of the brain demonstrates a craniopharyngioma, which is a suprasellar tumour that arises from remnants of Rathke's pouch.
The two variants of craniopharyngioma are:



• Adamantinomatous type (common in children):  predominantly solid with cystic components. Diagnostic features include compact lamellar keratin (""wet keratin"") and areas of dystrophic
calcification.
• papillary type (common in adults): contains both solid sheets and papillae lined by well-differentiated non-keratinized squamous epithelium.
These tumours are usually large and heterogeneous, displaying solid and cystic components. The cysts contain a cholesterol-rich, thick brownish-yellow fluid that is compared to 'machine oil'.
clinical features include headaches (most common), visual abnormalities - decreased acuity    and bitemporal hemianopia, GH deficiency, growth failure, delayed sexual maturation due to pituitary hypofunction, and polyuria (central diabetes insipidus).
Radiologically:
• cT may show calcifications associated with the solid and cystic wall components
• MRI is the imaging modality of choice which shows:
craniopharyngiomas tend not to expand the pituitary fossa unless they become huge, which is a differentiating feature from pituitary macroadenomas.
other options:
option A: pituitary apoplexy is an acute clinical condition associated with the rapid expansion of the pituitary gland, which is evident on an MRI as enhancement around a non-enhancing
infarcted centre.
option B: pituitary macroadenoma (with cystic degeneration or necrosis) shows indentation at the diaphragma sellae, giving rise to a snowman/figure of eight appearance/cottage loaf. calcification   is often absent. The image below shows the snowman appearance:

cysts	
T1	Iso to hyperintense to the bra in (due to high protein conte   nt ""machinery oil cysts"")
T2	Mostly hyperintense
solid compon ent	
T1	vivid enhancement
T2	variable or mixed






option C: Rathke cleft cyst shows no solid or enhancing component. Calcification is rare. It is unilocular and the majority are completely or mostly intrasellar.",Picture43.png,D,Picture44.png
