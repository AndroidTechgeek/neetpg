Q2,A middle-aged man was brought to the ER after an assault with a sharp axe. Identify the type of wound?,"a)Incised wound
b)chop wound
c)Lacerated wound
d)Abrasion","The given wound caused by an axe, is likely to be a chop wound.
Chop wounds are so-called because of the action in which they are produced. Depending on the  type of instrument, they may resemble an incised or a lacerated wound. The shape of the wound may give clues to the type of weapon. It would be a deep, well-margined wound, gaping with
limited damage to the surrounding skin.
For example, in the given image, the wound resembles an injury produced by a sharp axe. Such wounds may be inflicted with homicidal intent on the skull/scalp.",2699-1644.PNG,B,
Q3,"A patient comes to the casualty with life-threatening injuries. There was no time for taking consent. The doctor started doing life-saving procedures with all precautions, and despite   best efforts, the death of the patient occurred. The doctor is not responsible under which    doctrine?","a)Res ipsa loquitor
b)Doctrine of anticipation
c)Doctrine of extended consent
d)Doctrine of conjugated consent","under IPC 92, the doctor can perform life-saving procedures in a patient with life-threatening    injuries without obtaining consent. The guiding principle is whether the delay in treatment in    order to obtain consent would result in harm to the patient. This is the doctrine of anticipation.
under some circumstances like emergencies, informed consent may be neither possible nor necessary.
IPC 92 states that nothing is an offense by reason of any harm which it may cause to a person for  whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without that person’s consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of him from whom it is possible to  obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit.
other options:
'Res Ipsa Loquitor' means 'the thing or fact speaks for itself'. It is obvious evidence for the   negligent act committed. For example, swabs left in the abdominal cavity post laparotomy.
The doctrine of extended consent: It is used in unanticipated conditions during surgery. This
comes into play when a surgeon encounters an unanticipated abnormality within the field of
surgery. It is called the “extension doctrine,” and it assumes that the surgeon is using reasonable    judgment. For example, a surgeon incurred no liability for draining some ovarian cysts during the course of an appendectomy. The condition must be one that was unforeseen, and the patient must not have expressly refused such an intervention.
Doctrine of conjugated consent - Dummy option (No such consent has been defined).",,B,
Q4,which of the following is false regarding the management of snakebite in India?,"a)Atropine and neostigmine are very useful in the management of krait bite
b)Neostigmine and ventilatory support are used in treatment along with ASV
c)ASV is the mainstay of treatment
d)current ASV in India is not effective against humped pit viper","Atropine is not useful in the management of krait bite. The toxin in common krait's venom acts presynaptically, hence atropine is not used in the treatment of envenomation by krait.
As the cobra venom acts postsynaptically, atropine can be used in the management.
ASV(Anti Snake Venom) is the mainstay of snakebite treatment.
ASV used in India is effective against:



• cobra
• common krait
• Russel viper
• saw scaled viper
Neostigmine and ventilatory support are used in the treatment of snakebite.",,A,
Q5,"A 14-year-old girl comes to the OPD with her mother. History of penovaginal penetration by    the neighbour is reported to the doctor. The girl admits to giving the neighbor the consent for the same and says she does not want to be examined. As a medical officer, which of the
following should you do?","a)1,2,3 are true
b)2,3,4 are true
c)1,3,5 are true
d)3,4,5 are true","In the given scenario 1, 3, 5 are true.
The scenario describes a 14-year-old girl with a history of sexual intercourse with her neighbor  albeit with consent. consent for intercourse is valid only after 18 years in an unmarried girl. As she is less than 18 years, it is presumed to be a medicolegal case of sexual assault.
Examination of a victim of sexual assault should be done after the consent of the victim (if she is less than 12 years of age or unsound mind, consent from the guardian needs to be taken). If she   denies examination, counseling has to be done regarding the need for examination and how it
could be held up against her in the court of law. If she still refuses for part or whole of
examination or sample collection, an informed refusal needs to be documented.
Information to the police is given in all medicolegal cases.",,C,
Q6,"A surgeon performs a hysterectomy for uterine fibroids after obtaining relevant informed consent from the patient. Despite adequate precaution, the ureter was injured
intraoperatively. under which of the following principles will the doctor not be held responsible for this act?","a)Novus actus interveniens
b)Medical maloccurrence
c)Res ipsa loquitur
d)Physician error","The doctor will not be responsible for the above act under medical maloccurrence.
Medical Maloccurrence/Inevitable Accident: Every human being responds differently to different drugs as well as to different treatment modalities. on certain occasions, despite all proper care
given by the doctor during treatment, the patient fails to respond properly or may suffer some
adverse reactions to the drug which may lead to severe injuries or permanent deformities. This is known as a medical maloccurrence/inevitable accident.
If the doctor can prove this before the court, it will be an absolute defence against malpractice.
'Res ipsa loquitur' means 'the thing or fact speaks for itself'. It is obvious evidence of the negligent act committed. For example, swabs left in the abdominal cavity post laparotomy.
'Novus actus interveniens': This essentially means that the negligence at the core of the lawsuit
stems from the actions of a third party and that this negligence was unforeseeable. The viability of this defence heavily relies on the specific details of each case. For instance, if a doctor writes a
prescription that is allegedly illegible, and the pharmacist misreads it, fails to verify it with the
doctor, and then dispenses the wrong medication to the patient, resulting in an injury, the doctor might use this defence in such a scenario.",,B,
Q7,The punishment for the death of a patient by spurious drug:,"a)5 years
b)7 years
c)Life imprisonment
d)1 year","The punishment for the death of a patient by a spurious drug is imprisonment for life.
In case of an adulterated, spurious, or any drug that when used by any person for or in the
diagnosis, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of any disease or disorder is likely to cause ill
health or is likely to cause such harm on his body as would amount to grievous hurt within the  meaning of section 32o of IPC, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term that shall not be less than 3 years but that may extend to a term of life.",,C,

b)Nigella sativa
c)Datura seeds
d)opium seeds","The seeds shown in the given image are of the plant Nigella sativa. These are also known as black cumin or kalonji.
The seeds are the most commonly used parts of the plant in traditional medicine. seeds have a
pungent and bitter taste with a considerable amount of oil inside. The seeds are used as a spice in  cooking. They are also used as a food preservative and the most often used therapeutic agent is its oil.",2701-1646.PNG,B,
Q9,"A 12-year-old boy presents with the following injury that he sustained on being tackled by an opponent during the course of a football match. As the casualty medical officer, you would    enter the wound description in the case sheet as ____________________","a)Incised wound
b)Abrasion
c)Laceration
d)Bruise","The given image shows a laceration.
A laceration is a tear or a split in the skin, mucous membrane, muscle, or any internal organ, with a depth spanning more than the covering epithelium of the skin or an organ, and is produced by    blunt force.
Features of laceration:
• Margins are irregular with pieces of tissue attached in between called tissue tags or bridges
• Bruising is seen around the margin
• Deeper tissues are unevenly divided with tissue tags
• Hair bulbs are crushed
• Depth of the wound contains abundant foreign material such as dust particles, paint material of the vehicle involved, etc
• In skin lacerations, usually one of the margins overhangs the other, which could help in assessing the direction of the force
• A laceration, on healing, produces a permanent scar.
Classification of a laceration:
• split laceration (incised - like laceration)
• This occurs when the skin is crushed between two hard objects
• For example, during a fall, the scalp gets crushed between the skull from inside and hard ground outside. This results in a wound, which usually mimics an incised one unless examined closely.
• stretch laceration



• As the name implies, it occurs due to the over-stretching of the skin, beyond its elasticity.
• This typically occurs in the setting of a fractured femur, where the fracture fragment may stretch and pierce the skin to project out
• Avulsed laceration
• An avulsion is a lesion where the skin only separates by tearing from the underlying tissues or peels off and overhangs the wound
• This is common in road traffic accidents.",2701-1645.PNG,C,
Q10,You are posted as an intern in casualty when an MLC case is brought by the police with the following appearance. she was declared brought dead. what would you mark as the likely    cause of death before sending the patient for postmortem?,"a)Drowning
b)Hanging
c)strangulation
d)Traumatic asphyxia","The given image shows frothing from nostrils and no clear signs of facial or conjunctival congestion. It is likely a case of drowning.
Frothing may also be seen in throttling or strangulation, but it might be associated with signs of conjunctival congestion, facial congestion, patterned bruise on neck etc. In the absence of these  features, it is unlikely to be caused by strangulation.
Traumatic asphyxia is unlikely as the face of this patient is all whitened without signs of congestion or any obvious signs of trauma",2702-1647.PNG,A,
Q11,what is the approximate age of a person in whom the medial end of the clavicle is fused and also the sternum is completely fused,"a)&lt;18 years
b)18-22 years
c)22-25 years
d)&gt;25 years","Approximate age for the given person with fused medial end of clavicle and completely fused sternum is most likely &gt;25 years.
The sternum is formed from the fusion of Manubrium, 4 sternebrae(body), and the xiphoid
process. The fusion of sternebrae occurs from below upwards, followed by its fusion to the xiphoid process and then fusion of manubrium to the fused sternum.

Q12,Identify the condition shown in the image.,"a)postmortem lividity
b)Marbling
c)Filigree burns
d)subcutaneous emphysema","The image shows postmortem marbling. It is a visible postmortem change that is characterized by linear branching patterns on skin that correspond to the course of superficial veins.
Intestinal bacteria infest the venous system as blood acts as a nutrient medium for their
proliferation. There is subsequent hemolysis which stains the vessel walls and the adjacent
tissues, giving rise to marbling. This becomes prominent in about 36–48 hours after death in the summer and is distinctly appreciable in the superficial veins of the abdomen, shoulders, chest,
and inguinal region.",2703-1648.PNG,B,
Q13,Identify the image shown below,"a)shot gun wound

Q14,"A 22-year-old woman was found dead at home. she was brought to the mortuary by the police and the following findings were noted on examination. which of the following is the likely
cause of her death?","a)strangulation by ligature
b)Hanging
c)Throttling
d)Drowning","In the given case scenario and autopsy images showing carotid intimal tear and muscle hematoma with nail marks on neck and absence of ligature mark point towards a diagnosis of throttling.
other options
option A- strangulation by ligature - ligature mark with signs of a struggle would've made this diagnosis more likely.
option B- Hanging - ligature mark with a suicide note would've made it more likely.
option C- Drowning- Body recovered from a pond or other water body with other suggestive features like frothing etc  would've made this more likely.",2704-1649.PNG,C,
Q15,which of the following is seen in freshwater drowning?,"a)A,B,C,D
b)A,B,C
c)B,C,D
d)A,C,D","In cases of freshwater drowning, hyperkalemia is seen due to hemolysis of swollen RBCs and not hypokalemia.
Freshwater is hypotonic to plasma and is rapidly absorbed from the alveoli and into the RBCs. The RBCs finally swell up and lyse resulting in the release of intracellular potassium causing     hyperkalemia. Increased intravascular blood volume combined with hyperkalemia causes
arrhythmia.
seawater is hypertonic to plasma and causing a shift of fluid from the blood to alveoli causing
pulmonary edema. There is a net decrease in blood volume causing a fall in blood pressure. The table below summarises the cause of death in different types of drowning.

c)A-1, B-2, C-4, D-3
d)A-4, B-1, C-3, D-2","The correctly matched sets of the above-mentioned weapons and the possible injuries are as follows:
Mechanism of injury with the above mentioned weapons:
Axe - it is a heavy weapon that may or may not be sharpened. Injury is produced by chopping   action of the weapon and it may be in a spectrum of an incised wound to laceration depending upon the sharpness of the blade.
Road traffic accident - rubbing of epidermis tangential to a rough or hard surface gives rise to
graze abrasion also called brush burn. It can occur in a road traffic accident after a pedestrian is being hit by a vehicle and the victim is slid/grazed for some distance before he comes to a halt.
Blade - it gives rise to a clean-cut wound which is usually deepest at its starting. Tailing of the  wound indicates the direction of injury. Length is the biggest parameter of this type of wound.
Lathi- It is a blunt force injury giving rise to a patterned abrasion with 2 parallel lines and a
normal unbruised area on site of impact or stick/lathi. The lathi forces the blood from the site of impact to either side which gives rise to tramline appearance.

Rationale for the classification
zinc chloride also known as butter of zinc is highly irritant to the eyes on topical application. It
can cause erosive esophagitis on ingestion. It has a fatal dose of 350mg. It could've also been
classified as a corrosive, but since potassium carbonate is an alkali with stronger corrosive action, it is better classified as an irritant for this question
chloral hydrate is a cNS depressant. It is also known as knockout drops because of its rapid action and used in robbery or rape to quickly render the victim helpless.



Quinine is a cardiotoxic drug with the additional action of being an abortifacient. It's overdose may lead to an echolic action (contract the pregnant uterus)
potassium carbonate is a caustic alkali with a predominant action of corrosive due to its high pH.
