Q1,Identify the following image.,"a)Blister due to barbiturate poisoning
b)Blister due to antemortem burns
c)Edema due to chemical burn
d)pemphigus vulgaris","The given image of burns with blisters with surrounding hyperemia points to a diagnosis of antemortem burns.
A Zone of hyperemia (line of redness), which varies in width is present at the edge of the burnt    area in antemortem burns.  It is due to edema of tissues and capillary dilatation which merges    with the edge of the burn. It involves the whole thickness of the actual skin. It is permanent and persists even after death. If the entire body is burnt, a line of redness will be absent.
The antemortem blister appears as a raised dome. It contains serous fluid with proteins and
chlorides. The base shows reddening with swollen papillae. In antemortem burns, the skin
adjacent to the burnt area shows an increase in enZyme reaction. The reaction is increased for
sulfhydryl groups in all layers. There is also an increase in ATP, esterases, aminopeptidases, and acid and alkaline phosphatase. Marked cellular exudation and reactive tissue changes are called  vital reactions. This is characteristic of antemortem burns.
other options-
option A: Blister due to barbiturate poisoning, is commonly seen in frictional areas such as interdigital cleft, genital regions, etc. It is due to the dermo necrotic effect of barbiturates.
option C: Chemical burns by acid or alkalis appear as ulcerated patches without blisters. The hair is not singed and the red line of demarcation is absent. sometimes, the burn shows distinct



coloration and is usually uniform in character. strong acids produce dark leathery burns on the skin. strong alkalis cause the skin to slough and leave moist, slimy, greyish areas.
option D: pemphigus vulgaris is an intraepidermal immunobullous disease. It occurs commonly between the 4th to 6th decades. They present with flaccid blisters. Mucosal involvement will be   seen in the form of buccal and palatal erosions. Firm pressure over the lesion separates the
epidermis from the dermis. Nikolsky's sign is positive.",2843-1718.PNG,B,2850-1719.PNG
Q2,"A 5-year-old boy went to the temple in a village with his grandmother. He was crying
inconsolably on the way back. He was taken to the emergency department within 3 hours. He had altered sensorium, cold clammy extremities, increased salivation, and excessive sweating. on examination, he was pale and had priapism with the following vitals - Bp - 14o/78 mmHg, HR - 152/min, RR - 36/min spo2 of 96%. which of the following would you use in his
management?","a)Anti-snake venom
b)Methylprednisolone
c)prazosin
d)Adrenaline","The clinical stem points to a likely diagnosis of a scorpion bite, for which prazosin can be used in  the management. It acts as a physiological antidote counteracting the symptoms of the adrenergic surge.
The venom is a potent autonomic stimulator that causes the release of massive amounts of catecholamines from the adrenals. It also has a direct effect on the myocardium.
scorpion sting usually presents with localized redness and burning pain which is unable to
localize due to its radiation along the dermatomes involved, localized swelling, and punctate
hemorrhagic spots. other features include headache, profuse perspiration, chest discomfort,
paraesthesias, hypersalivation, cold extremities, and sometimes, priapism. Hypertension usually develops early, while pulmonary edema and myocarditis may develop later.
Treatment:
• paracetamol, NsAIDs, or opioids for pain.
• Benzodiazepines for sedation for agitation, oculomotor abnormalities, uncoordinated neuromuscular activity, and muscle spasms.
• Hypertension and pulmonary edema- prazosin counteracts the adrenergic surge that can lead to these effects.
• cardiogenic shock- Antivenom, prazosin, nitroglycerin, dobutamine.



• cholinergic effects- Atropine.
• supportive care, wound care.",,C,
Q3,"In an examination for drunkenness, a person smells of alcohol and his conjunctiva appears   red. During the examination of motor coordination, it is noted that he can walk in a straight line and can talk normally. which of the following statements is true?","a)He has consumed alcohol
b)He has consumed alcohol and is under the influence of alcohol
c)He has consumed alcohol but is not under its influence
d)He has not consumed alcohol","The given scenario of a person who smells of alcohol but whose motor coordination is normal with no slurring of speech is suggestive that he has consumed alcohol but is not under its influence.

Q4,The Blackfoot disease is an endemic peripheral vascular disease seen in toxicity of which of the following metal?,"a)Arsenic
b)Antimony
c)Barium
d)cadmium","The Blackfoot disease is due to chronic arsenic poisoning.
In china (province of Taiwan) exposure to arsenic via drinking water has been shown to cause a severe disease of the blood vessels, which leads to gangrene, known as 'black foot disease'. The    Blackfoot disease is due to platelet activation &amp; hypercoagulability of blood in peripheral



arteries and is observed in endemic areas of arsenicism.
clinicopathological findings in acute and chronic arsenic poisoning:
option B: The symptoms of antimony poisoning, both acute and chronic are similar to that of
arsenic. Inhalation of fumes causes a flu-like illness called metal fume fever. In cases of chronic    poisoning with heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, mercury, antimony, copper, etc., the shaft of a long bone, strands of scalp hair, fingernails or toenails, and a wedge of the quadriceps muscle
should be taken for sampling.
option c: Barium poisoning causes nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It causes cramps and stiffness of the muscles, dilation of the pupil, paralysis of the tongue and larynx, and vertigo. There is
increased blood pressure with slow and irregular pulse.
option D: cadmium poisoning causes proteinuria and painful bone lesions known as ouch-ouch disease.

Q5,"A 12-year-old girl is brought by a lady police sub-inspector with an alleged history of sexual violence 2 days back. she was accompanied by her mother. The registered medical
practitioner should do which of the following as the next step?","a)Take a detailed history
b)preserve clothing
c)Take consent for genital examination
d)Documentation of injuries and examination findings","The registered medical practitioner should take a detailed history as the next step.
The registered medical practitioner must take a detailed history and then take informed consent for examination. In case of refusal, an informed refusal is to be documented after explaining to   them the consequences of choice. As part of the examination, they should collect
specimens, preserve clothing, and document injuries and examination findings. Medical
treatment and testing for pregnancy have to be done for all victims of sexual assault free of cost and police should be informed as per section 357-c of crpc.
The protection of children from sexual offences (pocso) Act, 2012 considers all individuals
(both male and female) below the age of 18 years as children and protects them from sexual abuse. It defines various forms of sexual offenses which include:
• sexual harassment: A person is said to commit sexual harassment upon a child when such person with sexual intent,
• carries out any act with sexual connotations
• makes a child exhibit his/her body
• shows any object to a child in any form/media for pornographic purposes.
• sexual assault
• Any act with sexual intent that involves physical contact without penetration.
• Aggravated sexual assault
• similar to sexual assault along with the criteria explained under the term ""aggravated"".
• penetrative sexual assault
• An act with sexual intent that involves physical penetration.
• Aggravated penetrative sexual assault
• similar to penetrative sexual assault along with the criteria explained under the term ""aggravated"".
• pornography
The term aggravated is used for those assaults done:
• by a person in a position of trust or authority such as police officer, security forces, relative, doctor.
• in the course of communal violence.
• on mentally &amp; physically disabled.
• gang sexual assault.
• using deadly weapons.
• causing grievous hurt
The Act prescribes stringent punishment graded as per the gravity of the offense, with a maximum term of rigorous imprisonment for life and fine. section 21(1) of the pocso Act, 2012 requires
mandatory reporting of cases of child sexual abuse to law enforcement authorities and applies to



everyone including parents, doctors, and school personnel. Failure to report a suspicion of child abuse is an offense under the Act.",,A,
Q6,which of the following is not true about postmortem changes?,"a)In drowning, postmortem hypostasis is seen only in the lower limbs
b)Greenish discolouration in right iliac fossa is the earliest sign of decomposition
c)Adipocere is seen in bodies recovered from water source
d)cadaveric spasm is seen only in specific group of muscles","In the case of drowning, if the water is still, the postmortem hypostasis affects the head, chest and the limbs. This is because the chest and abdomen float higher because of the lungs and the
abdominal gases. Drowning in fast-flowing water results in absent postmortem staining as the position of the body keeps on changing.
postmortem hypostasis/postmortem staining/postmortem lividity/Livor mortis/suggilation refers to bluish-purple or reddish-purple discoloration of the superficial layers of the dermis. It is
an early postmortem change that occurs due to the stagnation of blood in the vessels of
the dependent parts due to the effect of gravity.
sites of postmortem hypostasis depending on the position of the body:
postmortem changes are classified on the basis of time:
• Immediate signs of death (at the time of somatic or clinical death):
• Insensibility and loss of voluntary power
• cessation of respiration
• cessation of circulation
• Early signs of death. It is seen in cellular death:
• pallor and loss of elasticity of the skin
• Eye changes
• primary flaccidity of muscles
• Algor mortis/postmortem cooling
• postmortem lividity/suggillation
• Rigor mortis
• Late signs of death:
• putrefaction
• Adipocere
• Mummification
other options-
option B: The first external sign of putrefaction in a body lying outside in the air is a greenish
discoloration of the skin over the region of the right iliac fossa. sulphmethemoglobin is the agent imparting greenish color.
option c: Adipocere is a modification of putrefaction. The transformation is brought about by  the gradual hydrolysis and hydrogenation of pre-existing fats, including olein, into higher fatty acids. It is characterized by the formation of a waxy, soft, moist, and whitish substance with a



sweetish offensive or ammoniacal (early stages) odor. It is more commonly seen in bodies recovered from damp, warm environments or immersed in water.
option D: cadaveric spasm - This is a vital sign of antemortem drowning. cadaveric spasm is
limited to select muscles i.e., the muscles that were in a state of contraction at the time of death.   The mechanism of cadaveric spasm is thought to be due to neurogenic phenomena. Gravel, weed, soil, grass, etc. is firmly held in the clenched hands due to cadaveric spasm. The material also
indicates the place of submersion.

Q7,A female was brought for autopsy with an alleged history of being found at a lake in the village. All of the following are suggestive of antemortem drowning except:,"a)water in stomach
b)washerwoman's hands and feet
c)white leathery foam around mouth and nostrils
d)positive diatom test","washerwoman's hands and feet are a non-specific sign of submersion. They occur due to the imbibition of water into the outer skin layers. They can be seen in antemortem as well as
postmortem drowning victims.
The presence of water in the stomach, white leathery foam around the mouth and nostrils, and a positive diatom test are suggestive of antemortem drowning.
Given below are the features of antemortem drowning.
• Froth - The presence of copious amounts of fine, shaving-lather-like froth at the mouth and the nostrils is the most characteristic finding of antemortem drowning. It is caused by the vigorous    agitation of the tracheal and bronchial mucous secretions, edema fluid, and alveolar surfactant    during respiratory efforts.
• cutis anserina - The contraction of the erector pilorum muscles causes puckering and grainy appearance of the skin. This resembles goose skin; hence, it is called cutis anserina.
• washerwoman’s hand - Maceration of the skin on the palms and soles gives a wrinkled, sodden, and bleached appearance due to submersion.
• cadaveric spasm - Gravel, weed, soil, grass, etc. is firmly held in the clenched hands due to   cadaveric spasm. This is a vital sign of antemortem drowning. The material also indicates the place of submersion.
• Rigor mortis - This appears early in cases of a violent antemortem struggle.
• Face - It is bloated and discolored, with cyanosis.



• Eyes - conjunctiva are suffused and pupils dilated.
• Tongue - It may be swollen and protruded.
• Antemortem injuries - These may be sustained by striking objects, such as rocks, during the fall into the water body. Examination for such injuries must be performed only after the body is dry.
Internal findings:
• Lungs - They appear voluminous and distended and show ballooning. The cut section will exude copious amounts of frothy, bloodstained fluid.
• Larynx, trachea, and bronchioles - The presence of sand, silt, and aquatic vegetation in the trachea and lower respiratory tract are characteristic findings of antemortem drowning.
• Heart and blood vessels- Gettler test can be done to estimate the chloride content in the right and left sides of the heart to differentiate between freshwater and saltwater drowning.
• Diatom test- Diatoms are microscopic algae. Their presence in the organs, particularly in the bone marrow, is suggestive of antemortem drowning.
• stomach and small intestines- These organs may contain water in some cases. water present in the small intestine is positive evidence of death by drowning.
• Middle ear - The presence of water in the middle ear is highly suggestive of antemortem drowning.
• Brain - It is congested, and edematous, with loss of gray-white junction.",,B,
Q8,"In death due to firearm injury, the entry wound shows only an abrasion collar. The range of the firearm is:","a)contact range
b)close range
c)Near range
d)Distant range","The entry wound shows only an abrasion collar when the range of the firearm is distant.
To determine the range of firing, the following parameters are used:
• The entry wound size and shape
• Blast effect – Muzzle end imprint and edge eversion
• Blackening, Tattooing, singeing of hair, Abrasion collar, and Grease collar
• Hair should be preserved to determine the range of firing which can be examined for
carbonization/desiccation in close range, also from lead deposition around the wound to assess the range of firing.
Abrasion collar: Gyroscopic movement of the bullet, the skin's elasticity, and the grease and dirt    particles on the bullet's surface are the major causative factors of abrasion and grease collar. They are seen on the skin around the wound of entry at all ranges. Depending on the angle of entry
made by the bullet, i.e.
• A perpendicular entry of the bullet develops the abrasion collar of rounded shape.
• An acute angular entry of the bullet develops the abrasion collar of an oblique or oval shape.
• some contusion present in the abraded collar is known as contusion collar

Q9,"In the 18th century, the British East India company smuggled which of the following drugs to china?","a)cocaine
b)Magic mushroom
c)opium
d)Marijuana","The British East India company smuggled opium into china in exchange for tea, silk and porcelain pots.
opium derived from the immature seedpods ofthe opium poppy (papaver somniferum), was
originally indigenous to the present-day territory of Turkey. The introduction of opium to china occurred during the late 6th or early 7th century cE, facilitated by Turkish and Arab traders.
During this time, tobacco smoking moved from North America to china, resulting in widespread opium smoking. opium addiction and imports increased in the first century of the Qing era
(1644–1911/12). To address the issue, the yongzheng emperor (1722–35) banned opium trafficking and consumption in 1729. Despite hurdles, the trade continued, and in 1796, the Jiaqing emperor banned opium imports and cultivation. opium sales survived despite these laws.
In the early 18th century, the portuguese made a lot of money importing opium from India and  selling it in china. British traders became china's main suppliers in 1773. The British East India company monopolized Bengali opium farming. The company developed an inexpensive and
productive opium poppies cultivation method in this location. The Us and other western nations traded Turkish and Indian opium.
The opium trade was pursued by Britain and other European nations as a means to address their  persistent trade deficit with china. In Europe, there existed a substantial and notable demand for chinese commodities such as tea, silks, and porcelain pots. conversely, in china, there was a very limited market for Europe's manufactured goods and other trade items. As a result, Europeans
were required to utilize gold or silver as payment for chinese goods. The opium trade, which
resulted in a consistent demand for opium among chinese individuals addicted to the substance,  effectively addressed the persistent trade imbalance by facilitating the importation of opium from western countries.
opium was not carried by the East India company. Due to the chinese restriction, the
corporation outsourced it to “country traders”—private traders entitled to transport commodities from India to china. smugglers on the chinese shore bought opium from country traders. The
traders gave the East India company their sales of gold and silver. The corporation spent its gold and silver in china on profitable things to sell in England.
opium imports into china rose from 2oo chests in 1729 to 1,ooo in 1767 and 1o,ooo between
182o and 183o. Although chest weight varied by origin, it averaged 14o pounds (63.5 kg). By 1838, china imported 4o,ooo chests annually. china lost the balance of payments to Britain for the first time. opium distribution networks had evolved across china, frequently with corrupt officials'
help. High opium addiction levels affected imperial troops and officials.",,C,
Q10,"An industrial worker sustained burn injuries to the anterior region of his chest and abdomen, as well as burns to his right upper limb and a circumferential burn to his right thigh, as a
result of a cylinder explosion. what is the percentage of total burns surface area?","a)27
b)36
c)45
d)53","The affected percentage of body surface area (BsA) is calculated using wallace's rule of 9:
• Right upper limb - 9%
• circumferential right thigh - 9% (Anterior thigh 4.5% and posterior thigh 4.5% in Adults)



• Anterior chest - 9%
• Anterior abdomen - 9% Thus, totaling to 36%.
Note: According to Bailey's short practice of surgery, 28th edition, the anterior thigh accounts for 4%, while according to current practice of surgery, 14th edition, the anterior thigh accounts for     4.75 %. Either percentage, when totalled gives us the best possible answer to this question to be     36%.
The following image shows wallace's rule of 9:


Lund and Browder's chart is an accurate method to measure burns if it is used correctly. In this, different proportions of body surface areas in children are taken into consideration. This chart

Q11,"In a Firearm injury, blackening surrounding the gunshot entry wound is due to?","a)Flame effect
b)unburnt powder
c)smoke deposition
d)Muzzle of the firearm","Blackening occurs due to the deposits of smoke over the epidermis which can be removed with a wet cloth. This can be seen up to around 15 cm of firing.
other injuries related to firearms are:
• Burn injuries - occur due to flame released during the firing. It is seen in contact shot wounds or distances up to 5-8 cm. singeing of hair is caused due to burns.
• Tattooing - occurs due to the deposition of unburnt powder particles. These are difficult to remove. They are also called stippling or peppering. This is seen up to 5o cm of firing
• Greasing and collaring - occur due to the deposition of the lubricant of the bullet in the tissues, during its penetration. It can be found in contact, near-shot, or distant shot wounds.
In a firm contact shot, the imprint of the muzzle of the gun is seen on the skin around the wound. The victim is within the range of flame, hence singeing of the hair will be present. Tattooing
begins only when the muzzle-to-target distance is &gt;1cm, like in a loose contact shot.
when the distance between the victim and the firing is 5-8cm, it is called a close shot. The victim is within the range of the flame, hence, features related to flame, smoke, and powder deposition   will be seen. singeing, burning, blackening and tattooing will be present.
when the distance between the victim and the firing is &gt;5o cm, it is a distant shot. The victim lies outside the range of flame and powder deposition. Hence, features related to flame, smoke,   and powder deposition are absent. Burning, blackening, and tattooing are absent.",,C,

Nicotine is the principal constituent of tobacco responsible for its addictive behaviour. one of the newest agents introduced to aid in smoking cessation is varenicline.
Adverse effects of nicotine intoxication:
• Doses of 6o mg are toxic to the person and can cause respiratory paralysis.
• Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea
• salivation
• Increased blood pressure, tachycardia, tremors and cardiac arrhythmias. other cardiac poisons include oleander and Digitalis.
strychnine poisoning occurs if a person ingests crushed seeds of strychnos nux vomica. If
swallowed uncrushed, the seeds of nux vomica have no poisonous action. The fatal dose is 15-3o mg of strychnine or one crushed seed.
strychnine is a competitive antagonist of glycine at the postganglionic receptors in the motor
neurons of the anterior horn of the spinal cord. This leads to increased activity in the motor
neurons. patients typically present with risus sardonicus, convulsions that are clonic initially but eventually become tonic and are most marked in anti-gravity muscles so that the body typically   arches in hyperextension, the posture known as opisthotonus. If the spasm involves the
abdominal muscles, the body bends forward (emprosthotonos), or to the side (pleurosthotonus)





Nitric acid is a corrosive inorganic acid. Due to the xanthoproteic reaction, the nitric acid
combines with aromatic amino acids like tyrosine to form picric acid which is responsible for the yellowish discolouration of the skin.",,A,2861-1723.PNG;2862-1724.PNG;2863-1726.PNG;2863-1725.PNG

Q15,A 25 year old man was brought to the casualty in a semiconscious state following a road traffic accident. which type of injury is unlikely to be seen in this patient?,"a)Graze abrasions
b)Laceration wound
c)Multiple contusions
d)chop wound","A chop wound would be unlikely to be found in this patient who has succumbed to a road traffic accident.
Injuries that are common following a blunt impact (here road and traffic accident) include:
• Bruises and contusions
• Laceration
• Abrasion (patterned due to tyre marks)
chop wounds or slash wounds are the wounds produced by chopping motion, made with heavy
and sharp weapons like axes, cleave, etc. The dimensions of the wound correspond to the
crosssection of the penetrating part of the weapon. The margins are sharp and show slight
abrasion and bruising with the destruction of underlying organs. The presence of an incised
wound on the skin with an underlying fracture or deep grove in the bone indicates a chop wound. The majority of these injuries are homicidal in nature and are typically inflicted upon the
vulnerable regions of the body, such as the head, face, neck, shoulders, and extremities.
Accidental injuries can be attributed to various sources such as power fans, band saws, or ship   and aeroplane propellers. These incidents have the potential to cause significant lacerations to   soft tissues or result in the amputation of body parts. Instances of self-inflicted lacerations with suicidal intent have seldom been observed.





Individuals who sustain injuries as a result of road accidents can be categorized into three
categories: pedestrians, cyclists (both pedal-powered and motorized), and occupants of cars,
including both drivers and passengers. Among these three categories, pedestrians are frequently    the ones who sustain injuries, however, the percentage of pedestrian casualties exhibits significant variation depending on the traffic patterns observed in different nations.
Injuries to pedestrians:
• primary impact injuries are caused by the first impact of the vehicle on the victim.
• secondary impact injuries are further injuries caused by the vehicle.
• Tertiary injuries are caused when the victim strikes other objects or falls on the ground after being hit by the vehicle.
Note: In case a pedestrian is hit by the vehicle only once (i.e only primary impact and no
secondary impact by the vehicle) and then sustains injuries by falling on the road, it would be an example of secondary injury.




Injuries to occupants:
Approximately eighty per cent of vehicle impacts are against another vehicle or a stationary object and involve the front or front corners. vehicle deceleration is rapid in this impact. Rarely, the car  is hit from behind, causing ‘acceleration’. The least common impacts are side and 'roll-overs'.
In a typical unrestrained deceleration condition, front-seat occupants surge forward and hit car structures in front of them.
An unrestrained impact may cause the following:
• The face and head following a collision with the windscreen glass, frame, or side pillars, cause skull and cervical spine fractures along with brain injury.
• contact with the fascia or steering wheel can cause rib, sternal, heart, and liver damage.
• Hyperflexion may cause aorta tears at the descending part of the arch, where the vessel attaches to the vertebral column.
• The passenger's knees may hit the parcel shelf, causing fractures.
• The driver's legs, supported by stop and clutch pedals, may transfer impact force to the pelvis via the tibia and femur.
• The rebounding force from the contact may cause the head to violently swing backwards, damaging the cervical or thoracic spine.
unrestrained rear occupants are projected forwards and impact the back of the front seats,
including headrests if equipped, during severe deceleration. They may be hurled over the seats, striking and injuring the front-seat occupants, or they may be expelled through the windscreen, which has been damaged by them or the persons in front.
Injuries inflicted on motorcyclists following collision with other vehicles include patterned
abrasions and various head, chest and spine injuries. A distinct injury can arise from the practice of ""tail-gating"" in which a motorcycle manoeuvres beneath the rear of a vehicle, resulting in
significant cranial trauma or, in extreme cases, decapitation. The implementation of protective     bars positioned at the sides and rear of trucks has effectively mitigated the occurrence of injuries resulting from bikes and vehicles passing beneath the vehicle.",,D,2714-1653.PNG;2866-1727.PNG
Q16,"An autopsy was performed on a person with a history of drowning; however, the report
revealed that there was no water in his lungs, hence the case was labeled as dry drowning. what is the most likely cause of his death?","a)vagal inhibition
b)Laryngospasm
c)pulmonary edema
d)Electrolyte imbalace","In dry drowning death is due to sustained laryngeal spasm and subsequent airway closure. This occurs when there is sudden entry of water into the nasopharynx or larynx.
Dry drowning:
In this type of drowning, water does not enter the lungs, but death results from immediate
sustained laryngeal spasm due to an inrush of water into the nasopharyngeal or larynx. Thick mucus, foam and froth may develop, producing a plug.
Immersion syndrome (Hydrocution/submersion inhibition):
Death results from cardiac arrest due to vagal inhibition as a result of
• cold water stimulates the nerve endings of the surface of the body.



• water striking the epigastrium.
• cold water enters ear drums, nasal passages, pharynx and the larynx which cause stimulation of the nerve endings ofthe mucosa.
secondary drowning/post immersion-syndrome/Near drowning:
It refers to a submersion victim who is resuscitated and survives for 24 hours. The patient may or may not be conscious. These patients may develop hypoxemia resulting in brain damage,
electrolyte disturbances, pulmonary edema, sepsis, myocardial anoxia, etc., Death may occur from half to several hours after resuscitation in about 1o-2o% of people. Those who survive suffer from  serious neurological damage.

Q17,cadaveric spasm is not seen in?,"a)Drowning
b)Traumatic asphyxia
c)Firearm suicidal wounds
d)Electrocution","cadaveric spasm cannot be observed in traumatic asphyxia as the occurrence of traumatic
asphyxia is sudden and hence does not give the patient or victim time to contract his muscles during the time of death.
cadaveric spasm has been observed in the following situations:
• Drowning death
• Brain Injury
• Fear or Excitement
• Electrocution
perte's syndrome, also known as traumatic asphyxia, is a clinical syndrome characterized by
craniocervical cyanosis, subconjunctival haemorrhage, numerous petechiae, and accompanying
neurological symptoms. This syndrome manifests due to the abrupt or intense compression of the thorax or upper abdomen, or both. Frequently observed injuries encompass pulmonary contusion, hemothorax, and pneumothorax. Effective management of the related injuries is crucial for
optimal treatment outcomes. The expeditious initiation of treatment with a focus on restoring
adequate oxygenation and perfusion has the potential to yield a favourable prognosis. The
recoveries of the patients were shown to be correlated with the severity of their injuries as well as the presence of concomitant injuries.



cadaveric spasm is an antemortem change that indicates the cause and manner of death. This phenomenon is alternatively referred to as instantaneous rigor or cataleptic rigidity
The victims do not undergo postmortem flaccidity (unlike rigor mortis), thereby directly entering a state of instantaneous rigor. This results in muscle stiffening which indicates the victim's
attitude at the time of death. cadaveric spasm is limited to select muscles i.e., the muscles that     were in a state of contraction at the time of death. The mechanism of cadaveric spasm is thought to be due to neurogenic phenomena.
predisposing factors for this postmortem change include excitement, fear, fatigue, electrocution, nervous system injury, and convulsant poisons such as strychnine. It is a unique phenomenon
that cannot be replicated by any other situation, and it is not possible to induce it through any
means following the cessation of life. A significant amount of force is necessary to overcome
stiffness. The phenomenon seamlessly transitions into typical rigor mortis and ceases to exist after rigor mortis subsides.The process of protein coagulation can be observed under microscopic
analysis in burns, but not in cases of cadaveric spasm.",,B,
Q18,which of the following is not considered a grievous hurt?,"a)unilateral permanent hearing loss
b)Emasculation
c)Fracture of limb
d)7 days admission in yellow zone of hospital","Among the options provided, a seven-day admission in the yellow zone of the hospital is not an   example of grievous hurt, but any hurt which causes the sufferer to be in severe body pain for 15 days is considered to be an example of grievous hurt.
Grievous hurt (Sec 116 BNS) is inflicted voluntarily on another person and comprises any of the eight kinds (clauses) enumerated below:
clause 1 — Emasculation.
clause 2 — permanent privation of the sight of either eye.
clause 3 — permanent privation of the hearing of either ear.
clause 4 — privation of any member or joint.
clause 5 — Destruction or permanent impairment of powers of any member or joint.
clause 6 — permanent disfigurement of head or face.
clause 7 — Fracture or dislocation of bone or tooth.
clause 8 — Any hurt that endangers life or causes the sufferer to be in severe bodily pain or unable to follow his or her ordinary pursuits for 15 days.

Q19,"All of the following can be used for the identification of a dead body, except?","a)Blood
b)Nail
c)Muscle
d)Teeth","Among the options, nail is the least preferred in the identification of a dead body.
Nails have been used in the identification of dead bodies, however, their use has been deemed
uncommon. Skeletal muscles are resistant to degradation and are therefore more likely to persist during decomposition, thus making them useful for the identification of corpses. It is also
important to note that few studies show the amount of identical loci decreases with time.
Suitable samples for DNA analysis encompass several types of nucleated biological material,
including but not limited to white blood cells, hair root bulb cells, and spermatozoa. In the past, a substantial quantity of samples was necessary for doing this analysis. However, the advent of the   polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a technique capable of amplifying minute quantities of DNA,
has enabled the identification of DNA from even the most limited samples.
when obtaining samples, whether from a deceased individual, a living victim, or the accused, the size of the sample that can be collected is typically not a significant concern. The collection of
samples from various locations of staining inside the scene, the deceased, the surviving victim, or the accused can provide distinct challenges. These areas may consist of minute traces of blood,
semen staining, and similar substances, necessitating meticulous collection procedures to mitigate the risk of contamination.
Blood and hair with intact follicles are utilized in both live and deceased individuals, while
samples ofthe spleen can be obtained during post-mortem examinations. Additionally, buccal
smears can be collected from living individuals. In situations where sexual assault is a potential
occurrence, or in instances of suspicious deaths, it is advisable to collect vaginal, anal, and penile swabs. In the event of a potential delay in transporting samples to the laboratory, it is
recommended that the samples be subjected to freezing conditions at a temperature of -2o°C or as specifically directed by the laboratory.",,B,
Q20,which chelating agent is not used in heavy metal poisoning?,"a)British anti-Lewisite
b)Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
c)pralidoxime
d)penicillamine","Pralidoxime is used in organophosphate poisoning and not as a chelator in heavy metal poisoning.
In organophosphate poisoning, oximes like pralidoxime (2-PAM) regenerates active
acetylcholinesterase restoring neuromuscular transmission and relieves skeletal muscle end-plate block. It is usually used as an adjuvant to atropine which act as competitive inhibitors to counter  the nicotinic and muscarinic effects of organophosphates.
Pralidoxime should not be administered without concurrent atropine, in order to prevent worsening of symptoms due to transient oxime-induced acetylcholinesterase inhibition.



pralidoxime attaches to the anionic site of the cholinesterase enzyme, which remains unoccupied   in the presence of organophosphates. It binds and forms oxime-phosphonate which diffuses away, leaving the reactivated cholinesterase. pralidoxime is not an effective antidote to carbamates like    carbaryl and may potentiate its toxicity, as the anionic site required for attachment of oximes
is occupied.
other options :
option A : British anti-Lewisite (BAL) also known as Dimercaprol is used as an antidote for
gold, arsenic (except arsine), or acute mercury poisoning (except non-alkyl mercury). It is also an adjunct to edetate calcium disodium in acute lead poisoning.
option B : Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is used for acute lead poisoning. It is not
suitable for the management of chronic lead poisoning. The calcium salt of EDTA can be used in the management of heavy metal poisonings where the metal in question has a higher affinity for  EDTA than calcium in vivo. Because of their lower affinity to EDTA, mercury and arsenic cannot be effectively chelated.
option D : penicillamine is used as a chelator in the treatment of mild cases of lead
poisoning. D-penicillamine (cuprimine) can also be used to treat scleroderma, wilson's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. side effects include nephrotoxicity, hematologic derangements, and a characteristic rash that involves the neck and axillae—elastosis perforans serpiginosa. It is
associated with membranous glomerulonephritis, drug-induced lupus, and myasthenia gravis.",,C,
