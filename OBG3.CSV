Q1,A 4o-year-old woman comes with a history of postcoital bleeding and a visible mass seen in the cervix per speculum. The next step to be done:,"a)conization
b)cryotherapy
c)Targeted biopsy
d)Pap smear","A targeted biopsy is the next line of management in the patient with a visible cervical mass and postcoital bleeding. A pap smear is done when there are symptoms with no identifiable lesion.
other options:
option A: conization is an invasive procedure where the cervix is cut in a cone-shaped manner. It is both diagnostic and therapeutic. It is indicated for diagnosis in women with HSIL or
adenocarcinoma in situ and may be considered under the following conditions:
• The limits of the lesion cannot be visualized with colposcopy.
• ScJ (squamocolumnar junction) is not seen in colposcopy.
• colposcopy is positive for cIN 2/cIN 3.
• Lack of correlation between cytology, biopsy, and colposcopy.
• Suspected micro invasion in cytology, colposcopy, or biopsy.
• colposcopist is unable to rule out invasive cancer.
Hence it is very clear that conization is not indicated for all symptomatic women and it should be done following either a PAP, colposcopy or a biopsy with an abnormal or inconclusive result.
option B: cryotherapy is ideal only for small superficial lesions. It is indicated for biopsy-proven   lesions. cryotherapy is appropriate for cIN 1 which has persisted for more than 24 months and is confined to the ectocervix.
option D: The false negative rate of pap smear in the presence of invasive cancer is 5o% and a
negative pap test should never be relied on in a symptomatic patient, especially one with a visible lesion.
cIN: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, HSIL: High squamous intraepithelial lesion, LSIL: Low squamous intraepithelial lesion",,C,
Q2,"In preterm labor, which drug has a neuroprotective role?","a)Mgso4
b)Nifedipine
c)Ritodrine
d)Isoxsuprine","In preterm labor, MgSo4 (magnesium sulfate) is considered to have a neuroprotective     role. Studies have demonstrated that magnesium exposure (compared with no exposure)
significantly lowers the risks for cerebral palsy.
The combination of corticosteroids and magnesium sulfate has been associated with lower rates of neurodevelopmental impairment and death compared to corticosteroids alone.
The proposed mechanisms of action include:
• reduced presynaptic release of glutamate
• blockade of glutamatergic NMDA receptors
• potentiation of adenosine action
• improved calcium buffering by mitochondria
• blockage of calcium entry via voltage-gated channels



Mgso4 is used as an anticonvulsant in the management of eclampsia and as prophylaxis in severe preeclampsia. The therapeutic level of magnesium in eclampsia is 4–7 mEq/L. Measurement of
serum magnesium levels is indicated to monitor magnesium toxicity (if serum creatinine &gt; 1.o mg/dL).
Loss of patellar reflex is the first sign of Mgso4 toxicity and occurs when the plasma magnesium level reaches 1o mEq/L. Elevated magnesium levels above 1o mEq/L weaken breathing, while 12   mEq/L or higher levels can lead to respiratory paralysis and arrest. other signs of magnesium
toxicity include urine output &lt;3o mL/h, chest pain, and heart block visual changes, flushing, muscle paralysis, and drowsiness.
In suspected toxicity, Mgso4 therapy should be stopped and a slow IV infusion of 1g calcium gluconate 1o mL (1o% solution) is given.
other options:
options B, C, and D: Nifedipine (calcium channel blocker), and ritodrine, isoxsuprine
(beta-adrenergic agonists) are used as tocolytics in preterm labor.",,A,
Q3,The correct statement regarding the physiological changes in the respiratory system in pregnancy?,"a)Minute volume decreases by 5o%
b)Residual volume increases
c)FRc decreases
d)Total lung capacity increases","Functional residual capacity (FRC) decreases by 2o to 3o percent (4oo to 7oo mL) during pregnancy.
FRC = Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV) + Residual Volume (RV). ERV decreases by 15 to 2o percent (2oo to 3oo mL). RV decreases by 2o to 25 percent (2oo to 4oo mL).
FRC and RV decline due to diaphragm elevation. significant reductions occur by the sixth month with a progressive decline across pregnancy.
The increased minute ventilation during pregnancy is influenced by various factors. These include the stimulatory action of progesterone, reduced expiratory reserve volume, and compensatory
respiratory alkalosis. Total lung capacity (FRC + IC) decreases in pregnancy.
Anatomical changes such as the elevation of the diaphragm, an increase in the subcostal angle, and an expansion of the transverse diameter of the thoracic cage are seen.
Respiratory changes in pregnancy are given below:
(Mnemonic: TIMM increases in pregnancy)

Increase	Decrease	unaffected
Tidal volume	Functional residual capacity	Respiratory rate
Inspiratory capacity (IC)	Expiratory reserve volume	Vital capacity
Minute o2uptake	Residual volume	Inspiratory reserve volum e

Q4,"on finding a congenital heart block in a fetus, which of the following conditions would you evaluate for in the mother?","a)APLA syndrome
b)Congenital heart defects
c)SLE
d)Hemolytic anaemia","on finding a congenital heart block in the fetus, the mother should be evaluated for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Fetal and neonatal heart blocks occur due to myocarditis and fibrosis in the region between the Av node and the bundle of His. congenital heart block primarily develops in fetuses of women  with antibodies to the SS-A or SS-B antigens, and up to 5o percent of women with SLE test
positive for these antibodies. So in pregnancies with either of these antibodies, fetal cardiac monitoring is performed between 18 and 26 weeks of gestation.
The cardiac lesion is permanent, and in most cases, a pacemaker is required. Maternal
hydroxychloroquine therapy is associated with a reduced incidence of fetal heart block,
particularly in women who have previously had an affected child.
Neonatal lupus erythematosus is thought to be caused by the transplacental passage of maternal    antibodies. It is characterized by skin lesions known as lupus dermatitis in newborns, as well as     various hematological and systemic abnormalities. In some cases, congenital heart block may also occur. Thrombocytopenia and hepatic involvement are also seen.
The most common cutaneous finding in neonatal lupus erythematosus is an erythematous,
slightly scaly eruption on the face and periorbital skin (raccoon sign/owl eye/eye mask). The
eruption can be exacerbated by Uv exposure. The rash improves over the first few months of life and usually resolves without scarring by 12 months of age.
Avoidance of sunlight should be advised and low■potency topical steroids may be of benefit.
The pregnancy outcomes are best in women with:
•  Dormant lupus activity for at least 6 months before conception
•  No lupus nephritis manifestation in the form of proteinuria or renal dysfunction
• Absent anti-phospholipid syndrome or lupus anticoagulant
•  Superimposed preeclampsia does not develop",,C,
Q5,"A 33 weeks multigravida woman presents with epigastric pain, headache, visual symptoms, and proteinuria - 3+. The next step of management would be?","a)Immediate c - section
b)Dexamethasone for fetal lung maturity
c)Induction - vaginal delivery
d)MgSo4 IV","The given clinical scenario of a 33 weeks pregnant woman with epigastric pain, headache, visual     symptoms, and proteinuria 3+ indicates severe preeclampsia. The next step of management would be iv administration of MgSo4 for the prevention of seizures.
Preeclampsia can be classified as severe if any of the following are present:
• BP ≥16o/11o
• Headache
• visual disturbance
• Upper abdominal pain



• Elevated creatinine, oliguria
• Thrombocytopenia (&lt;1,oo,ooo cells per mm3)
• pulmonary edema
• Marked elevation in serum transaminases
• Fetal growth restriction
Dexamethasone (option B) is also given in severe preeclampsia &lt;34 weeks for fetal lung
maturity. But the administration of Mgso4 before corticosteroids would be the next best step for the prevention of seizures.
Immediate delivery (options A and C) is not indicated in this case as the patient doesn't have any contraindication for conservative management. Conservative management is contraindicated in   the following cases:
• persistent symptoms, refractory to treatment or severe hypertension
• Eclampsia, pulmonary edema, HELLp syndrome
• significant renal dysfunction or coagulopathy
• placental abruption
• Nonreassuring fetal status
• Fetal demise
• Disseminated intravascular coagulation
• stroke, myocardial infarction
Mgso4 regimens for management of eclampsia and severe preeclampsia:
Magnesium sulfate is discontinued either 24 hours after delivery or 24 hours after the onset of convulsions (whichever is later).

Q6,All of the followings are seen in GDM except:,"a)Malformations
b)polyhydramnios
c)Fetal Macrosomia
d)Neonatal Hypoglycemia","Malformations are not associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Malformations occur due to the disruption of organogenesis, usually occurring in the first trimester. The abnormal
glycemic status in GDM manifests only in the second trimester.
overt diabetes (pregestational diabetes) is associated with higher rates of malformations
compared to the general population. Neural tube defects (encephalocele, meningomyelocele,     anencephaly), transposition of great vessels (TGA), ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD), hypoplastic left heart, aortic stenosis and coarctation of the aorta are commonly   seen.
Caudal regression syndrome is rare, but a specific anomaly seen in infants of diabetic mothers. Small left colon syndrome is a rare anomaly that develops in the second and third trimesters.
other options:
option B:  In GDM, increased blood glucose in the mother leads to fetal hyperglycemia. This can cause polyhydramnios due to increased fetal urine production.
option C: Fetal hyperinsulinemia causes increased hepatic glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis, accelerated lipogenesis, and augmented protein synthesis resulting in macrosomia
option D: Fetal hyperglycemia in GDM triggers fetal hyperinsulinemia, resulting in neonatal hypoglycemia",,A,
Q7,Hormone replacement therapy is not indicated for:,"a)Hot flashes
b)CAD prophylaxis
c)osteoporosis
d)premature menopause","Hormone replacement therapy is not indicated in coronary artery disease prophylaxis. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the initiation or continuation of either estrogen    therapy (ET) or estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT) for the prevention of primary or secondary



coronary heart disease (cHD).
In an 18-year reevaluation ofwHI (women health initiative) participants, it was found that cardiovascular, cancer, and all-cause mortality rates were essentially the same in both the   hormone therapy (HT) and placebo groups.
currently, hormone therapy (HT) is only indicated for the treatment of bothersome vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and genitourinary symptoms, prevention of osteoporosis, and treatment of    hypoestrogenism caused by hypogonadism, surgical menopause, or premature ovarian
insufficiency.
Estrogen should not be used in women with the following conditions:
• undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding
• known, suspected, or history of breast cancer
• known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia
• active or prior venous thromboembolism
• active or prior stroke, myocardial infarction, or transient ischemic attack (TIA)
• known thrombophilia, liver dysfunction, or disease
• untreated hypertension
• known hypersensitivity to the ingredients of the estrogen preparation
• known or suspected pregnancy
Risks of HRT:
• Endometrial cancer
• Breast cancer
• ovarian cancer
• Thromboembolism
• Lipid profile dysfunction
• Gall stones, liver dysfunction",,B,
Q8,The risk of fetal varicella syndrome is maximum when the mother is infected between _____.,"a)6 to 1o weeks
b)8 to 12 weeks
c)13 to 2o weeks
d)2o to 28 weeks","The risk of developing fetal varicella syndrome (congenital varicella syndrome) is highest when the mother develops varicella infection between 13 to 2o weeks.
congenital varicella syndrome occurs in 2% of infants with maternal varicella between 13 and 2o weeks of gestation and in o.4% of infants before 13 weeks of gestation. It is rare after 2o weeks.
congenital varicella syndrome is characterized by cicatricial skin scarring in a zoster-like pattern (zig-zag scarring), and limb hypoplasia (shown below). They can also present with neurological    abnormalities (microcephaly, cortical atrophy, mental retardation), ophthalmic features
(chorioretinitis, microphthalmia, cataract), and renal and autonomic system abnormalities (hydronephrosis, neurogenic bladder). Low birth weight is also common.



Infants born to mothers with varicella in the period from 5 days prior to delivery up to 2 days after delivery are at high risk for severe neonatal varicella. They acquire the infection
transplacentally.
since the mother has not developed a strong antibody response, the infant lacks the protective
effect of maternal anti-varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibodies.  Therefore varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) should be administered as soon as possible after birth to newborns whose
mothers have varicella 5 days before and up to 2 days after the delivery.
since perinatally acquired varicella can be potentially life-threatening, the infant should typically be treated with intravenous acyclovir (1o mg/kg every 8 hours) when lesions appear.
For pregnant women with uncomplicated primary varicella or herpes zoster that does not require hospitalization, the recommended treatment is oral acyclovir (8oo mg five times daily for seven    days).",,C,5865-3692.PNG
Q9,The loading dose of Mgso4 in pre-eclampsia is?,"a)4 ml Mgso4 (5o% w/v) in 16 ml Ns
b)8 ml Mgso4 (5o% w/v) in 12 ml Ns
c)12 ml Mgso4 (5o% w/v) in 8 ml Ns
d)1o ml Mgso4 (5o% w/v)","The loading dose of Mgso4 is 8ml Mgso4 (5o% w/v) in 12ml Ns. For loading dose IV infusion of 4g of 2o% solution is needed.
one 2mL vial has 1g Mgso4. Therefore, to make a 2o% solution containing 4g of Mgso4, we      would need to take 8 mL of 5o% magnesium sulfate, and dilute it with 12 mL Ns. Therefore the final 2omL solution (8+12) would have 4g of Mgso4, making it a 2o% solution.
Mgso4 is used as an anticonvulsant in the management of eclampsia and as prophylaxis in severe preeclampsia. The therapeutic level of magnesium in eclampsia is 4–7 mEq/L. Measurement of
serum magnesium levels is indicated to monitor magnesium toxicity if serum creatinine &gt;1.o mg/dL.
Mgso4 regimens for management of eclampsia and severe preeclampsia:
Repeat injections of magnesium sulfate are continued only if the patellar reflex is present,
respiratory rate is &gt;12, and urine output is &gt;3o mL/h. Magnesium sulfate is discontinued



either 24 hours after delivery or 24 hours after the onset of convulsions (whichever is later).
Loss of patellar reflex is the first sign of Mgso4 toxicity and occurs when the plasma magnesium level reaches 1o mEq/L. Elevated magnesium levels above 1o mEq/L weaken breathing, while 12   mEq/L or higher levels can lead to respiratory paralysis and arrest.

Q10,Drug of choice for treatment of pregnant woman with bacterial vaginosis?,"a)Metronidazole
b)Flucanazole
c)clindamycin
d)Erythromycin","The preferred treatment for bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy is either oral metronidazole 5oo mg BD for 7 days (or intravaginal metronidazole for 5 days). Treatment is typically reserved for
symptomatic women.
An alternative option is oral clindamycin, 3oo mg BD for 7 days (or intravaginal clindamycin ovules for 3 days).
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by a decrease in lactobacilli and an overgrowth of
anaerobic bacterial species, including gardnerella, prevotella, mobiluncus, and bacteroides. Most   women with BV are asymptomatic, but those with symptoms may experience a foul-smelling, thin vaginal discharge.
The clinical diagnosis of BV is based on the presence of three out of four Amsel criteria: elevated vaginal pH (&gt;4.5), thin non inflammatory discharge, &gt;2o% clue cells, and a fishy odor
(positive whiff test) after adding 1o% KoH (potassium hydroxide) to a vaginal sample.
BV is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, preterm premature
rupture of membranes, and postpartum endometritis. It also increases susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.

Q11,A 4o-year-old female presented with a history of profuse vaginal discharge. The discharge has a fishy odour. which of the following best describes the microscopic finding given below?,"a)Epithelial cell with bacteria attached on cell surface
b)Bacteria engulfed by macrophages
c)Neutrophil englufed bacteria
d)Bacteria arranged in clusters","The given clinical scenario of women with fishy odor vaginal discharge is suggestive of bacterial vaginosis (BV). The microscopic finding is vaginal epithelial cells with bacteria attached to their surface called clue cells, creating a poorly defined cellular border. They are the most reliable
indicators of BV.
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by a decrease in lactobacilli and an overgrowth of anaerobic bacterial species, including gardnerella, prevotella,mobiluncus, and bacteroides.
Multiple or new sexual partners, having female partners, and engaging in oral sex are associated  with a higher risk of BV. They may experience a foul-smelling (fishy odor) thin vaginal discharge.
The clinical diagnosis of BV is based on the presence of three out of four Amsel criteria: elevated vaginal pH (&gt;4.5), thin noninflammatory discharge, &gt;2o% clue cells, and a fishy odor

BV is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, preterm premature
rupture of membranes, and postpartum endometritis. It also increases susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.
The recommended treatment options in nonpregnant women include oral
metronidazole, metronidazole gel, or clindamycin cream. Alternative options include oral secnidazole, tinidazole, or clindamycin. partner treatment is not needed.",5855-3688.PNG,A,
Q12,The following instrument is used for _____,"a)VIA
b)VILI
c)PAP smear
d)colposcopy","The image shown is that ofAyre’s spatula which is used for preparing pAp smear. The papanicolaou test (pap test) is a screening test for cervical cancer.



The squamocolumnar junction is scraped using Ayre's spatula by rotating it around the cervix.
The obtained scrapings are spread evenly onto a glass slide and immediately fixed in a solution of 95% ethyl alcohol and ether. After 3o minutes of fixation, the slide is air-dried and then stained     with pap or a short stain method.
prerequisites for pap smear testing:
• should be done prior to vaginal examination.
• Lubricants should not be used.
• The patient should not be menstruating during the pap test.
• The ideal time is around ovulation.
• The patient should not have had intercourse in the 24hrs prior to the test. screening guidelines:
• Time for initiation: 21 years, regardless of the age of first sexual intercourse.
• women aged 21-29 years: pap test every 3 years
• women who are aged 3o-65 years: pap test + HpV testing (co-test) every 5 years or pap alone every 3 years.
• women should stop having cervical cancer screening after the age of 65 years. If suspicious pAp, screening till 75 years.
• HIV+ women: annual checkup until three consecutive negative tests followed by testing every 3 years for life.

Q13,Anti-D vaccine is not given in which of the following conditions?,"a)Amniocentesis at 16 weeks
b)Manual removal of placenta
c)Intrauterine transfusion at 28 weeks
d)MTP at 63 days","The anti-D vaccine is not given in intrauterine transfusion at 28 weeks. Intrauterine transfusion is done in alloimmunized pregnancies, where the maternal immune system (Rh negative) has
already been exposed to the fetal blood (Rh positive).
The purpose of the anti-D vaccine is to prevent the development of maternal antibodies against fetal red cells, which is already occurring in alloimmunized pregnancies.
Anti-D vaccine is administered only in ICT-negative non-isoimmunized pregnancies.
Intrauterine transfusion is done when the peak systolic velocity of the middle cerebral artery
(MCA) exceeds 1.5 multiples of the median or if hydrops develop or if the fetal hematocrit is
&lt;3o%. This indicates that the mother already has antibodies against the fetus's red blood cells, making the administration of anti-D unnecessary.
The indications for administering anti-D are:
• pregnancy loss: spontaneous or elective abortion (option D) and ectopic pregnancy.
• Fetal death: Regardless of the trimester.
• procedures: such as amniocentesis (option A), chorionic villus sampling, fetal blood sampling, and molar pregnancy evacuation.
• other situations: Antepartum bleeding (including threatened abortion), delivery (vaginal or
cesarean), external cephalic version, placental abruption, manual removal of placenta (option B), and trauma to the abdomen during pregnancy.
All Rh D-negative women should be given a single dose of 3oo mcg of anti-D at 28 weeks of pregnancy (ICT should be negative).",,C,5869-3695.PNG

Q16,which of the following agents cause hydrops fetalis?,"a)CMV
b)Parvovirus
c)Toxoplasma
d)HIV","parvovirus B19 is the most common infectious cause of nonimmune hydrops fetalis. parvovirus
B19 infects fetal erythroid progenitor cells and causes anemia. severe anemia leads to high-output cardiac failure and nonimmune hydrops fetalis.
Hydrops is diagnosed by identifying two or more fetal effusions, such as pleural, pericardial, or ascitic effusions, or the presence of one effusion along with anasarca. Hydrops can be seen in     association with red cell auto immunization, which is termed immune hydrops. otherwise, it is nonimmune.
Nonimmune hydrops is more common than immune hydrops. causes of nonimmune hydrops    include cardiac pathology (Ebstein anomaly), chromosomal (Turner's syndrome), hematological (hemoglobinopathies), lymphatic abnormalities (cystic hygroma), and thoracic abnormalities.
Infectious causes of nonimmune hydrops are parvovirus B19 (most common), syphilis,
cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, rubella, enterovirus, varicella, herpes simplex, coxsackievirus, listeriosis, leptospirosis, chagas disease, and Lyme disease.
