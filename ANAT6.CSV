Q1,The movements at the ____________joint permit a person to look to the right and left.,"a) Atlanto-occipital
b) Atlanto-axial
c) C2-C3
d) C3-C4","The movements at the atlanto-axial joint allow a person to look left and right.
The atlanto-axial joints include 3 synovial joints:
• Median atlanto-axial joint- The central pivot joint between the dens of the axis and a ring formed by the anterior arch and transverse atlantal ligament
• Lateral atlanto-axial joints- plain synovial joints between lateral masses of atlas and upper facets of the body of axis
Movements at the atlanto-axial joint almost exclusively is rotation around the axis, which help side-to-side rotation of the head. The normal range of atlanto-axial rotation is about 4o°.",,B,147-143.PNG
Q2,All of the following are true about the right coronary artery except _____,"a) It's diameter is less than left coronary artery
b) It arises from the anterior aortic sinus
c) It gives rise to circumflex coronary branch
d) Right conal artery is it's first branch","The right coronary artery does not give rise to the circumflex coronary artery.
The right coronary artery arises from the anterior aortic sinus (right coronary sinus) of the ascending aorta. It passes anteriorly and descends vertically in the coronary sulcus between the right atrium and the right ventricle. on reaching the inferior margin, it turns posteriorly and continues in the sulcus onto the diaphragmatic surface and the base of the heart.
The diameter of the right coronary artery is less than that of the left coronary artery.
The right conal artery is, usually the first branch of the right coronary artery.
The circumflex coronary artery is a branch of the left coronary artery and is the exclusive supplier to the right bundle branch.",,C,92-88.PNG
Q3,what is the basis for the formation of omphalocele?,"a) Excessive length of the intestine
b) physiological hernia failing to go back
c) Herniation of liver
d) Herniation of umbilicus","omphalocele is protrusion of abdominal contents through the umbilical ring. It is due to failure of physiological hernia to reduce into the abdominal cavity, which results in non-closure of the umbilical ring. .
An omphalocele may contain stomach, liver, and intestines. And these contents are enclosed in a sac.
omphalocele is usually associated with other congenital anomalies (e.g., trisomy 13, trisomy 18, or Beckwith-wiedemann syndrome) and with increased levels of α-fetoprotein.
Note: In gastroschisis, there is an absence of a membranous sac and is paraumbilical.",,B,148-144.PNG

Q15,Foot drop is caused by damage to:,"a) common peroneal nerve
b) Femoral nerve
c) Tibial nerve
d) sciatic nerve","Foot drop is caused by damage to the common peroneal nerve.
The common peroneal nerve is a component of the sciatic nerve. In the posterior thigh, it supplies the short head of the biceps femoris. It curves around the neck of the fibula deep to peroneus longus and divides into superficial and deep peroneal nerves.
• The superficial peroneal nerve innervates peroneus longus and peroneus brevis which are the evertors of the foot and to the skin over the dorsal area of the foot except for the first webspace and lateral side of the little toe.
• The deep peroneal nerve innervates all muscles of the anterior compartment which are the dorsiflexors of the foot, extensor digitorum brevis, first two dorsal interossei muscles, and skin between great and second toes.
Hence, injury to the common peroneal nerve will lead to:
• weakness of dorsiflexion of foot or foot drop
• Loss of eversion
• Loss of extension of toes
• sensory loss
• Anterior and lateral side of the leg
• Dorsum of the foot including the medial side of the great toe
Th image given below shows the course of common peroneal nerve.",,A,153-150.PNG
Q16,which of the following is true regarding De Quervain’s tenosynovitis?,"a) Fingers are held in mild extension

d) Treatment is surgery","De Quervain's disease is a stenosing tenosynovitis of the extensor tendons of the first dorsal compartment, namely extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) and abductor pollicis longus (APL).
It is prominent among females, especially pregnant women. Most commonly thumb is involved.
Finkelstein's test: on grasping the patient’s thumb and quickly abducting the hand ulnar ward, the pain over the radial styloid tip is excruciating. It’s the most pathognomonic objective sign but is also seen in other conditions like radial nerve entrapment and arthritis.
Treatment:
• Majority of the patients are treated medically
• only few require the release of the 1st dorsal compartment which houses the APL and EPB tendons.",,B,
