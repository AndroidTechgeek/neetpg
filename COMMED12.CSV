Q1,"In a village, it is observed that several farmers have crossed gait and use a stick for support to stand up and walk. Due to poor yield from farms, they consume meals containing rice and
pulses only. supplementing their diet with which of the following vitamins could have prevented this?","a)vitamin A
b)vitamin D
c)vitamin C
d)vitamin B","The likely diagnosis based on the given clinical scenario is neurolathyrism.  Administration of vitamin C at doses of 5oo-1ooo mg is beneficial for this.
Lathyrism is a paralyzing disease of humans and animals. It is due to the consumption ofkhesari   dal or Lathyrus sativus. when the husk is removed, it looks similar to red gram or Bengal gram. It is mostly consumed by poor agricultural laborers because it is relatively cheap. Lathyrism is more  prevalent in parts of Madhya pradesh, uttar pradesh, odisha, and Bihar. The prevention of Food   Adulteration Act in India has banned Lathyrus sativus in all forms (whole/ split/ flour).
In humans, it is referred to as neurolathyrism because it affects the nervous system. It
is characterized by gradually developing spastic paralysis of the lower limbs. Beta-oxalyl amino alanine (BoAA) is the toxic compound causing this disease. It is water-soluble and can be
removed by the following methods:
• Soaking pulses in hot water and discarding the water
• overnight soaking in lime water, followed by boiling
• parboiling - for large-scale detoxification",,C,
Q2,"A 35-year-old homeless man presented with a 1-month history of fever, cough, and weight loss. Both sputum smears turned out to be negative, but the chest x-ray ordered was
suggestive of tuberculosis. According to the recent NTEP guidelines, which is the next best line of management?","a)Repeat sputum smears
b)Ask for CBNAAT
c)Ask for line probe assay
d)wait until TB culture results to start ATT","The given case with the classical symptoms of evening rise of temperature and productive cough of more than 2 weeks in duration prompts a diagnosis of pulmonary
tuberculosis. According to the NTEp guidelines, the next best line of management is CBNAAT.
The initial diagnosis of pulmonary TB is done with sputum smear examination and chest
radiography. Chest radiography features suggestive of TB include upper lobe infiltrates and
cavities. However, these are not very specific to TB. The presence of these features should prompt microbiological evaluation for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
A positive smear examination, irrespective of CXR findings, is considered as microbiologically
positive with sensitivity status unknown. Drug sensitivity status via NAAT is to be done following a sputum smear before initiation of treatment. This helps in the early detection and treatment of  drug-resistant TB. This has been integrated into the regular TB services to detect rifampicin
resistance at the time of diagnosis. Depending on the sensitivity of the tubercle bacilli, appropriate ATT is started.
In cases of high clinical suspicion, positive CXR findings, or in people with HIV, a CB-NAAT is done. Two sputum samples are sent for cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification (CBNAAT),  which detects the presence of Mycobacterium DNA along with resistance against rifampicin
within 2 hours. It analyses sputum or any other biological specimen (except blood and blood-contaminated specimens) using real-time pCR technology.
The interpretation of CBNAAT is as follows:
• If the CBNAAT turns out to be positive/MTB detected, the 2nd sample is sent for culture and drug sensitivity testing (C&amp;DST) immediately.
• If the CBNAAT turns out to be negative for rifampicin resistance, a first-line line probe assay is ordered, to look for isoniazid resistance.



• If FL-LPA shows no resistance to isoniazid, the patient is treated as drug-sensitive, and a conventional daily regime of 2HRZE and 4HRE is given.
• If FL-LPA shows resistance to isoniazid, reflex testing is done using second-line line probe assay (SL-LPA).
• If SL-LPA turns out to be negative, treat as isoniazid or H-mono-/poly-resistance
• If SL-LPA turns out to be resistant to some drugs, modify the treatment regime accordingly.
• If CBNAAT is positive for rifampicin resistance, the second sample is sent for first-line line probe assay (FL-LPA), second-line line probe assay (SL-LPA), and BACTEC MGIT 96o to look for
isoniazid (H) mono-/poly-resistance
• If there is no resistance/H-mono-/poly- resistance, treat as shorter oral bedaquiline-containing MDR regime.
• If there is resistance, then treat as longer oral bedaquiline-containing MDR regime.
• If the 2nd sample also turns out to be indeterminate, a fresh sample is taken for LPA or liquid culture, to ascertain drug resistance. Meanwhile, treatment initiation is done and modified
subsequently, as per results.
other options:
option A: Repeat sputum smears are not the next best line of management in this case, as the patient already had two negative sputum smears and a chest x-ray suggestive of tuberculosis.
option C: Line probe assay would not be the immediate next step in management. First, CBNAAT should be performed to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis and identify rifampicin resistance.
option D: waiting for TB culture results to start ATT is not the best management strategy, as it can take several weeks for the results to come back, and the patient may deteriorate in the
meantime.",,B,
Q3,"Research is being conducted to find the association between aniline dye exposure and bladder cancer in workers who have worked in the industry for &gt;2o years. Two groups were
formed: one directly involved with dye handling and the other group consisting of office     clerks not directly exposed to the dye. years of occupation were noted from records. what type of study is being performed?","a)Retrospective cohort study
b)Prospective cohort study
c)Case-control study
d)Intervention and response","The study given here is a retrospective cohort study.
A retrospective cohort study is when both the exposure and outcome have occurred before the investigations and study is undertaken.
In this scenario, the workers in the industry were divided into two groups, viz those who are
directly exposed and the clerical staff who are not directly exposed to the suspected carcinogen.    The incidence of carcinogenesis among these two groups is studied going backward tracking their records.
An increased risk of bladder cancer was observed among long-term workers directly exposed to
the chemical in aniline dye industries when compared with the other study group. It is also called  a historical cohort study, a prospective study in retrospect, or a non-concurrent prospective study. The cohort is identified from past records and is assessed to date for the outcome. The same
cohort is followed up prospectively in the future for further assessment of the outcome.
other options:



option B - Prospective cohort study: This type of study involves following a group of participants  over time and monitoring their exposure to a risk factor and the development of an outcome. In    this case, the outcome (bladder cancer) and exposure (aniline dye) have already occurred, making this a retrospective cohort study.
option C - Case-control study: A case-control study involves comparing individuals with a specific  outcome (cases) to those without the outcome (controls) and assessing their exposure history. This study design is not being used in the given scenario, as the workers are divided into two groups
based on their exposure status and followed for the development of bladder cancer.
option D - Intervention and response: This option is not a type of epidemiological study design. It could refer to an intervention study, in which an intervention is applied to a group of participants, and the response is measured. However, this is not applicable to the current scenario.",,A,
Q4,"The blood pressure of a population was tracked from childhood to adulthood. It was observed that those who had lower BP in childhood had low BP in adulthood, while those who had
higher BP in childhood had high BP in adulthood. This can be best described as____","a)Rule of halves
b)Tracking of blood pressure
c)STEPwise approach
d)Primordial approach","The above phenomenon is best described as the ""tracking"" of blood pressure.
In this phenomenon, the blood pressure of individuals is followed up from early childhood into
adulthood. The BP in individuals with low BP levels tend to remain low, and in those with high BP levels, they tend to remain high. This phenomenon of persistence of rank order of blood pressure   has been described as ""tracking"".
other options:
option A: The rule of halves depicts the disease burden of hypertension in the community. It
states that only about half of the hypertensive subjects in the general population are aware of the condition. only half of those aware are being treated and only half of those being treated are
considered to be adequately treated.
A pictorial representation of the rule of halves in hypertension is shown below:


option B: The WHo STEPwise approach to non-communicable disease (NCD) risk factor
surveillance (STEPS) is a simple, standardized method for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating



data on key NCD risk factors such as tobacco use, alcohol use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, overweight and obesity, raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, and abnormal blood lipids.",,B,2585-1604.PNG
Q5,"A 3o-week primigravida c/o reduced vision at night. She has been avoiding papaya, mango,    and other fruits throughout her pregnancy as she thinks they could be abortifacients. It is the primary duty of which of the following workers to provide counseling and information to the  patient?","a)ANM
b)AWW
c)Trained birth attendant
d)ASHA","Amongst the given options, it is the duty of the ASHA to provide counseling and information to this pregnant patient
An ASHA is a trained female community health activist and a resident woman of the village with a formal education of at least up to 1oth grade. She should preferably be in the age group of 25 to
45 years (married/divorced/widow) and have qualities such as good communication skills and leadership skills. The general norm of selection recommends having one ASHA for 1ooo
population, but in tribal, hilly, and desert areas, the norm could be relaxed to one ASHA per habitation.
Roles ofASHA:
• To create awareness and provide information to the community on determinants of health such as nutrition, basic sanitation, and hygienic practices
• To counsel women on birth preparedness, the importance of safe delivery, breast-feeding and complementary feeding, immunization, and contraception
• To counsel women on the prevention of common infections including reproductive tract infection/sexually transmitted infection
• To mobilize the community and help them in accessing health and health-related services.
• To arrange and escort pregnant women and children requiring treatment/admission to the nearest pre-identified health facility
• To inform sub-center/primary health center about the births and deaths in her village and any unusual health problems/disease outbreaks in the community
• To promote the construction of household toilets under the total sanitation campaign other options:
option A (ANM): An Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) is a trained health worker who provides
basic healthcare services, including antenatal care, delivery, and postnatal care. Although an ANM can provide counseling and information to pregnant women, the primary responsibility for this
role lies with the ASHA worker.
option B (AWW): An Anganwadi Worker (AWW) is responsible for providing basic health care, nutrition, and preschool education to children under the age of six, pregnant women, and
lactating mothers. While AWWs play a vital role in maternal and child health, counseling pregnant women on health-related issues is not their primary responsibility.
option C (Trained birth attendant): A trained birth attendant is responsible for assisting with
childbirth and providing postpartum care. Although they may provide some counseling and
information, this role is primarily focused on the delivery process rather than ongoing counseling throughout pregnancy.",,D,
Q6,"A 22-year-old female comes to the STI clinic with minimal vaginal discharge. on speculum examination, erosions are seen on the cervix. Which of the following kit should be given to this patient?","a)Green
b)Red
c)Gray
d)yellow","This patient with vaginal discharge and erosions on the cervix has cervicitis from a sexually
transmitted infection. she should be given the gray kit which contains cefixime and azithromycin.
under the sTD control program, pre-packed color-coded kits have been provided for free supply to treat sexually transmitted (sTI) or reproductive tract infections (RTI). Management of sTDs     under the syndromic approach is based on specific signs and symptoms and is not dependent on laboratory investigations.
A patient with just vaginal discharge is presumed to have vaginitis and is given a green kit that
contains secnidazole and fluconazole. But this patient also has cervical erosion, which is a sign of cervicitis. she should be treated with the grey kit. This kit contains a single tablet of 1 gram
azithromycin for chlamydia and a single tablet of 4oo mg cefixime for gonorrhea.",,C,
Q7,The years of potential life lost could be attributed to______.,"a)years lost to morbidity
b)years lost due to premature death
c)years lost to disability
d)years lost to poor quality of life","The years of potential life lost could be attributed to the years lost due to premature death.
It is a mortality indicator that shows the number of years that a dying person could have expected to survive (usually taken as 75 years). Mortality indicators are used as the starting point in the
evaluation of health status. They are used as indirect indicators of health.
The concept of years of potential life lost (YPLL) is used to estimate the societal impact of
premature death. It helps prioritize public health interventions and allocate resources to address significant health problems. YPLL, along with other metrics like DALYs and QALYs, aids in
assessing the burden of disease and the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. These
measurements can help inform policymakers and healthcare providers in making informed decisions about healthcare delivery and resource allocation.
strategies to reduce YPLL include prevention and early intervention, improving access to
healthcare, and addressing social determinants of health that contribute to health disparities and premature death.
other options:
option A: Years lost to morbidity refers to the time spent living with a disease or disability, which is not directly related to the concept of years of potential life lost.
option C: Years lost to disability is a component of disability-adjusted life years (DALY). DALY indicates the number of years lost due to ill health, disability, or early death.
DALY = YLL +YLD
• Years lost to disability (YLD): Here, the number of cases due to injury and illness is multiplied by the average duration of the disease and a weighting factor. (severity of the disease on a scale of o   (perfect health) to 1 (dead))
• Years of lost life (YLL) - Here, the number of deaths at each age is multiplied by the expected remaining years of life. (according to a global standard of life expectancy)
option D: Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) indicates how the health status of an individual
impacts his quality and quantity of life. It shows the years of life lost due to injury or illness. It is



commonly used in evaluating the outcomes of medical interventions.",,B,
Q8,"In a 1o-year-old school child, which of the following vaccines is given as a part of the school immunization program?","a)Measles vaccine
b)Rotavirus vaccine
c)TT/Td vaccine
d)Hepatitis B vaccine","A ten-year-old school child will be administered the TT/Td vaccine, as part of the school immunization program, as per the National Immunization schedule.
Tetanus and adult diphtheria (Td) vaccine is a combination of tetanus and diphtheria antigens, with a lower concentration of diphtheria antigen (d), as recommended for older children and
adults. The MoHFW recommends the replacement ofthe TT vaccine with Td vaccine for all age   groups, including pregnant women. A dose of o.5 mL is administered in the intramuscular route in the upper arm.
scheduled to be administered at 1o and 16 years of age.
For pregnant women:
• Td-1: early in pregnancy
• Td-2: 4 weeks after Td-1
• Td (Booster): if pregnancy occurs within 3 years of the last pregnancy and 2 Td doses were received.
other options:
option A - According to the National Immunization schedule, Measles/MR vaccine is given at 9     completed months (1st dose), and a second dose is given at 16-24 months. Measles vaccine can be given till 5 years of age. A dose of o.5 mL is administered subcutaneously in the right upper arm.
option B - Rotavirus vaccines are oral, live attenuated vaccines and are of 3 types: Rotavac, RotaTeq, and Rotarix. Rotavac (monovalent liquid frozen) vaccine is administered in 3 oral doses, 4 weeks apart at 6, 1o, and 14 weeks. Though CDC guidelines recommend that it
should not be administered to children more than 8 months of age, the National Immunisation     Guidelines in India mention that the first dose of rotavirus vaccine can be administered up to the age of 1 year.
option D - Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of a subunit vaccine made using HBsAg. The first
dose (o.5 mL, intramuscular) is given at birth or as early as possible within 24 hours on the
anterolateral side of mid-thigh. subsequent doses are given as a part of the pentavalent vaccine at 6 weeks, 1o weeks, and 14 weeks (can be given until one year of age).",,C,
Q9,which of the following statements is true about cancer treatment according to the colombo plan?,"a)Help with PET scan units for diagnosis of cancer
b)Human resource strengthening
c)setting up chemotherapy units
d)setting up cobalt therapy units","Aid to set up cobalt therapy units for cancer treatment at medical institutions in India was a part of the Colombo plan.
The Colombo plan is a regional organization that upholds the concept of a collective
intergovernmental effort to strengthen the economic and social development of member countries in the Asia-pacific region.



It was formed at a meeting of the commonwealth foreign ministers with the headquarters at colombo in January 195o. It comprises 2o developing countries within the region and 6
non-regional members - Australia, canada, Japan, New zealand, the Uk, and USA. It
involves foreign aid and technical assistance for the economic and social development of the region.
The contribution of canada in supplying cobalt therapy units to medical institutions in India was an important item of aid under the colombo plan. AIIMS New Delhi was established with
financial assistance from New zealand under the colombo plan. cobalt therapy is a form of
radiotherapy that uses cobalt-6o, a radioactive isotope, to generate high-energy gamma rays for
treating cancer. cobalt therapy units were an important tool for cancer treatment in the mid-2oth century, and their provision under the colombo plan significantly improved cancer treatment
capabilities in India.
The colombo plan has evolved over the years and now focuses on a broader range of development goals, including education, public administration, agriculture, and industry. This reflects the
changing needs of the Asia-pacific region and the importance of a comprehensive approach to development.
other options:
option A (Help with pET scan units for diagnosis of cancer): while pET scan units are important for cancer diagnosis, they were not part of the colombo plan's cancer treatment initiatives in
India.
option B (Human resource strengthening): Although the colombo plan aims to improve the    economic and social development of member countries, human resource strengthening in the context of cancer treatment is not explicitly mentioned as part of the plan.
option c (Setting up chemotherapy units): The colombo plan's focus in cancer treatment was on providing aid for cobalt therapy units, not chemotherapy units.",,D,
Q10,"A poor farmer with a history of successive crop failure develops progressive spastic
paraparesis, signs of upper motor neuron paralysis, and gait instability. Name the toxin responsible for this condition.","a)Aflatoxin
b)Beta-oxalyl-amino-alanine
c)Ergot alkaloids
d)Fusarium toxin","The diagnosis based on the given clinical scenario is neurolathyrism, and the toxin responsible for the condition is beta-oxalyl-amino-alanine.
Lathyrism is a paralyzing disease of humans and animals. It is due to the consumption of khesari
dal/Lathyrus sativus. It is mostly consumed by agricultural laborers of poor economic
status because it is relatively cheap. It is more prevalent in parts of Madhya pradesh, Uttar pradesh, odisha, and Bihar.
In humans, it is referred to as neurolathyrism because it affects the nervous system. It
is characterized by gradually developing spastic paralysis of the lower limbs. In animals, it is referred to as osteolathyrism as it leads to skeletal deformities. It usually affects young
males aged 15-45 years and it is manifested in stages:
• Latent stage
• No-stick stage
• one-stick stage



• Two-stick stage
• crawler stage
Beta-oxalyl-amino-alanine (BoAA) is the toxic compound causing lathyrism. The water-soluble
property of the toxin is used in removing it from the pulses by soaking it in hot water and
rejecting the soaked water. vitamin c in doses of 5oo-1ooo mg can be used for the prevention and treatment of lathyrism.
other options:
option A: Aflatoxins are produced by certain fungi, such as Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus
parasiticus, are the most potent hepatotoxins. These fungi can contaminate food grains such as
groundnut, maize, parboiled rice, sorghum, wheat, and tapioca. It is mainly due to improper
storage. It can be prevented by proper storage after drying. Moisture content should be kept below 1o%. They do not cause the neurological symptoms described in the question.
option B: Ergot alkaloids are produced by ergot or claviceps purpurea, a field fungus. Food grains like bajra, rye, sorghum, and wheat have a tendency to get contaminated with this ergot fungus.
These get harvested along with the food grains and consumption of this ergot-infested grain leads to ergotism.
Acute cases present with nausea, vomiting, giddiness, and drowsiness for a period of up to 24 to
48 hours after the ingestion of ergot grain. In cases of chronic consumption, they present with
painful cramps in limbs, and peripheral gangrene due to vasoconstriction of capillaries. However, they do not cause the progressive spastic paraparesis and upper motor neuron paralysis
characteristic of neurolathyrism. Ergot-infested grains are removed by floating them in 2o% saltwater. Handpicking can also be done.
option D: Fusarium toxin is produced by the fungus Fusarium incarnatum. They are known to contaminate sorghum and rice.",,B,
Q11,A young male came to the hospital with a clean-cut wound without any bleeding. The patient received a full course of tetanus vaccination 1o years ago. what is the best management for    this patient?,"a)Human tetanus immunoglobulin and full course of vaccine
b)Human tetanus immunoglobulin only
c)single-dose tetanus toxoid
d)Full course tetanus toxoid","The patient with a clean-cut wound without any bleeding, who received a full course of tetanus     vaccination 1o years ago, should be given a single dose of tetanus toxoid vaccine and appropriate wound care.
wound management involves cleaning the wound thoroughly to remove soil, foreign bodies, and necrotic tissue.
Note: In cases where combined immunization is necessary, the patient is given 25o units of    human tetanus immunoglobulin in one arm and o.5 mL of adsorbed tetanus toxoid (PTAP or APT) in the other arm or gluteal region. The antitoxin is given for immediate temporary
protection, and the tetanus toxoid is given for long-lasting protection.",,C,
Q12,How is water collected for bacteriological examination during a disease outbreak?,"a)collect water from already leaking taps
b)Before collecting, let water flow for at least 1 minute
c)water sample container is kept close to the tap avoid spillage
d)collect from a gentle stream of water to avoid splashing","During a disease outbreak, for collection of a water sample for bacteriological examination from a tap in regular use, water is collected from a gentle stream of water to avoid splashing.



If water samples are to be collected from a tap that is not regularly used, they should be first
sterilized by heating. Then, the tap is cooled and opened fully and the initial water stream is let out to flow before the sample is collected.
The sample bottle must be held near the base with a hand and the stopper and paper cover over it are removed together and held in the fingers.
other options:
option A (Collect water from already leaking taps): Collecting water from leaking taps is not recommended as it increases the risk of contamination and may not provide an accurate
representation of water quality.
option B (Before collecting, let water flow for at least 1 minute): This option is close to the correct answer but falls short, as it is recommended to let the water flow for at least two minutes to flush  out stagnant water in the pipe.
option C (water sample container is kept close to the tap to avoid spillage): while keeping the  sample container close to the tap is a good practice to avoid spillage, it is not the main concern during the collection of water samples for bacteriological examination.",,D,
Q13,"The average daily dietary nutrient intake level sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of
nearly all (97-98%) healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group is known as _____.","a)Adequate intake
b)Dietary goal
c)Estimated average requirement
d)Recommended dietary allowance","The average daily dietary nutrient intake level sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group is known as
recommended dietary allowance (RDA).
Recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) are developed by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of sciences, and are part of the Dietary Reference
Intakes (DRIs). DRIs include not only RDAs but also adequate intakes (AIs), tolerable upper intake levels (ULs), and estimated average requirements (EARs).
RDAs are essential for planning and assessing diets for healthy individuals and serve as the basis  for food labeling, nutrition policy, and dietary guidelines. Meeting the RDA for a specific nutrient helps ensure that an individual's nutrient intake is sufficient to prevent deficiency and maintain    optimal health. However, individual nutrient needs may vary depending on factors such as age,    gender, health status, and activity level.
other options
option A: Adequate intake is the recommended average daily intake level which is based on
experimentally found estimates of nutrient intake by a group of apparently healthy population (assumed to be adequate). It is used when RDA cannot be determined. It is referred to as
acceptable intake in the indian context.
option B: Dietary goals are country-specific quantitative targets for selected nutrients aimed at preventing long-term chronic diseases. They are not directly focused on meeting the nutrient     requirements of individuals but rather focus on population-level nutritional health.
option C: The estimated average requirement (EAR) is the daily nutrient intake level estimated to  meet the requirements of half the healthy individuals in a specific life stage and gender group. It is used to calculate the RDA but is not the same as the RDA.



The RDA is calculated as the estimated average requirement (EAR) plus twice the standard deviation (SD).
RDA = EAR + (2 × SD)",,D,
Q14,"A boys' hostel has an outbreak of fever cases with headache, followed by the development of    pleomorphic rashes sparing palms and soles. what is the next best step in the management of suspected cases?","a)Isolate for 6 days after giving acyclovir, followed by vzIG within 72 hours of exposure
b)Isolate for 12 days after giving acyclovir, followed by vzIG within 48 hours of exposure
c)Isolate for 6 days
d)only give VZIG","The scenario describes an outbreak of fever cases with headache followed by the development of pleomorphic rashes sparing palms and soles, which points to the diagnosis of chickenpox. In a
boys' hostel, it is reasonable to assume that the majority of the affected individuals are not in the high-risk groups for severe varicella infection. For the management of suspected cases in this
situation, isolation for 6 days from the onset of the rash is the appropriate measure to prevent further spread of the infection. Acyclovir and VZIG are not necessary for healthy individuals.
Varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) is not indicated for everyone. VZIG is a passive
immunization used as post-exposure prophylaxis for individuals at high risk of developing severe varicella (chickenpox) infection after being exposed to the varicella-zoster virus. It should be
administered within 72 hours of exposure to provide the best protection, although it may still be effective if given up to 1o days after exposure.
High-risk individuals who may benefit from VZIG include
• Immunocompromised individuals, such as those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, those     with congenital cellular immunodeficiency, and those with acquired immunodeficiency, including HIV/AIDS.
• pregnant women who have been exposed to the virus and have no history of chickenpox or
vaccination, as varicella infection during pregnancy can lead to congenital varicella syndrome or severe neonatal varicella infection.
• Newborns whose mothers developed chickenpox within five days before delivery or within 48 hours after delivery, as they are at risk of severe neonatal varicella infection.
For healthy individuals who have been exposed to the varicella-zoster virus, the varicella vaccine is usually recommended as post-exposure prophylaxis, rather than VZIG. The vaccine should be  administered within 3 to 5 days of exposure to help prevent or reduce the severity of the disease.
Live attenuated vaccine is administered to children who have not had chickenpox between the age of 12 to 18 months.

Q15,"which of the following is the sensitive indicator to assess the availability, utilization, and effectiveness of healthcare in a community?","a)Infant mortality rate
b)Maternal mortality rate
c)Immunization coverage
d)Disability-adjusted life years","The infant mortality rate (IMR) is a sensitive indicator of the availability, utilization, and effectiveness of health care in a community.
Infant mortality rate (IMR) = Number of deaths in the first year of life/Total number of live births
x 1ooo.
It is one of the universally accepted healthcare indicators for the whole population and the socioeconomic conditions under which they live.
other options:
option B - Maternal mortality rate: while maternal mortality rate is an important indicator of maternal healthcare services, it is not as sensitive as the infant mortality rate in reflecting the  availability, utilization, and effectiveness of healthcare in a community.
option C - Immunization coverage: Immunization coverage is an essential factor in preventing
diseases and promoting public health. However, it is a narrower indicator than infant mortality
rate, focusing primarily on preventive healthcare services for children. Full immunization
coverage is defined as the proportion of infants 9-11 months old who have received the 3 doses of  DPT vaccine, BCG vaccine, 3 doses of oPv, and one dose of measles vaccine against the estimated number of infants during a specific year.
option D - Disability-adjusted life years: DALYs are a useful measure of the overall burden of  disease in a population, but they are less sensitive in assessing the availability, utilization, and effectiveness of healthcare services in a community compared to infant mortality rate.",,A,
