Q1,A resident doctor gets pricked with a needle while attending an HIV positive patient. The regimen to be given is?,"a)zidovudine + Lamivudine
b)zidovudine + Lamivudine + Nevirapine
c)zidovudine + Lamivudine + Indinavir
d)zidovudine + Nevirapine","Amongst the given options, a three-drug combination of zidovudine+Lamivudine+Indinavir is preferred.
Three drug combination is preferred as per the US Public health service guidelines, WHO guidelines, and MOHFW 2020 guidelines.
A PEP regimen for HIV should have Lamivudine + Tenofovir + Lopinavir/ritonavir to be taken for 4 weeks after exposure. It should ideally be started within 2 hours and definitely within 72 hours. Here as the Lopinavir/ritonavir is not part of the options, one can choose, the indinavir-based
combination as the best of the available options.
Nevirapine is not preferred for use in PEP. Previous NACO 2018 guidelines mentioned the use of
2 drug combinations but it is no longer preferred.
Exposures that may warrant occupational PEP include:
• Parenteral or mucous membrane exposure (splashes to the eye, nose, or oral cavity)
• The following bodily fluids may pose a risk of HIV infection: blood, blood-stained saliva, breast-milk, genital secretions, and cerebrospinal, amniotic, rectal, peritoneal, synovial,    pericardial, or pleural fluids.
Exposures that do not require PEP include:
• When the exposed individual is already HIV-positive
• When the source is established to be HIV-negative
• Exposure to bodily fluids that do not pose a significant risk: tears, non-blood-stained saliva, urine, and sweat.
To ensure no transmission has occurred, follow-up with HIV antibody testing should be done for at least 6 months post-exposure (e.g. at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months).

parent's/guardian's accounts whose details are to be sought and entered in nikshay against the patient’s records.
The processing of payment is on the 7th of every month.",,B,
Q6,Diphtheria vaccine is a:,"a)Polysaccharide vaccine
b)Toxoid
c)Killed vaccine
d)Live attenuated vaccine","Diptheria vaccine is a toxoid.
Toxoids: certain organisms like diphtheria and tetanus bacilli produce exotoxins. The toxins produced by these organisms are detoxicated and used in the preparation of vaccines.

c)&gt;o.oo1 IU/ml
d)&gt;o.ooo1 IU/ml","The serum level of tetanus antitoxin that gives clinical protection is o.o1 IU/ml.
Tetanus is best prevented by tetanus toxoid. It provides active immunization by stimulating the production of protective antitoxin. vaccination should be aimed at maintaining the serum
protective level of antitoxin (approximately o.o1 IU/ml) throughout life and covering
the entire community.",,B,

Q16,The HIV sentinel surveillance includes all of the following populations except,"a)single male migrants
b)Truck drivers
c)sTD clinic attendees
d)Antenatal woman","Sentinel surveillance of HIV is usually not done for STD clinic attendees.



sentinel surveillance is used to augment the notification systems used in the surveillance of diseases.
Till 2o12-13, sTD sites were also included in the HIV sentinel surveillance but from 2o14-15, these sites were entirely discontinued, since the sTD data had significant biases.

• Female sex worker: women who are engaged in consensual sex for money or payment in kind, as a means of livelihood in the last six months
• Men who had anal or oral sex with a male partner in the last month.
• Injection drug users: Men and women who use addictive substances or drugs for recreational or non-medical reasons, through injections, at least once in the last three months.

Q17,You are a medical officer at a PHC. which of the following would you advise for mass prophylaxis/ treatment for anemia?,"a)Feso4 + vit C + Folate + vit B12
b)Iron (III) hydroxide polymaltose
c)Ferrous fumarate
d)Inj. iron sucrose","Among the given options, Feso4 + vitamin C + Folate + vitamin B12 may be considered for mass prophylaxis against anemia.
Vit C enhances the absorption of iron from the stomach by acting as a reducing substance.
subclinical folate deficiency is seen in up to 3o% of North Indian pregnant women. Moreover, it may be masked by widespread iron deficiency. It is, for this reason, iron and folate
supplementation is carried out in national programmes.
Clinical vitamin B12 deficiency is not commonly encountered, but subclinical cases might be seen in up to 3o% of adults and children due to widespread restriction to consumption of vegetarian    products only. Hence supplementing vitamin B12 is a good idea provided the cost factor is not an issue.
option B: Iron (III) hydroxide polymaltose was marketed as being superior to iron sulfate in terms of efficacy, but it lacked any data to back up the evidence.
option C: Ferrous fumarate may be considered for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia with similar efficacy as that of ferrous sulfate.
option D: Injection iron sucrose or any parenteral form is not used as a first-line option. It is only indicated if the oral form is not tolerated.",,A,
Q18,which of the following quantitative methods is the best to study previous research studies?,"a)Cohort study
b)systematic review
c)Meta-analysis
d)RCT","The quantitative method which is the best to study previous research studies of a selected topic/research question is meta-analysis.
A systematic review is a process of collecting, reviewing, and presenting information from earlier research to answer a question. It is a qualitative technique. It may or may not involve a
meta-analysis.",,C,
Q19,Discrete probability distribution that expresses probability of a given number of events in a particular time frame is known as:,"a)Binomial distribution
b)Gaussian distribution
c)Poissons distribution
d)Normal distribution","Poissons distribution is the probability distribution that describes the chances of an event in a particular time frame.
For example, if you plot the number of patients visiting the oPD of your hospital for a week on a chart, you can conclude that on a particular day(say Monday) there are more number of patients.
And if the pattern of patients is similar you can estimate the number of patients in oPD next week or so.
It is usually done for rare events and is depends on μ = λt (where μ defines the number of events in happening in time t)
other options
Gaussian distribution is another name for Normal distribution
Binomial distribution examples consist of those events which can only have two possible results given as yes or no / success or failure. It is usually done for finite number of events unlike
Poissons distribution.",,C,
Q20,The data which best explains the difference between the highest and the lowest values is:,"a)Variance
b)coefficient of variation
c)Range
d)Interquartile range","Range gives the difference between the highest and lowest values in a given set of data.
In a dataset of marks of students in a subject, if the highest score is 1oo and the lowest is 51, the range would be 49.
option A: variance (var or SD²) is the mean of the squares of all the deviation scores of the distribution. It is used to measure how far data is spread out.
option B: coefficient of variation (cv) is used to compare the variability. For example, whether  the pulse varies more in old or young and growth varies more in boys or girls. It is calculated by expressing SD as a percentage of the mean, i.e., cv = SD/mean x 1oo. Since it is expressed as a   percentage it doesn't have any units.
option D: Quartiles divide the distribution into 4 equal groups. The difference between mid values of each quartile gives the interquartile range.",,C,
Q21,which of the following is a marker of the heat stability of vaccines?,"a)VMV
b)VVM
c)MVV
d)VMM","Vaccine Vial Monitors (VVM) are heat-sensitive indicators that are routinely used to monitor vaccine viability as the vaccine vial moves across the supply chain.
VVM records cumulative heat exposure through a gradual change in color. If the color of the inner square is the same or is darker than the outer circle, the vaccine has been exposed to too much
temperature and should be discarded.",,B,
