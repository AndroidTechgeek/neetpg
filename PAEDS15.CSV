Q1,"Three female children graphs were plotted on an IAP growth chart, which of them signals growth failure?","a)only 2 and 3
b)only 3
c)1, 2 and 3
d)only 1","Out of the growth curves (weight-for-age), only growth curve 3 shows growth failure. This pattern shows fluctuation in growth percentiles, which might indicate a history of growth issues or
inconsistent growth. The drop to below -2SD is significant and suggests growth failure as it indicates the child is significantly below the normal range.
The nutritional status of a child is assessed in terms of anthropometry:
The World Health Organization (WHO) has established international standards for normal child   growth from birth to 5 years of age. The normalization of the anthropometric measures is done in terms of z-scores (standard deviation scores). The anthropometric indicators are marked in a
growth chart which is compared with a reference curve.
The anthropometric measures used are weight for age, height for age, weight for height, BMI, and mid-upper arm circumference.
• Low weight for height, or wasting, indicates acute malnutrition. It is also mentioned as wasting.
• High weight-for-height indicates overweight.
• Low height-for-age, or stunting, indicates chronic malnutrition. This is the best indicator of long-term nutritional status in the pediatric population.
• Low weight-for-age indicates acute or chronic malnutrition. It does not differentiate between wasting and stunting. Hence, it has limited clinical significance.

Q2,A neonate has bilateral chorioretinitis with intraparenchymal calcifications. she also has hydrocephalus. what is the causative organism?,"a)Trypanosoma
b)Toxoplasma gondi
c)Taenia solium
d)cytomegalovirus","The presence of bilateral chorioretinitis with intraparenchymal calcifications and hydrocephalus in a neonate is suggestive of congenital toxoplasmosis.
The characteristic triad of congenital toxoplasmosis is chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and diffuse intracranial calcifications. clinical manifestations apart from the triad include hydrops fetalis,
intrauterine growth retardation, prematurity, peripheral retinal scars, persistent jaundice, and mild thrombocytopenia.
congenital toxoplasmosis occurs when a pregnant woman acquires the infection during gestation. The organism may cross to the fetus transplacentally or at the time of vaginal delivery. The
severity of the disease in the neonate is greater if the woman gets infected early in her
pregnancy. The causative agent is Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular protozoan.
The diagnosis is made by the detection of IgM anti-toxoplasma antibodies. IgG can cross the
placenta is hence, cannot confirm infection in the infant. IgM immunosorbent agglutination assay (ISAGA) and IgA ELISA are the most useful diagnostic tests.
Spiramycin can be administered for cases of acute infection in early pregnancy to reduce vertical transmission. It does not cross the placenta and therefore cannot be used to treat an infected
fetus. pyrimethamine-sulfonamide (to be avoided in the first trimester) is used when a fetal infection is confirmed or in maternal infections after 18 weeks.
other options:
option A: Trypanosoma is a genus of protozoan parasites responsible for diseases like African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and American trypanosomiasis (chagas disease). These
diseases present with different clinical features, such as fever, swollen lymph nodes, and
neurological symptoms in African trypanosomiasis, and fever, swelling at the infection site, and cardiomyopathy in chagas disease.



option c: Taenia solium is a parasitic tapeworm transmitted through undercooked pork, causing intestinal infection (taeniasis) or more severe cyst formation in tissues, including the brain
(cysticercosis). It's prevalent in regions with poor sanitation and where pork is consumed.
option D: congenital cytomegalovirus presents with hepatosplenomegaly, petechial rashes,
jaundice, chorioretinitis, and microcephaly. Head neuroimaging shows intracranial
periventricular calcifications. one of the long-term sequelae is sensorineural hearing loss.
Diagnosis is made by isolating the virus from the urine or blood by polymerase chain reaction (PcR)",,B,
Q3,what is represented by each of the following growth curves?,"a)1 - Liver, 2 - spleen, 3- ovary, 4 - Testis
b)1 - Brain, 2- Tonsils, 3 - BMI, 4 - Genital organs
c)1 - Brain, 2 - somatic growth, 3- ovary, 4 - Height
d)1- Brain, 2- waldeyer's ring, 3- somatic growth, 4- Testicular growth","The correct answer is 1- Brain, 2-  waldeyer's ring, 3- somatic growth, 4- Testicular growth.
curve 1: The neural growth(brain) attains 9o% of the growth by the age of 2 years.
curve 2: The tonsils are collections of lymphatic tissue located within the pharynx. They
collectively form a ringed arrangement, known as waldeyer’s ring. Tonsils/lymphatic growth in children occur between 4-8 years of age and then shrink down in adult age.
curve 3: somatic growth shows a sigmoid curve, rapid growth in the initial years, and then during puberty.
curve 4: Testicular growth/Gonadal growth starts during puberty, before that the curve is flat.",5761-3641.PNG,D,5767-3647.PNG
Q4,"A mother brought her 2-year-old child to the oPD with complaints of lack of weight gain,
abdominal pain on eating, and poor eating habits. The child was advised gluten-free diet after which there was improvement in the general condition and weight gain. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)Topical sprue
b)celiac disease
c)whipple's disease
d)Intestinal malabsorption","The clinical presentation and the histopathological findings are suggestive of celiac disease.
celiac disease is an autoimmune gluten-induced enteropathy where HLA DQ2 and DQ8 are
expressed. In the small intestine, peptides of gluten are presented to helper T cells which mediate mucosal inflammation. Antiendomysial and anti-tTG antibodies are found in serological studies.



Clinical Features:
• Gastrointestinal symptoms: Chronic diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss, and failure to thrive.
• Extraintestinal symptoms: Anemia, fatigue, elevated liver enzymes, neurologic disorders, short stature, dental enamel defects, arthralgia, aphthous stomatitis.
Investigation:
• serologic Tests: Initial testing for anti-TG2 IgA antibodies and total IgA. If anti-TG2 is positive and IgA levels are normal, CD is likely.
• Genetic Testing: For HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 haplotypes.
• Endoscopy and Biopsy: Multiple biopsies from the small intestine to check for villous atrophy.
• Biopsy Findings: villous atrophy: flattening of the villi in the small intestine, crypt hyperplasia:   enlargement of the crypts, intraepithelial lymphocytosis: Increased number of lymphocytes in the epithelium.
Treatment:
Gluten-Free Diet: To manage celiac disease, patients must strictly avoid all foods containing
gluten. safe alternatives include rice, corn, maize, buckwheat, millet, amaranth, quinoa, sorghum, potato, soybean, tapioca, and teff, along with bean and nut flours.
Biopsy findings can be seen below:


other options:
option A: Tropical sprue is another malabsorption disorder seen as diarrhoea, steatorrhea,
nutritional deficiencies, and weight loss. It is prevalent in some tropical areas hence the name. It   is mostly attributed to infectious agents considering its response to antibiotics. It is diagnosed by   a small intestinal biopsy which shows a close resemblance to that seen in celiac disease but it’s not specifically triggered by gluten and is more common in adults.
option C: whipple Disease is a multisystemic disease caused by T.whipplei. small intestinal biopsy shows PAs-positive macrophages.



option D: Intestinal Malabsorption is a general term used for conditions that cause poor nutrient absorption, which could include celiac disease but is not specific enough to explain the clear
response to a gluten-free diet.",5762-3643.PNG,B,5767-3647-1.png
Q5,Identify the condition shown in the image:,"a)chiari type 1
b)Dandy-walker malformation
c)vein of Galen malformation
d)corpus callosum agenesis","The MRI image in the question shows a downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, which is characteristic of chiari type 1 malformation.
This condition involves the herniation of the cerebellar tonsils into the spinal canal and is often
associated with headaches, neck pain, and sometimes neurological deficits. It may be identified on imaging, such as MRI, where the cerebellar tonsillar descent is clearly visualized.
Arnold chiari malformation is the most common malformation of the posterior fossa and hindbrain. There are two types of chiari malformations-
• chiari I malformation- It is the more common type. There is downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. It may be associated with syringomyelia.
• chiari II malformation: Displacement of the medulla, the fourth ventricle, and cerebellar vermis through the foramen magnum. It is almost always associated with a myelomeningocele.
other options:
option B: Dandy walker malformation is a developmental anomaly characterized by a cystic
dilation of the fourth ventricle, hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, an enlarged posterior fossa, and an upward displacement of the cerebellum. The atresia of the foramina of Magendie and
Luschka leads to obstructed cSF flow, resulting in non-communicating hydrocephalus, causing   symptoms such as vomiting, seizures, bulging fontanelles, and developmental delays. Diagnostic imaging includes ultrasound, cT, or MRI.
Given below is an image of Dandy walker malformation-




option C: The MR angiography in the vein of Galen malformation shows an enlarged midline
venous structure, with multiple arteriovenous communications leading to aneurysmal dilatation. The image below shows the malformation:


option D: Agenesis of the corpus callosum is one of the most common congenital cerebral
malformations which is morphologically the complete or partial absence of corpus callosum and not defined by functional or behavioral abnormalities. The given image shows the MRI findings:",5762-3642.PNG,A,5769-3648.PNG;5770-3650.PNG;5770-3649.PNG
Q6,"A newborn baby presented with a difficulty in breathing. Auscultation of the chest revealed gurgling sounds and heart sounds shifted to the right. The chest radiograph confirmed a
congenital diaphragmatic hernia. which among the following is the most common location for this condition?","a)Esophageal opening
b)Left posterolateral
c)Between sternum and coastal cartlage
d)central tendon","Congenital diaphragmatic hernia with the features given in the clinical vignette occurs most commonly in a left posterolateral defect.



Bochdalek hernia is the most common congenital diaphragmatic hernia which occurs on the left  posterolateral side due to a defect in the pleuroperitoneal membrane. The abdominal contents in the thorax compress the developing lungs causing pulmonary hypoplasia which manifests as
respiratory distress in most infants. Chest X-ray shows an indistinct diaphragm with radiolucent  para cardiac shadow and absent bowel loops in the abdomen. opacities can be seen in the thorax if solid organs or omentum also herniate. surgical repair is indicated in all cases either by a
thoracic or abdominal approach.
Given below is an X-ray showing Bochdalek's hernia


other options:
option A- sliding and rolling hernias occur via the oesophagal opening(hiatal hernia). sliding hernia (more common) occurs when the gastroesophageal junction(GEJ) and a part of the
stomach slide up into the thorax via the opening. A rolling hernia occurs when the GEJ stays   below the diaphragm, but the stomach goes up, lying parallel to the oesophagus in the thorax. Hiatal hernias occur in adults.
option C- The space between the sternum and costal cartilage is called the space of Larry or space of Morgagni. A defect in this space causes Morgagni hernia, which is the second most common
hernia in children. It occurs on the right anteromedial aspect and is often less symptomatic.
The following is an X-ray showing Morgagni's Hernia :





option D- A defect in the central tendon causes a central congenital diaphragmatic hernia.",,B,5770-3650-1.png;5772-3651.PNG;5770-3650-2.png
Q7,"A child presented with failure to thrive and recurrent infections. on examination, tonsils are   absent. Further evaluation confirms the deficiency of adenosine deaminase. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Lesch-Nyhan syndrome
b)Ataxia telengeictasia
c)severe combined Immuno Deficiency
d)Friedrich's ataxia","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to a deficiency of adenosine deaminase.
Affected children present with prominent thrush (oral candidiasis), extensive diaper rash, and
failure to thrive. Some patients develop a morbilliform rash shortly after birth because maternal T cells are transferred across the placenta and attack the fetus, causing graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD).
persons with SCID are extremely susceptible to recurrent, severe infections by a wide range of pathogens, including:



• Candida albicans
• pneumocystis jiroveci
• pseudomonas
• Cytomegalovirus
• varicella
The thymus biopsy shows remnants of Hassall's corpuscles, indicating severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID) due to adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. SCID affects both
humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, primarily impacting T cells and resulting in the absence or severe underdevelopment of lymphoid tissues like lymph nodes and tonsils.
There are two main types of SCID:
• X-linked SCID: The most common form, caused by a mutation in the common γ-chain (γc) subunit of cytokine receptors. This leads to reduced T-cell numbers and impaired antibody  synthesis despite normal B-cell counts. The thymus shows undifferentiated epithelial cells.
• Autosomal recessive SCID: often due to ADA deficiency, causing toxic metabolite accumulation that damages T cells, resulting in greater T-cell reduction.
In both forms, the thymus is small and lacks lymphoid cells, but ADA deficiency uniquely features remnants of Hassall’s corpuscles.
Note: X-linked SCID is the first human disease in which gene therapy has been successful.
other options:
option A: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is due to a deficiency of the enzyme Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase(HGpRT). It is an X-linked recessive disease. The clinical features    include intellectual disability, self-mutilation, aggression, hyperuricemia, and gout.
option B: Ataxia Telangiectasia is a progressive neurodegenerative genetic disease causing poor    coordination and small dilated blood vessels. It is autosomal recessive in inheritance due to ATM gene mutation on Ch 11q22-23.
option D: Friedrich's ataxia involves the posterior column, pyramidal, and spinocerebellar tracts. Clinical features include cardiomyopathy, optic atrophy, and diabetes mellitus. It should be
differentiated from other forms of ataxia as Tabes dorsalis and SACD(Subacute Combined Degeneration).",,C,
Q8,A child presented with diarrhea and dehydration. There was no blood in the stools. A stool examination revealed a spoke wheel pattern. Identify the causative organism.,"a)Adenovirus
b)E.coli
c)Norwalk virus
d)Rota virus","The given clinical scenario along with the electron micrograph image of the stool sample showing a spoke wheel pattern with complaints of non-bloody diarrhea and dehydration in a child is
suggestive of rotavirus.
Rotavirus is a nonenveloped, double-stranded (ds) RNA virus. Rotaviruses appear
as cartwheel-shaped structures with short spokes radiating from them. It has 11 segments of double-stranded RNA. They exhibit genetic reassortment due to the presence of
this segmented RNA.





Rotavirus is the most common identifiable viral cause of diarrhea in children below the age of 5  years and is most frequent between 6-24 months of age. The incubation period is 1-3 days. Most cases are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms like watery diarrhea, vomiting, low-grade
fever, and temporary lactose intolerance. Diagnosis can be made by rapid antigen detection of rotavirus in stool specimens.
Rotavirus vaccine is associated with a potential risk of intussusception, especially when the first dose of these vaccines is given to infants aged &gt;12 weeks. Because of this risk, the rotavirus    vaccine is not a part of catch-up immunization programs.
symptoms associated with different levels of dehydration are classified into 3 types no/minimal dehydration, mild to moderate dehydration, and severe dehydration.
other options:
option A: Adenovirus contains double-stranded DNA. They have an icosahedral symmetry with
structures known as fibers extruding from the vertices. They have a space vehicle-shaped appearance.






option B: E coli are motile, facultative anaerobes in GIT. It is a gram-negative, flagellated rod. It is the most frequent cause of acute complicated urinary tract infections. It is a lactose fermenter  and hence, grows on Macconkey medium to produce pink colonies.


option c: Norwalk virus is a small, round, non-enveloped virion with a single-stranded
positive-sense RNA genome with icosahedral symmetry. when viewed under an electron
microscope, it has a cup-shaped morphology. clinical features include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea.",5764-3644.PNG,D,5774-3653.PNG;5774-3652.PNG;5775-3655.PNG;5775-3654.PNG
