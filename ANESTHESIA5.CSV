Q1,what is the mechanism of action of the curare group of muscle relaxants?,"a)persistently depolarizing at neuromuscular junction
b)competitively blocking the binding of Ach to its receptors
c)Repetitive stimulation of Ach receptors on muscle endplate
d)Inhibiting the calcium channels on presynaptic membrane","The curare group of drugs includes non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents that act by competitively blocking the binding of acetylcholine to its receptors.
This leads to a decrease in the effect of acetylcholine and thus, neuronal transmission to the muscle does not occur.",,B,
Q2,which of the following nerves is popularly used in clinical anaesthesia to monitor neuromuscular blockade?,"a)ulnar Nerve
b)Median Nerve
c)Radial nerve
d)Mandibular nerve","ulnar nerve stimulation at wrist is popularly used to assess the adequacy of neuromuscular blockade.
Neuromuscular blockade is measured using a peripheral nerve stimulator.

Nerve	Response
ulnar nerve	contraction of adductor polli cis




Nerve	Response
Facial nerve	contraction of orbicularis oc uli
posterior tibial nerve	contraction of flexor hallucis brevis",,A,
Q3,Identify the Mallampatti class of this patient.,"a)class II
b)class I
c)class IV
d)class III","The image shows Mallampatti class II airway.
The modified Mallampatti classification is used in the assessment of airway. It is a predictor of the difficulty of intubation or difficult airway.
The assessment is performed with the patient sitting up straight, mouth open and tongue maximally protruded, without saying ""ahh.""
Modified Mallampati classification:
• class o: Ability to see any part of the epiglottis.
• class I: soft palate, fauces, uvula visible.
• class II: soft palate and fauces seen, tip of uvula not visible.
• class III: soft palate, base of uvula visible.
• class IV: soft palate not visible at all. only hard palate visible.


classes 3 and 4 are difficult intubation situations.
Initially, the Mallampatti scoring system (1985) had only 3 classes. This was modified by samsoon and young to include class 4. Later class o was also added.",3430-2146.PNG,A,3433-2147.PNG;3434-2149.PNG
Q4,In which of the following devices is Murphy's eye seen?,"a)Nasopharyngeal airway
b)Laryngoscope
c)Bronchoscope
d)Endotracheal tube","Murphy's eye is seen in the endotracheal tube (ETT).
Murphy's eye refers to the distal opening in the side wall of the ETT.
If the distal end of the lumen of the tube is blocked by secretions, Murphy's eye serves to provide an alternate route for ventilation.",,D,3434-2148.PNG
Q5,what is the most effective circuit for anaesthesia under spontaneous breathing?,"a)Mapleson A
b)Mapleson B
c)Mapleson c
d)Mapleson D","The most effective circuit for anesthesia under spontaneous breathing is Mapleson A or Magill's circuit.



when the Mapleson A circuit is used for spontaneous ventilation, the fresh gas flow rate of the   circuit is closest to the physiological minute ventilation of the patient. Hence it is preferred over other circuits.",,A,
Q6,The best type of anesthesia for pre eclampsia is:,"a)spinal anesthesia
b)Epidural anesthesia
c)General anesthesia
d)caudal block","continuous epidural anesthesia is the first choice for most patients with preeclampsia during labor, vaginal delivery, and cesarean section.
pre-eclampsia patients have a risk of severe airway edema, which makes intubation difficult. Thus continuous epidural anesthesia is advantageous as it avoids the need for intubation. Besides,
continuous epidural anesthesia can improve uteroplacental perfusion and also decrease
catecholamine secretion.
But one major prerequisite for regional anesthesia in preeclamptic patients is normal platelet count and normal coagulation. coagulopathy is a contraindication for regional anesthesia.
Minimal platelet count for regional anesthesia is 1oo,ooo/μL, but some cases can be taken up with a platelet count as low as 7o,ooo/μL.
General anesthesia is indicated in patients with coagulopathy and in severe pre-eclampsia with complications.
spinal anesthesia can be given in mild pre-eclampsia but hypotension associated with spinal anesthesia limits its use in moderate to severe pre-eclampsia.
since the severity of pre-eclampsia or the type of delivery (vaginal or cesarean) is not mentioned, epidural anesthesia has an advantage over other techniques for above-mentioned reasons. Hence the best option here would be epidural anesthesia.",,B,
Q7,what alternative drug would you use for cardiac arrest if epinephrine is not effective?,"a)vasopressin
b)Atropine
c)Amiodarone
d)Adenosine","Epinephrine and amiodarone are the two main drugs approved by the AHA for the resuscitation of a cardiac arrest patient.
The first dose of epinephrine 1 mg IV is administered after the 2nd defibrillator shock is delivered and it is continued every 3-5 minutes.
If this is not effective, 3oo mg IV bolus dose of amiodarone can be given and another dose of 15o mg given if necessary",,C,
