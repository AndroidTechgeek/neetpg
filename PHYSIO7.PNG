"Q1","A person develops headache and breathlessness on a trekking expedition following rapid ascent to over 3ooo metres above the sea level. which of the following is not used in the treatment of this condition?","a) IV digoxin
b) Descent to lower altitude
c) Administration of oxygen
d) Tablet acetazolamide","The symptoms of headache and breathlessness following rapid ascent indicate acute mountain/altitude sickness and IV digoxin is not used to treat this condition.
on ascent to high altitudes, the low partial pressure of oxygen leads to hypoxia and systemic arteriolar dilatation. Consequently, the capillary pressure rises with increased transudation of fluid into the brain tissue.
Treatment involves administration of oxygen, descent to a lower altitude and administration of acetazolamide. Acetazolamide counteracts hypoxia by stimulating respiration and also reduces the formation of cerebrospinal fluid, thereby reducing intracranial tension.","","A",""
"Q2","V/Q = infinity holds true in which of the following conditions?","a) Foreign body obstruction in the bronchus
b) Equal to dead space
c) when o2 and Co2 ratio is equal
d) The Po2 of alveolar air is 159 mmHg and PCo2 is 4o mmHg","VA /Q= infinity means that there is no exchange of o2 & Co2, which means the volume of the lung equals to dead space and the physiological effort of breathing is wasted.
VA represents the ventilation in alveoli and Q represents the blood flow through the alveolus. The ratio of VA and Q explains the respiratory exchange when there is an imbalance between alveolar ventilation and alveolar blood flow.
VA /Q ratio is infinity when:
• There is adequate ventilation but no perfusion.
• No exchange of gases ( o2 and Co2 )through the respiratory membranes of corresponding alveoli.
• The alveolar air equilibrates the humidified inspired air.","","B",""
"Q3","Prolactin level is highest during :","a) 24 hours after ovulation
b) 24 hours after delivery
c) REM Sleep
d) After running for 1 hour","Among the given options, the prolactin level is highest 24 hours after delivery.
The maximum level of prolactin is seen during pregnancy and in the immediate postpartum period. During pregnancy, the secretion is increased reaching a peak at the time of delivery. After delivery, the plasma concentration falls to nonpregnant levels in a few weeks. suckling produces surges of prolactin release.","","B",""
"Q4","C wave of JVP represents:","a) Tricuspid bulge into right atrium during isovolumetric ventricular contraction
b) Contraction of right atrium
c) passive filling of right atrium
d) passive emptying of right atrium","'c' wave in JVP represents tricuspid bulge into right atrium during isovolumetric ventricular contraction.
characteristics of JVP :
• a wave corresponds to atrial systole.
• c wave occurs due to the increase in atrial pressure caused by bulging of the tricuspid valve into the right atrium during isovolumetric ventricular contraction.
• x descent occurs due to the fall in atrial pressure during ventricular systole.
• v wave is seen at the end of ventricular contraction and occurs due to the slow venous filling.
• y descent occurs due to the passive emptying of the right atrium into the right ventricle.","","A",""
"Q5","The protein in the glomerular basement membrane responsible for charge-dependent filtration is?","a) Fibronectin
b) Heparan sulfate
c) collagen Type IV
d) Entactin","The protein in the glomerular basement membrane responsible for charge-dependent filtration is heparan sulfate. It prevents filtration by repelling negatively charged proteins.
Collagen type IV, fibronectin, entactin are structural components of basement membrane.","","B",""
"Q6","which of the following clotting factors would have decreased gamma carboxyglutamate residue in a patient on warfarin therapy?","a) Factor 2
b) Factor 11
c) Tissue factor
d) Factor 5","Factor 2 would have decreased gamma carboxyglutamate residue in a patient on warfarin therapy.
Activation of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, X is done by carboxylation of their glutamate residues. This is done by the enzyme γ-glutamyl carboxylase with the reduced form of vitamin K as a co-factor.
This recycling is done by the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase. This enzyme is inhibited by warfarin.
Hence, warfarin indirectly inhibits the γ-carboxylation of vitamin K dependent clotting factors - Factors II, VII, IX, X.","","A",""
"Q7","which of the following conditions would have the highest levels ofAcTH and cortisol?","a) Early morning
b) Normal individuals with dexamethasone administration
c) Addison's disease
d) cushing's disease","Among the given conditions, the levels ofACTH and cortisol will be highest in Cushing's disease.
Cushing’s disease is caused by an ACTH secreting pituitary adenoma. The increased ACTH causes increased cortisol production.
Note: In normal physiologic state, ACTH levels are higher in the early morning but not as high as in Cushing's disease.","","D",""
"Q8","Following complete ileal and partial jejunal resection, the patient is most likely to have","a) Folic acid deficiency
b) vitamin B12 deficiency
c) Gastric ulcer
d) constipation","After complete ileal and partial jejunal resection, the patient is likely to have vitamin B12 deficiency.
vitamin B12 is absorbed in the ileum. vitamin B12 binds to intrinsic factor, a protein secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach, and the complex is absorbed across the ileal mucosa. Hence after ileal resection, there is impaired absorption of vitamin B12.","","B",""
"Q9","Respiratory distress syndrome is due to defective","a) Type 1 pneumocytes
b) Type 2 pneumocytes
c) Alveolar capillary endothelial cells
d) Bronchial mucosal epithelial cells","Respiratory distress syndrome is due to defective type 2 pneumocytes which produce lung surfactants. The surfactants reduce the surface tension in the alveoli. A defect in type 2 pneumocytes or surfactant deficiency can lead to respiratory distress syndrome.
The primary alveoli develop and the production of the surfactant begins by week 2o-24. However, it does not reach the lungs until later. The surfactant appears in the amniotic fluid between 28 and 32 weeks of gestation. Mature levels of the pulmonary surfactant are present usually after 35 weeks of gestation.","","B",""

"Q11","what is the site of lesion in wernicke's hemianopic pupil?","a) optic nerve
b) optic tract
c) optic radiation
d) optic chiasma","The site of lesion in wernicke's hemianopic pupil is optic tract.
wernicke hemianopic pupil is the light reflex, where, illumination of the blind half of the retina shows no pupillary reaction while stimulating the normal side of the retina shows a pupillary reaction. It is seen in lesions involving the optic tract. It is also seen in cases such as TB, syphilis and tumours of the optic thalamus.
Homonymous hemianopia (HH) involves loss of vision on the same side of the visual field in both eyes. HH is characteristically seen in lesions involving the visual pathway posterior to the optic chiasma.","","B",""
"Q12","In which of the following reflexes, gastric emptying is delayed when acidic content enters the duodenum?","a) Gastrocolic
b) Enterocolic
c) Gastroileal
d) Enterogastric","In the enterogastric reflex, gastric emptying is delayed when acidic content enters the duodenum.
when the food enters the duodenum, multiple reflexes are initiated from the duodenal wall which passes back to the stomach. These reflexes slow or stop the stomach emptying if the volume of the chyme in the duodenum becomes too much. These reflexes are called enterogastric reflexes.
This reflex can be triggered due to: presence of irritants and acids in duodenal chyme, distension of duodenum, rapid entry of hypertonic or hypotonic fluids, presence of breakdown products of protein digestion and sometimes fat.","","D",""
"Q13","A lady presents with vascular injury to the inferior frontal gyrus. which functional area is likely to be affected?","a) Motor speech area
b) wernicke's area
c) Auditory area
d) visual area","Broca's motor speech area is likely to be affected in the vascular injury of the inferior frontal gyrus. A lesion in this region leads to motor/Broca's aphasia. speech is non-fluent and interrupted by many word-finding pauses. The speech is impoverished in function words that contribute to the syntax but is enriched in meaningful nouns and verbs. However, comprehension of speech is intact and the patient knows what he wants to say.
For example, a patient with Broca's aphasia may say ""walk dog"" instead of ""I want to take the dog for a walk"".","","A",""
"Q14","A man falls into a deep sleep with one arm under his head. He finds he is not able to move this arm when he awakens. However, it tingles and pain sensation in the arm is still intact. what is the reason for the loss of motor function without loss of pain sensation is that in the nerves to his arm?","a) B fibers are more susceptible to pressure than A fibers
b) A fibers are more sensitive to pressure than C fibers
c) C fibers are more sensitive to pressure than A fibers
d) Motor nerves are more affected by sleep than sensory nerves","The reason for the loss of motor function without loss of pain sensation is that in the nerves to his arm, A-fibers are more sensitive to pressure than C fibers.
sleeping for a long period with the arms under the head puts pressure on a nerve. It leads to the loss of conduction in large-diameter motor, touch, and pressure fibers, while pain sensation remains relatively intact. A-fibers (includes the motor fibers) are affected.
The susceptibility of the nerve fibers to pressure is A>B>C.
This is responsible for saturday night or sunday morning paralysis.","","B",""
"Q15","which of the following has the highest oxygen concentration in fetal circulation?","a) Inferior vena cava
b) Right atrium
c) superior vena cava
d) Ascending aorta","Inferior vena cava has the highest oxygen concentration in fetal circulation.
The blood gets oxygenated in the placenta and this passes to the umbilical vein. From the umbilical vein, 5o% of the blood enters the hepatic circulation and 5o% bypasses the liver to enter the inferior vena cava. From here, the blood enters the heart via the right atrium. The right atrium also receives deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava. This mixed blood is distributed to the body via aorta.
Therefore, inferior vena cava has the highest concentration of oxygen in the fetal circulation.","","A",""
"Q16","Respiratory distress syndrome is due to the deficiency of","a) Dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine
b) phosphatidylserine
c) phosphatidylethanolamine
d) phosphatidylinositol","Respiratory distress syndrome is due to the deficiency of dipalmitoyl-phosphatidyl-choline(DPPC) /dipalmitoyl lecithin. It is the major pulmonary surfactant.
Clinical relevance- Test to assess fetal lung maturity is L/s ratio - lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio. A ratio of ≥ 2 is considered normal.","","A",""
"Q17","what makes CpDA superior than ACD for blood storage:","a) The fall in 2, 3 DpG is less
b) Decreased release of o2
c) It has less p5o
d) It is less acidic","The fall in 2, 3 DPG is less when the blood is stored in CPDA compared with ACD.
2, 3 DPG (2,3-diphosphoglycerate) binds to deoxygenated haemoglobin. Therefore, an increase in 2,3 DPG causes increased release of o2 to the tissues.
In stored blood, the 2,3 DPG levels usually fall. As a result, stored blood releases less oxygen to the tissues.
However, such a fall in 2,3 DPG is less when it is stored in a phosphate-containing solution like CPDA (Citrate, phosphate, dextrose, adenine), rather than ACD (Acid citrate dextrose). Therefore, the blood stored in CPDA, in comparison with blood stored in ACD has:
• Higher 2,3 DPG concentration
• Increased release of oxygen to the tissues.
• Raised P5o (Po2 at which Hb is half saturated)","","A",""
