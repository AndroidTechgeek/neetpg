Q1,what could be the diagnosis of a woman with this appearance on x-ray?,"a)Multiple brown tumors
b)Fibrous dysplasia
c)Multiple enchondromas
d)Multiple exostoses","The diagnosis of the woman is multiple enchondromas. The X-ray shows multiple calcified lesions in the fingers.
Multiple enchondromatosis is also known as ollier disease. It is a tumor in the metaphysis of long bones. There is a failure of bone formation and broadening of unossified cartilage within the bone. This results in shortening and angular deformity of the affected bones with an increased risk of
pathological fractures. Enchondromas are also known as Maffucci syndrome if it is associated with overlying soft tissue hemangiomas. 25% of the patients with ollier's disease will develop sarcomas by 4o years of age.
X-ray shows intralesional calcifications with a popcorn appearance. Histologically, enchondromas consist of hyaline cartilage with cytologically benign chondrocytes. Treatment of multiple
enchondromas includes correction by osteotomy if the deformities are obvious.
Given below is an X-ray showing calcifications:











other options:
option A: Multiple brown tumors are caused secondary to hyperparathyroidism and resemble a  giant-cell tumor. It can be diagnosed by estimating the levels of calcium, alkaline phosphatase,   and parathyroid hormone levels. The bone surrounding the lesion shows peritrabecular fibrosis.
The image below shows a brown tumor on the left hand:


option B: Fibrous dysplasia is a condition characterized by the replacement of bone with fibrous    tissue. The X-ray shows a ground-glass appearance with a well-defined sclerotic rim. It is seen in    association with Mccune-Albright syndrome. shepherd’s crook deformity in the proximal femur is characteristic of fibrous dysplasia.
The image below shows a child with Mccune-Albright syndrome:






option D: Multiple exostoses is an autosomal dominant type of osteochondroma that affects the phalanx, scaphoid, and metacarpals. The X-ray shows bony erosions and is excised.
The image below shows exostoses at the base of the thumb:",5410-3445.PNG,C,5415-3452.PNG;5415-3451.PNG;5415-3450.PNG;5416-3454.PNG;5416-3453.PNG;5417-3456.PNG;5417-3455.PNG
Q2,which of the following is true about the type of fixation shown in the image?,"a)Fracture tibia, Illizarow fixator
b)Fracture tibia, spanning fixator
c)Fracture femur, spanning fixator
d)periarticular fracture of knee, spanning fixator","The image shows a periarticular fracture of the knee and a spanning external fixator used to stabilize the fracture.
External fixators are used if the fracture is associated with severe soft tissue damage. It is also    used if internal fixation is risky due to wound contamination. The spanning external fixator will stabilize the fracture until the condition of soft tissue improves.



The technique of an external fixator is that the bone will be fixed above and below the fractures with screws and wires. These screws and wires are then connected to rigid bars. This method is used in fractures of the tibia, femur, pelvis, bones of the hand, etc.
In the image, the bones above and below the knee joint are fixed using a spanning external fixator and hence the fracture is likely to be a periarticular fracture of the knee.
The complications of external fixation include over-distraction, damage to soft tissue structures, and pin-track infections.
Another external fixator that is commonly used in an open type of fracture is the Ilizarov
fixator. It is also used for the reconstruction of the limbs and for emergency stabilization in multiple long bone fractures.",5411-3446.PNG,D,5418-3457.PNG
Q3,"A male patient presented with a bone fracture following a road traffic accident. After 2 days he developed dyspnea, petechiae involving the whole body, and a fall in oxygen saturation.  what is the likely diagnosis?","a)Fat embolism
b)Air embolism
c)venous thromboembolism
d)pulmonary hypertension","The likely diagnosis is fat embolism.
Fat embolism is caused by the fat globules originating from the bone marrow following fracture of long bones. clinical features of fat embolism are usually seen within 72 hours. They
include tachycardia, fever, breathlessness, petechiae, confusion, and restlessness.
There is no specific test for diagnosis. However, urine analysis to look for fat globules and    monitoring of blood po2 are done. Management offat embolism is mostly supportive, with oxygen therapy.
other options:
option B: Air embolism occurs when air bubbles entering the pulmonary circulation get absorbed in large quantities. severe hypotension and hypoxemia are seen in this condition. The patient is    placed in Trendelenburg's left lateral decubitus position.
option c: Venous thromboembolism consists of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein      thrombosis (DVT). Bedridden patients and patients with chronic systemic diseases are more prone to thromboembolism. clinical features of PE include dyspnea, syncope, cyanosis,



hypotension etc. DVT is presented as leg cramps, erythema, and tenderness. Heparin, LMWH, or fondaparinux are used for the treatment.
option D: pulmonary hypertension is a disease that involves remodeling of the pulmonary
vasculature. It results in increased pulmonary artery pressure and vascular resistance. It mainly occurs as a complication of left heart disease, other primary lung diseases, and pulmonary
embolism. The clinical features include dyspnea, edema, chest pain, syncope, etc.",,A,5418-3457-1.png
Q4,An intrauterine scan at the 13th week of pregnancy showed a fetus with multiple long bone fractures. what is commonly associated with this finding?,"a)Achondroplasia
b)osteogenesis imperfecta
c)cretinism
d)Marfan syndrome","osteogenesis imperfecta is commonly associated with this multiple long bone fractures.
osteogenesis imperfecta is a connective tissue disorder that occurs due to abnormal type 1
collagen production. The main features are joints that are vulnerable to fracture, scleral
alterations, dentinogenesis imperfecta, and deafness. Multiple bone fractures are a consequence  of bone fragility. It is classified into four types based on scleral involvement, natural history, and mode of inheritance.
protrusio acetabuli, wormian bones, and proximal femoral ‘shepherd’s crook’ deformities of the
femurs are the common radiological findings that are observed. Management comprises the use of bisphosphonates, along with physiotherapy and walking aids.
The images below show blue sclera and wormian bones in osteogenesis imperfecta:






other options:
option A: Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia with disproportionately
short limbs, sleep apnea, and kyphoscoliosis. Facial features include button nose, frontal bossing, macrocephaly, etc.
The images below show the features of achondroplasia:
(a) prominent forehead and body asymmetry, (b) a low nasal bridge, (c) trident hands, (d) scoliosis





option c: cretinism occurs due to iodine deficiency. Its clinical features are deaf-mutism, squint, mental retardation, and spastic or rigid neuromotor disorder.
option D: Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder. The affected persons will be tall   with long limbs and digits. spontaneous pneumothorax, aortic dissection, and lens dislocation are also seen. An early diastolic murmur is heard on auscultation.",,B,5420-3459.PNG;5420-3458.PNG;5421-3460.PNG
Q5,"what is the most common complication of this condition, if left untreated?","a)Malunion and stiffness
b)Non union and cubitus varus
c)cubitus valgus
d)Myositis ossificans","cubitus valgus is the most common complication, as the given condition is untreated lateral condyle of humerus fracture.
5–15 degrees of valgus is the normal carrying angle of the elbow. An angle more than this or an asymmetry between the two sides is called a valgus deformity. Long-standing non-union of a
fractured lateral condyle is considered the most common cause.
Features of ulnar nerve palsy, such as the weakness of the hand, numbness or tingling of the ulnar fingers are also seen with cubitus valgus
Lateral condyle of humerus fracture is seen mostly in children up to 16 years of age. Falling on the hand with an extended elbow is the mechanism of injury. It is classified into types 1 and 2: the
fracture is lateral to the trochlea in type 1 and through the middle, in type 2.
A back slab with the elbow flexed 9o degrees is used if there is no displacement. Reduction and internal fixation are needed for a displaced fracture.
Recurrent dislocations and malunion are the other complications. since it is a salter-Harris type IV injury, an imperfect reduction can result in growth arrest.
The image below shows cubitus valgus deformity:





other options:
option B: cubitus varus deformity is also called gunstock deformity. It happens due to
the malunion of supracondylar fracture in childhood. Injury to the brachial artery is an important complication.


option D: Myositis ossificans is a tender swelling seen in the area of injury. It is often confused as a malignant tumor. calcified lesions are seen in radiological studies. However, the swelling soon    becomes less painful.
The X-ray image below shows myositis ossificans:",5412-3447.PNG,C,5399-3437.PNG;5248-3298.PNG;5423-3461.PNG
Q6,A child with a history of recurrent respiratory infections presented with complaints of pain   around the knee and a high fever. X-ray shows lytic and sclerotic bone. His peripheral blood smear is shown in the image below. Aspirate from the joint will most likely show:,"a)staphylococcus aureus
b)Escherichia coli
c)salmonella
d)streptococcus","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of acute osteomyelitis. Aspirate from the joint will most likely show salmonella.
The peripheral smear picture is indicative of sickle cell anemia. patients with sickle cell anemia are prone to acute osteomyelitis caused by salmonella.
sickle cell anemia is a hematological disease caused by a mixture of genotypes. Its complication includes acute painful episodes, priapism, stroke, leg ulcers, acute chest syndrome
(pneumonia-like illness with fever, cough, and hypoxia), etc.
Acute osteomyelitis refers to infection of the bone. It is mainly seen in
children. staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism causing osteomyelitis. However, in patients with sickle cell anemia, it is usually caused by salmonella. Hemophilus influenza, E.  coli, streptococcus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa can also cause the disease. The spread can be through hematogenous route or from exogenous routes such as open fractures, iatrogenic
intervention, or spread from local infection.





Cardinal features of acute osteomyelitis in children include:
• Fever
• pain
• Difficulty in weight-bearing
• Elevated WBC count
• Elevated CRp
• Elevated EsR
X-ray shows periosteal reaction and bony destruction after 1o-12 days of infection. Management includes blood culture and sensitivity tests, followed by immediate empirical antibiotic
therapy. surgical drainage is done if there is an abscess or when the patient does not respond to antibiotics.
The complications of inadequately treated acute osteomyelitis include:
• septicemia
• Epiphyseal damage and altered bone growth
• Chronic osteomyelitis
• suppurative arthritis
• pathological fracture",5413-3449.PNG,C,5424-3462.PNG
Q7,A boy falls on the left shoulder joint and presents to the emergency department with shoulder pain. His left elbow is flexed and is supported by the right hand. which bone might be most    likely fractured?,"a)1
b)2
c)3
d)4","The clavicle marked as 1 might be most likely fractured.
one of the most frequently fractured bones in the body is the clavicle. Mostly, it occurs due to a direct blow or a fall on an outstretched arm. The midshaft of the clavicle is most commonly
fractured. The lateral fragment is pulled down by the weight of the arm and the medial half is



pulled up by the sternomastoid muscle.


The patient will be presented with the flexed elbow as the arm will be held to the chest to prevent movement. It is divided into three groups, based on the location of the fractures.
• Group I – middle-third fractures
• Group II – lateral-third fractures
• Group III – medial-third fractures
undisplaced fractures will be mostly treated non-operatively, with a simple sling for comfort. It can be used for 2-3 weeks and discarded once the pain subsides. Displaced fractures are treated with internal fixation either by contoured locking plates or intramedullary nails.


complications include non-union, malunion, and stiffness of the shoulder. other options:



option B: scapula is marked as '2'. Fracture of the scapula occurs as a result of blunt trauma, falls, seizures, etc. The arm will be held immobile and bruising can be seen over the scapula and chest    wall.
option C: The shaft of the humerus is marked as '3'. Fracture of the shaft of the humerus occurs as a result of a fall on the hand, elbow, direct blow to the arm, or metastasis. The arm will be
painful, bruised and swollen.
option D: The 4th rib is marked as '4'. Rib fracture occurs due to the impact on the chest wall.
Multiple rib fractures will result in the loss of structural integrity of the chest wall and cause flail chest. The lung cannot inflate as the flail segment is sucked in during inspiration.",5413-3448.PNG,A,5425-3464.PNG;5425-3463.PNG
