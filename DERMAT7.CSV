b)Anti-tubercular therapy
c)Topical steroids therapy
d)Anti-leprosy treatment","The given image shows an annular plaque with central scarring points to lupus vulgaris, which is treated using anti-tubercular drugs.
It is the most common cutaneous tuberculosis in India. The characteristic lesions are annular,    infiltrated plaques with serpiginous edges, central atrophy and scarring and are commonly seen on face, buttocks and extremities.
on diascopy, apple jelly nodules are seen.


Histologically, tubercles are seen in the superficial dermis showing scanty or absent central caseation with surrounding epithelioid histiocytes and giant cells.
other differential diagnoses for annular plaque include:
• Tinea corporis shows central clearing, peripherally raised scaly margins and presents with an itch.





• cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions have central crusting and are seen on the face in patients from areas of high leishmaniasis prevalence.",3602-2273.PNG,B,3605-2277.PNG;3606-2279.PNG;3606-2278.PNG
Q2,Identify the finding associated with the condition shown in the image below.,"a)Isomorphic phenomenon
b)Meyerson phenomenon
c)Gottron's papule
d)Nikolsky's sign","The image shows plaque psoriasis of the dorsum of the hand, and isomorphic or koebner phenomenon is associated with the condition.
option B: Meyerson phenomenon refers to the formation of an eczematous ring around a melanocytic nevus.





option C: Gottron's papules are violaceous, erythematous papules overlying the dorsal interphalangeal or metacarpophalangeal, elbow, or knee joints.


option D: Nikolsky sign refers to easy peeling of skin on applying tangential pressure over a bony prominence and is classically seen in pemphigus and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome.",3603-2275.PNG,A,3607-2281.PNG;3607-2280.PNG;3608-2283.PNG

b)Herpangina
c)Molluscum contagiosum
d)Impetigo","The above image shows multiple vesicles &amp; crusts clustered on an inflamed base around the lips which is characteristic of herpes labialis or cold sore.
It is commonly caused by herpes simplex virus type 1(HSV-1) and rarely by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). It begins with a prodrome of pain, burning, and tingling followed by the
appearance of erythematous papules. The papules then become vesicular and may ulcerate.
It is treated with oral acyclovir 2oo mg and 5% topical acyclovir.
option B: Herpangina or vesicular pharyngitis is characterized by the presence of ulcerating small vesicles on the oral fauces and the posterior pharyngeal wall. It is commonly caused by the
coxsackie virus.




option C: Molluscum contagiosum is characterized by pearly white, wart-like umbilicated papules. It is caused by the pox virus.


option D: Impetigo is characterized by golden yellow or honey-coloured crusts that form after the rupture of pustulating vesicles. Non-bullous impetigo is caused by both S. aureus and
streptococcus. Bullous impetigo is caused by S. aureus.",3603-2274.PNG,A,3608-2282.PNG;3609-2285.PNG;3609-2284.PNG

c)ciclopirox olamine

options B and D: oxiconazole and tioconazole are classified as imidazoles
option C: Ciclopirox olamine is a hydroxypyridone compound.",,A,3610-2286.PNG
Q5,"A child was born with membranes around the body and had ectropion and eclabium. He is brought to the OPD with lesions covering his face, trunk, and extremities. which of the
following is an unlikely diagnosis?","a)Ichthyosis vulgaris
b)Lamellar ichthyosis
c)Bathing suit ichthyosis
d)Harlequin ichthyosis","The clinical picture shows a neonate encased in a shiny, parchment-like membrane (collodion baby) suggestive of a disorder belonging to the autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis
spectrum.
Ichthyosis vulgaris is not a part of this disease spectrum. It does not present at birth and is therefore an unlikely diagnosis.
Ichthyosis vulgaris is an autosomal dominant condition caused due to a mutation in the filaggrin gene (FLG). It develops in the first few months of life. patients exhibit accentuated palmar and     plantar creases and have dry scaly skin. The scales appear light grey and cover the extensor
surfaces of the limbs and the trunk. It usually spares the groin and larger
flexures. Immunohistochemistry reveals an absent or markedly reduced filaggrin signal.
Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis spectrum includes the following:
• Harlequin ichthyosis (HI)
• Bathing suit ichthyosis (BSI)
• Lamellar ichthyosis (LI)
• Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (CIE)
• Self- improving congenital ichthyosis (SICI)
• Transient manifestations, such as collodion baby.",3604-2276.PNG,A,
