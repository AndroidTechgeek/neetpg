Q1,The remnants of wolffian ducts in females are located in________.,"a)Pouch of Douglas
b)Leaves of broad ligament
c)uterovesical pouch
d)Iliac fossa","The Gartner's duct is a remnant of the wolffian ducts in women. These are located in the broad ligament and the vagina.
The Gartner's duct is an embryological remnant of the mesonephric duct/wolffian duct formed
during the development of the urinary and reproductive organs. It runs parallel to, but below, the fallopian tube in the mesosalpinx. The duct passes downwards by the side of the uterus to the
level of the internal os where it passes into the tissues of the cervix. It then runs forwards to reach the anterolateral aspect of the vaginal wall and may reach as far down as the hymen.
The duct can sometimes form a cyst in the broad ligament or in the vagina. It is called Gartner’s cyst. It is a benign condition and can be treated with marsupialization.",,B,5963-3737.PNG
Q2,In which part of the fallopian tube does fertilization occur?,"a)Ampulla
b)Isthmus
c)Interstitial
d)Infundibular","Fertilization usually occurs in the ampulla of the fallopian tube.
During ovulation, the ovum is released and it enters the fallopian tube. It is propelled towards the uterine cavity by the peristaltic action of the fallopian tubes, prostaglandins in the male seminal     fluid and oxytocin. It can only be fertilized within 24 hours of ovulation.  If coitus takes place
during this period, the spermatozoa swimming up into the tubes meet the ovum in the ampulla.",,A,
Q3,"A patient came to the gynaecology OPD with complaints of foul-smelling frothy vaginal discharge and intense itching. On examination, the cervix was spotted and had the
appearance of a strawberry. Identify the causative organism.","a)Trichomonas vaginalis
b)Gardnerella vaginalis
c)Neisseria gonorrhoea
d)candida albicans","In the given clinical scenario, Trichomonas vaginalis is the likely causative agent.
vaginal itching and foul-smelling frothy vaginal discharge are seen in trichomonas vaginitis.
The given image shows colpitis macularis or strawberry cervix, which is a characteristic finding of trichomoniasis. This is due to microscopic, punctate haemorrhages of the cervix.",,A,5964-3738.PNG
Q4,Identify the contraceptive shown in the given image.,"a)Male condom
b)Female condom
c)Diaphragm
d)cervical cap","The given image shows a female condom. It consists of a pouch made of polyurethane which is 17 cm in length with a flexible ring at each end. The inner ring at the closed end is smaller than the   outer ring.
The inner ring is inserted at the apex of the vagina and the outer ring remains outside. It covers     the cervix, the entire vagina, and external genitalia. Hence, it provides protection against HIV and STDs. It has a failure rate of 5–15 per 1oo woman-years, which is higher than that of a male
condom.
It can be fitted by the patient hours before intercourse, and easily removed soon after. It covers
the cervix, vagina, and external genitalia and is protective against sexually transmitted diseases. It can also be worn in the puerperal period, unlike the cervical diaphragm.
The female condom should not be used along with a male condom because if worn together they may slip, tear, or become displaced.
The given image below shows the insertion of a female condom:",5953-3731.PNG,B,5965-3739.PNG
Q5,A woman presents to the oPD with complaints of amenorrhoea for the past year. she has a history of postpartum hemorrhage and lactational failure. what is the probable diagnosis?,"a)sheehanls syndrome
b)Rotor syndrome
c)Prolactinoma
d)Acromegaly","The clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of sheehan's syndrome.
sheehan's syndrome (ss) is postpartum hypopituitarism secondary to the necrosis of the pituitary gland. It usually results from severe hypotension or shock caused by massive hemorrhage during   or after delivery. patients with ss have varying degrees of anterior pituitary hormone deficiency.   The hyperplastic enlargement of the pituitary, which occurs normally during pregnancy, increases the risk of infarction.
Affected women may have persistent hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and lactation failure. The most prominent symptoms are lactation failure (due to a deficiency of
prolactin) and postpartum amenorrhea (due to a deficiency of gonadotropins). Because
deficiencies of some or all pituitary-responsive hormones may develop after the initial insult, sheehan syndrome can be heterogeneous and may not be identified for years.
It can present acutely as pituitary apoplexy, an endocrine emergency, characterized by a sudden onset of headache, nausea, visual deficits, and in severe cases,
severe hypoglycemia, hypotension and shock, CNs hemorrhage, and death.
Also, it can present late with the following features:
• Loss of pubic and axillary hair
• Hypothyroidism due to decreased TsH secretion
• Adrenal insufficiency due to low ACTH
Treatment is by hormone replacement - first glucocorticoids, later - thyroid hormone, sex steroids, vasopressin and growth hormones are given. If there is evidence of progressive visual loss, cranial nerve involvement or loss of consciousness, immediate surgical decompression must be carried
out. Fertility can be achieved in these women with hMG and hCG. Clomiphene is ineffective.
option B: Rotor syndrome is a type of hereditary hyperbilirubinemia with autosomal recessive inheritance. Affected individuals have mild jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia.



option C: prolactinoma or pituitary adenoids is the condition of hyperprolactinemia diagnosed by a prolactin level &gt;2oo μg/L. It usually presents with infertility, amenorrhea, and galactorrhea.
option D: Acromegaly is characterized by the signs and symptoms pertaining to excessive growth hormone secretion.",,A,
Q6,"An 18-year-old girl presents with a history of low-grade fever, weight loss, abdominal pain  and amenorrhoea for six months. on examination, a pelvic mass is felt on the left side and signs of ascites are positive. what is your diagnosis?","a)Tuberculosis with tubo-ovarian mass
b)ovarian malignancy
c)Ectopic pregnancy
d)submucous fibroid","The given clinical scenario with abdominal pain, amenorrhoea, pelvic mass and ascites is suggestive of genital tuberculosis.
Genital tuberculosis:
It is caused by M. tuberculosis and almost always occurs secondary to primary infection elsewhere in the extragenital states. The sites and frequency of involvement are as follows:
• Fallopian tubes (9o-1oo%)
• Endometrium (5o-6o%)
• ovaries (2o-3o%)
• Cervix (5-15%)
• vulva and vagina (&lt; 1%)
presentation is variable and it can be asymptomatic in 1o-2o% of cases, infertility, menstrual
irregularities, abdominal pain and mass, vaginal discharge, fistula formation, ectopic pregnancy
and ascites. The mass is made up of rolled-up omentum that is adherent to the uterus and adnexa.
Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weakness, anorexia or night sweats may be present.
Investigations:
• CBC, ESR and Mantoux test
• Hysterosalpingography shows a lead-pipe appearance of the fallopian tube, calcification of the tube, beading and variation in the filling, cornual block, jagged fluffiness of tubal outline and
tobacco pouch appearance of hydrosalpinx and pyosalpinx.
• Laparoscopy establishes the diagnosis of genital TB. It shows tuberculous lesions and perihepatic adhesions (if present).
Differential diagnosis:
• ovarian cyst, broad ligament cyst or encysted fluid
• pelvic inflammatory disease
• Ectopic pregnancy
• Carcinoma cervix
• Elephantiasis of the vulva
• pregnancy
• puberty menorrhagia and postmenopausal bleeding



• Fungal infection and sarcoidosis Management:
It is treated with anti-tubercular therapy for 6 months (DoT strategy):
Indications and contraindications for surgery:
Types of surgery include vulvectomy (if vulval hypertrophy is present), removal of the adnexal mass, drainage of pyometra and fistula repair.
TAH+Bso is rarely required nowadays. Tuboplasty is contraindicated.
option B: ovarian tumors usually don't affect menstrual cycles. Though virilizing tumors can cause amenorrhoea, other features of virilization such as hirsutism, flattening of breasts, and enlargement of the clitoris are generally present.
option C: Though ectopic pregnancy may be suspected here, the tube is likely to rupture with   exacerbation of pain, bleeding, and peritonitis before six months of gestation. Additionally, the absence of vaginal bleeding/spotting, and the presence of weight loss makes the diagnosis
unlikely.
option D: submucous fibroid is associated with menorrhagia.

Q7,"In modern obstetrics, which of the following investigations is used for monitoring the fetus of an Rh-negative sensitized mother?","a)Biophysical profile
b)Fetal blood sampling
c)Amniospectometry
d)McA doppler peak systolic velocity","MCA Doppler peak systolic velocity (psv) is used for the monitoring of fetuses in Rh-negative sensitized mothers.
The middle cerebral artery is used as other fetal vessels require a larger insonating angle and confers significant measurement error.
MCA psv is enhanced due to increased cardiac output and decreased viscosity of fetal blood, which permits the reliable, noninvasive detection of fetal anemia in cases of blood-group



alloimmunization.
If the MCA Psv exceeds 1.5 MoM (multiples ofthe median) and the gestational age is less than 34 or 35 weeks, fetal blood sampling should be considered. MCA Doppler Psv has replaced
amniocentesis as the preferred test for the detection of anemia.",,D,
Q8,what is the causative agent for granuloma inguinale?,"a)calymmatobacterium granulomatis
b)chlamydia trachomatis
c)ureaplasma urealyticum
d)Treponema pallidum","The causative agent for granuloma inguinale (donovanosis) is Calymmatobacterium
granulomatis. It is now called klebsiella granulomatis and is a gram-negative bacillus causing chronic ulcerative infection of the vulva.
It is highly contagious and transmitted through repeated sexual or non-sexual contact. The incubation period is 1-12 weeks.
Clinical features:
It begins as a painless nodule which later ulcerates to form multiple beefy red painless ulcers that tend to coalesce; the vulva is progressively destroyed, and minimal adenopathy may occur.
Diagnosis:
Microscopic examination of smears from the lesion/ biopsy specimens reveals pathognomonic     intracytoplasmic Donovan bodies and clusters of bacteria with a bipolar (safety pin) appearance. Blue-black stained organisms are seen in the cytoplasm of mononuclear cells.
Management:
Azithromycin 1 g orally once per week or 5oo mg daily for at least 3 weeks and until all lesions have completely healed.
The given image below shows the donovanosis in a female patient with a beefy red ulcer:",,A,5968-3740.PNG
Q9,which of the following is the causative organism of vulval warts?,"a)Human papilloma virus
b)Herpes simplex virus
c)Human immunodeficiency virus
d)cytomegalovirus","The causative agent of vulval warts is the human papillomavirus (HPV).
Genital warts/venereal warts/condyloma acuminata are verrucous growths that affect the skin of   the labia majora, perineum, perianal region and vulva. The lesions may be discrete or coalesce to form cauliflower-like growth. The disease is sexually transmitted. The growth of the warts is
favoured by vaginal discharge, the use of oral contraceptives, and pregnancy.
HPV causes structural changes in the epithelial cells of the skin called koilocytes, and their
presence is characteristic of HPV infection. The koilocytes have large hyperchromatic nuclei and a perinuclear halo, as shown below.


The diagnosis is made by colposcopic studies. The lesions on the vulva are stained by toluidine blue. The abnormal areas of the skin retain the blue dye. These areas are then biopsied for
histopathological examination.
The given image below shows condyloma acuminata:",,A,5969-3742.PNG;5969-3741.PNG
Q10,"A 22-year-old pregnant woman at 13 weeks of gestation informs you about accidental
exposure to radiation from a chest X-ray at 7 weeks of gestation. what should be the next step advised to her?","a)continue pregnancy
b)Terminate pregancy
c)pre-invasive diagnostic test
d)chromosome screening","In the given clinical case, the patient should be advised to continue the pregnancy.
The radiation dose to the fetus during the declared term of pregnancy should be less than 1     msv. In chest X-ray pA view, the absorbed dose of radiation by the fetus is less than o.1 msv. Hence, pregnancy can be continued.
An X-ray has a very limited role in obstetric imaging. There are very few indications where an X-ray will be useful:
• Fetal: congenital malformation of the fetus and neonates, skeletal malformations, birth injuries like fractures or dislocations.
• Maternal:  patients having cardiopulmonary disease may require an X-ray chest during pregnancy and that should be done beyond 12 weeks.
Radiation can cause fetal morbidity (FGR, genetic mutations, neurologic abnormalities, mental    retardation, childhood leukemia) and mortality. The risks are high with radiation after the first 2 weeks postconception and within the first trimester (period of organogenesis).
Radiation during pregnancy can damage the early phase of the embryo but the risk can be
minimized by using the ‘1o-day rule’. This rule states that no woman should be exposed to an X-ray for a nonurgent indication outside 1o days from her last period during the reproductive period unless the pregnancy is excluded.
The given table below shows the absorbed radiation by the fetus in different diagnostic radiation procedures:
1 cGy = 1o msv

Q11,"After successful delivery of the baby, the obstetrician witnesses that the episiotomy performed has extended backwards beyond the perineal body. which among the following structures is    likely to be injured in this case?","a)External anal sphicter
b)Ischiocavernosus
c)Bulbospongiosis
d)Urethral sphincter","External anal sphincter is the structure injured in an episiotomy extended posteriorly beyond the perineal body.
perineal tear have been divided into four degrees:
• First degree- laceration is restricted to the skin of the fourchette
• second degree- muscles of the perineal body are torn through
• Third degree- the tear extends partially backward through the external sphincter of the anus
• Fourth degree- the external anal sphincter is torn and anal mucosa is also involved
A central tear of the perineum is when the head penetrates first through the posterior vaginal  wall, then through the perineal body and appears through the skin of the perineum. It usually occurs in patients with a contracted outlet.",,A,
Q12,"A 16 year old girl presents to the opD with a history of primary amenorrhoea and cyclical
pain. perineal examination reveals a bulge protruding from the vagina. Identify the cause of this presentation:","a)Transverse septum in the proximal vagina
b)complete vaginal atresia
c)Imperforate hymen
d)cervical agenesis","A history of cyclical abdominal pain, primary amenorrhea and a bulging vaginal membrane suggest cryptomenorrhoea caused by an imperforate hymen.
Imperforate hymen is a urogenital anomaly which occurs due to failure of canalization of
the inferior end of the vaginal plate. It usually remains unrecognized until puberty. It can lead to mucocolpos in early infancy.
patients present with amenorrhea, cyclic abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, and a hypogastric  lump on abdominal examination. A bluish bulging membrane at the vaginal opening is noted on genital examination and the valsalva maneuver.
ultrasound of the pelvis reveals normal internal genitalia and hematocolpos. Laparoscopy should be performed along with hymenectomy to exclude endometriosis.
Most common causes of cryptomenorrhea:
• Intact/imperforate hymen - a bluish convex bulge is seen
• Transverse vaginal septum - a pinkish concave covering is seen
ultrasound pelvis confirms the diagnosis. A simple cruciate incision of the hymen allows the free drainage of the collected menstrual blood and restores the reproductive capacity in most cases.",,C,
Q13,"A pregnant woman presents for a routine antenatal checkup at 18 weeks of gestation. on    abdominal examination, the uterine size was found to correspond to 16 weeks of gestation. on USG, oligohydramnios was found. which of the following is a likely cause?","a)Renal agenesis
b)Fetal anemia
c)Barter syndrome
d)Anencephaly","Among the given options, renal agenesis is the likely cause. It causes oligohydramnios in the early second trimester.
Fetal urine production starts between 8-11 weeks of gestation but becomes a major component of  amniotic fluid only in the second trimester. Thus, oligohydramnios is not seen until after 18 weeks of gestation in fetuses with lethal renal abnormalities.



oligohydramnios occurs when the amniotic fluid index (AFI) is &lt;5 cm or the single deepest vertical pocket is &lt;2 cm. AFI between 5-8 cm is known as borderline oligohydramnios.
Diagnosis of oligohydramnios:
•  uterine size is much smaller than the period of amenorrhea
•  Less fetal movements
•  The uterus is ‘full of fetus’ due to scanty liquor
•  Malpresentation (breech) is common
•  Evidence of intrauterine growth retardation of the fetus is seen
•  sonographic diagnosis is made when the largest liquor pool is less than 2 cm
other options:
Fetal anemia, Bartter syndrome and Liddle syndrome usually lead to polyhydramnios and not oligohydramnios.",,A,
Q14,"A 24-year-old woman visits the infertility clinic with a complaint of recurrent abortions. upon investigations, she is found to have a septate uterus. which of the following corrective
procedures has the best obstetric outcome?","a)Jones metroplasty
b)strassmann metroplasty
c)Tompkins metroplasty
d)Transcervical resection of septum","Transcervical hysteroscopic resection of the septum has the best obstetric outcome.
The procedure involves the resection of the septum under hysteroscopic guidance. Hence, it doesn't scar the uterus and avoids the necessity of cesarean sections for future pregnancies   improving obstetric outcomes.
Metroplasty is the surgical resection of the intrauterine septum. This is done by approaching the uterus transabdominally via 3 methods:
• Jones metroplasty
• strassmann metroplasty
• Tompkins metroplasty
All of these methods are not preferred nowadays as they cause uterine scarring.",,D,
Q15,A 33-year-old female patient comes with complaints of menorrhagia for the past 3 months.    The duration and regularity of her menstrual cycles are normal. Non-hormonal management has been tried without success. what is the most appropriate next step?,"a)uterine artery embolisation
b)Endometrial ablation
c)Hormonal therapy
d)Hysterectomy","Hormonal therapy is the next best step in the given scenario of menorrhagia that is unresponsive to non-hormonal therapy.
Menorrhagia/heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as heavy but regular menstrual bleeding,     &gt;8omL of blood loss, or &gt;8 days of bleeding per menstrual period. It can be acute (&lt;6 months) or chronic (&gt;6 months).
It is managed as follows:
• Medical - first line of treatment.
• NsAIDs



• Tranexamic acid
• oCps/progestogens - if non-hormonal management fails
• Mirena IuCD
• GnRH agonists
• Blood transfusion, if required
• surgical - if medical management fails, depending on the diagnosis:
• Endometrial ablation - hysteroscopic, TCRE, RITEA, microwave, Novasure, etc (option B)
• uterine artery embolization (option A)
• uterine tamponade
• Hysterectomy - if all minimally invasive methods fail (option D)",,C,
Q16,A 6o-year-old woman presented with post-menopausal bleeding. ultrasonography revealed a mass with feeding vessel as shown in the image below. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Fibroid uterus
b)Endometrial polyp
c)Endometrial carcinoma
d)Leiomyosarcoma","Visualization of a mass with a single feeding vessel on a color Doppler is characteristic of
an endometrial polyp.  In contrast, submucous leiomyomas often receive blood flow from multiple vessels (option A).
Endometrial polyps are soft, fleshy growths within the uterus that consist of endometrial glands, fibrous stroma, and surface epithelium. Risk factors for endometrial polyps include increasing
age, obesity, and tamoxifen use.
They are usually asymptomatic. when symptomatic, they present with heavy menstrual bleeding, prolonged bleeding, intermenstrual bleeding, or infertility.
The main diagnostic tools for endometrial polyps include transvaginal ultrasound (TVs) with applied color Doppler, saline infusion sonography, and hysteroscopy.
The risk factors for the malignant transformation include postmenopausal status, age older than 6o, and abnormal bleeding. other factors such as larger polyp size (&gt;1.5 cm), tamoxifen use,   diabetes, and obesity may also contribute to a higher risk.
Hysteroscopic polypectomy may be considered most effective for symptomatic women or those with risk factors for malignant transformation.",5956-3732.PNG,B,
Q17,"A 35-year-old primigravida who conceived after in-vitro fertilization therapy came for an
antenatal checkup at 38 weeks of gestation. Her obstetric history revealed that she was
pregnant with DcDA twins. on examination, the first twin was found to be in a breech
position and the maternal blood pressure was found to be greater than 14o/9o mm Hg on two occasions with grade 1+ proteinuria. what should be done next?","a)Monitor BP and terminate pregnancy if BP rises
b)Immediate caesarean section
c)Terminate pregnancy at 4o weeks of gestation
d)Induce labour with PGE2 gel","Immediate cesarean section is done as the first twin is in breech presentation. uncomplicated dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies are terminated at 38 weeks of gestation.
Timing of delivery depends on the type of twin pregnancy:
The mode of delivery depends on the 1st twin:
After delivery of 1st twin, if the 2nd twin is in breech, assisted breech delivery is done. If the 2nd twin is in a transverse lie, the internal podalic version is done under GA in the oT followed by



breech extraction.
complications in attempting vaginal delivery in non-vertex presentation (i.e) transverse and breech:
• Interlocking of twins
• Fetal head trapping above the cervix
• umbilical cord prolapse
According to AcOG criteria (2019), preeclampsia requires proteinuria of grade 2+ or more. In the case of pre-eclampsia, termination of pregnancy must be done at 37 weeks. According to the
updated criteria, this patient does not have pre-eclampsia. Hence, a caesarean section can be done at 38 weeks as for any uncomplicated DcDA twin pregnancy.

Q18,which of the following effects of puberty are not mediated by estrogen?,"a)Hair growth
b)cervical mucus secretion
c)vaginal cornification
d)Menstruation","pubarche or the development of axillary and pubic hair is not mediated by estrogen. It occurs due to testosterone in both sexes. Around 50% of testosterone comes from the ovaries and the rest
from the adrenal gland.
puberty in girls involves breast development (thelarche), an increase in adrenal androgen secretion (adrenarche), and the beginning of menstrual cycles (menarche).
Estrogen has the following actions during puberty:
• Breast development
• Development of the reproductive tract
• starting of menstruation (option D)
• Increased fat in the hips
• Regulation of pubertal growth spurt



• Vaginal cornification (option c)
• cervical mucus production (option B)
• Epiphyseal closure
• Maintenance of bone formation - acts against parathyroid hormone.",,A,
Q19,"A 35-year-old woman comes with complaints of warty lesions on the vulva. on examination, multiple warty growths on the vulva and around the anal canal are seen. This condition is
most likely seen in?","a)condyloma accuminata
b)Molluscum contagiosum
c)chancroid
d)Herpes","Multiple warty growths on the vulva (shown below) and around the anal canal are suggestive   of condyloma acuminata (genital warts). HPV 6 and 11 are associated with the development of condyloma acuminatum. They are sexually transmitted.
The verrucous growths may appear discrete or coalesce to form large cauliflower-like growths. Infections are often transient in young women but can persist and progress to cancer in older
women and immunocompromised individuals. Histopathology will show koilocytes, perinuclear halo, multinucleation, and acanthosis.
Treatment options include podophyllin, trichloroacetic acid, and surgical removal. The use of
podophyllin cream is contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy. Larger lesions can be
removed with a diathermy loop or laser ablation. cesarean section is advised for women with
genital warts during early labor to prevent the risk of transmitting laryngeal papillomatosis to the newborn.


option B: Molluscum contagiosum presents as a crop of small domed vesicles with central umbilication (shown below). It is caused by the pox virus and it spreads by close sexual or nonsexual contact and by autoinoculation.





option C: Chancroid appears as small papules that develop into painful ulcerating pustules. They are associated with unilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. It is caused by H. ducreyi.
option D: Herpes appears as multiple crops of vesicles and ulcers.",,A,5975-3743.PNG;5976-3744.PNG
Q20,A patient is planned to undergo hysteroscopic polypectomy using bipolar electrocautery. what is the ideal agent for distention?,"a)Glycine
b)Normal saline
c)Co2
d)7o% dextrose","Normal saline is the ideal fluid media used for bipolar electrocautery as it can function regardless of the fluid electrolyte content.
Normal saline and lactated Ringer solutions are commonly used isotonic, electrolyte-containing fluids in operating rooms for diagnostic hysteroscopy procedures. These solutions can cause
volume overload and, if rapidly absorbed in large volumes, may lead to pulmonary edema.
Isotonic, electrolyte-containing fluids are contraindicated for use with monopolar electrosurgical devices because they conduct electrical current, dissipate instrument energy and render the
instrument ineffective. Low-viscosity, electrolyte-poor fluids such as 1.5-percent glycine, 3-percent sorbitol, and 5-percent mannitol are preferred as they are non-conductive and can be safely used   with monopolar electrosurgical energy devices.
The primary risk of using hypotonic, hypoosmolar solutions is the intravascular absorption of these fluids, which can lead to acute hyponatremia and hypo osmolality.
The criteria for terminating the procedure for electrolyte-deficient fluid is a deficit of 1 L and electrolyte-rich fluid is a deficit of 2.5 L.",,B,

Q22,A woman with a history of infertility is on treatment with human menopausal gonadotropin. She presented with the following finding in the USG. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome
b)Theca lutein cyst
c)Polycystic ovarian syndrome
d)None","The image showing enlarged ovaries with multiple large cysts along with the history of treatment for infertility with human menopausal gonadotropin suggests the diagnosis of ovarian
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).
Human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) is a medication that is composed of FSH and LH. It is used to stimulate the release of ova in women who do not ovulate spontaneously. It can lead
to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) is a condition associated with ovarian enlargement due to exogenous gonadotropin therapy. Symptoms include abdominal pain, distention, ascites,   gastrointestinal problems, respiratory compromise, oliguria, and thromboembolism. It can occur during ovulation induction or in early pregnancies conceived through exogenous ovarian
stimulation.
predisposing factors for OHSS include multi-follicular ovaries (such as in pcOS), young age, high estradiol levels during ovulation induction, and pregnancy.
Vasoactive substances produced by the corpus luteum, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiotensin II, are believed to contribute to enhanced capillary
permeability, resulting in the loss of fluid, protein, and electrolytes into the peritoneal cavity and hemoconcentration.



Sonographic examination reveals enlarged ovaries with numerous follicular cysts and ascites.
Maintaining fluid balance with isotonic fluids like normal saline is crucial. Strategies to prevent
oHSS during exogenous ovulation include reducing follicular stimulation (low FSH dose), coasting (withholding FSH administration one or more days prior to the hcG trigger),
prophylactic volume expanders, and substituting hcG for FSH towards the end of ovarian stimulation.
other options:
option B: Theca lutein cysts are a rare form of follicular cysts characterized by luteinization and hypertrophy of the theca interna layer. Both ovaries are enlarged and cystic. This condition is
commonly associated with gestational trophoblastic disease, multifetal gestation, and placentomegaly.
option c: polycystic ovarian syndrome shows 12 or more small follicles each 2-9 mm in size placed peripherally (necklace pattern) (shown below). The patient presents with menstrual    irregularities, hirsutism, acne, etc.",5958-3733.PNG,A,5978-3746.PNG
Q23,A lady who is 38 weeks pregnant comes to the OPD for a routine checkup. She has a history of normal twin delivery at term 4 years ago. what is her gravida and para score?,"a)G2P2
b)G2P1
c)G3P2
d)G3P1","The woman has had two pregnancies in total - the previous twin pregnancy and the current
pregnancy, hence the gravida score is 2. The first pregnancy resulted in delivery at term (crossed viable period), hence her para score is 1 (parity doesn't include current pregnancy).  Hence, her    obstetric score would be G2p1 (Gravida - 2, para - 1).
Multifetal pregnancies count as one for both gravida and para. A pregnant woman who delivers twins for the first time is expressed as primipara.
The obstetric score is used to summarise the past obstetric history as follows:
• G - Gravidity, denoting the total number of pregnancies, including the present one
• p - parity, denoting the total number of pregnancies crossing the period of viability. This includes both live births and stillbirths. The current pregnancy is not included.



• A - Abortion is the termination of pregnancy, either spontaneous or induced, before fetal viability.
• L - Living children.
The GTPAL system includes the following:
• Gravida
• Term (&gt;37 weeks)
• Preterm (2ow - 36w 6d)
• Abortions (&lt;2o weeks)

Note: The period of viability is when the fetus is capable of independent existence. The WHO defines it to be 24 weeks while the Indian definition is 28 weeks.",,B,
Q24,Identify the finding seen in this hysterosalpingogram:,"a)Bilateral hydrosalpinx
b)Extravasation into venous system
c)Normal HSG
d)Bilateral cornual block","The image showing bilateral ballooned-out tubes filled with contrast is suggestive of bilateral hydrosalpinx.
Hydrosalpinx is a chronic cystic swelling of the fallopian tube caused by distal tubal obstruction,    usually bilateral. It is associated with conditions like PID and endometriosis. Grossly, the fimbriae and tubal ostia are replaced by a smooth, dilated end. The ballooned elongated tubes are filled
with clear fluid.
ultrasound reveals a cystic, elongated structure with thin walls, incomplete septa, and anechoic  contents. Hysterosalpingography shows dilated, clubbed fallopian tubes filled with contrast. The interstitial end of the tube is open whereas the fimbrial end is indrawn and closed. This permits  the dye to enter but not exit the tube during hysterosalpingography.
Laparoscopic treatment options for those not seeking to preserve fertility include adhesion lysis  and salpingectomy. For infertile women, laparoscopic neo-salpingostomy is done  for mild tubal disease. In vitro fertilization (IVF) may be a better option for severe tubal disease.
The image given below shows bilateral hydrosalpinx:",5959-3734.PNG,A,5980-3747.PNG
Q25,Identify the maternal condition that can lead to the findings in the baby as shown below.,"a)pre-gestational diabetes
b)Gestational diabetes mellitus
c)Effect of valproate
d)Hypertensive on ACE inhibitors","The image showing a poorly developed lower limb suggests the diagnosis of caudal regression    sequence/sacral agenesis seen in pregestational diabetes. It is the most specific anomaly seen in diabetes.
The caudal regression sequence is a rare malformation, frequently associated with maternal pre-gestational diabetes. It consists of a spectrum of structural defects of the caudal region,  including incomplete development of the sacrum and the lumbar vertebrae.
Elevated maternal HbA1c levels correlate with fetal malformations. It occurs approximately 2oo times more frequently in infants of diabetic mothers than in other infants.
overt diabetes (pregestational diabetes) is associated with higher malformation rates than the
general population. Neural tube defects (encephalocele, meningomyelocele, anencephaly),
transposition of great vessels, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, hypoplastic left heart, aortic stenosis and coarctation of the aorta are commonly seen.
small left colon syndrome is a rare anomaly that develops in the second and third trimesters.
option B: Malformations are not associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
Malformations occur due to the disruption of organogenesis, usually occurring in the first trimester. The abnormal glycemic status in GDM manifests only in the second trimester.
option C: valproate leads to neural tube defects and not sacral agenesis.
option D: ACE inhibitors can cause oligohydramnios.",5960-3735.PNG,A,
Q26,A woman with endometrial carcinoma is undergoing radiotherapy. which of the following is true?,"a)Intensity is inversely proportional to squared distance
b)small blood vessels are most radioresistant
c)Rapidly proliferating cells are most radioresistant
d)small bowel is most radioresistant","The intensity of radiation is inversely proportional to the squared distance. This is known as the inverse square law in radiotherapy.



chemoradiation is the mainstay of treatment of stage III and IV endometrial cancers. They are  treated with brachytherapy followed by external radiation. Brachytherapy is a form of radiation therapy in which the radiation source is placed close to the tumor.
other options:
option B: Larger blood vessels are more radioresistant than microvasculature.
option c: permanent non-dividing cells are more radioresistant than rapidly proliferating cells. option D: small intestinal epithelial cells (intestinal crypts), which divide rapidly with no
differentiation are the most radiosensitive.",,A,
Q27,Identify the use of the instrument given below:,"a)For tubal ligation
b)For ligation of uterine artery during hysterectomy
c)ovarian cystectomy
d)Ectopic pregnancy","The given instrument is a fallope ring applicator. It is used in tubal ligation.
Falope ring sterilization is accomplished by applying silicone rubber bands to the fallopian tubes. The major advantage is the elimination of thermocoagulation. The occlusion is only in a short
segment and can allow for tubal reconstruction.",5961-3736.PNG,A,
Q28,All of the following are contraceptive methods used post-coitus except:,"a)Danazol
b)CuT2oo
c)RU486
d)Combined high dose estrogen-progestin pills","Danazol is not used as a post-coitus contraceptive.
Danazol, a synthetic derivative of ethinyl testosterone, acts by inhibiting pituitary gonadotropins. It possesses mild anabolic, anti-estrogenic, and anti-progestational properties. It is used in
abnormal uterine bleeding, endometriosis, and cyclic mastalgia.
Emergency or post-coital contraceptives are used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected
intercourse. They are interceptives. Their main action is to make the endometrium unsuitable for implantation. They can also delay or inhibit ovulation, and prevent fertilization of the egg by
sperm.
Methods of emergency contraception:

Drug	Dose
Levonorgestrel	o.75mg stat and after 12 hour s or a single dose of 1.5mg st   at. Taken within 72 hours ca   n extend upto 12o hours
Ethinyl estradiol 5o μg + Nor gestrel o.25 mg (yuzpe meth  od)	2 tab stat and 2 tabs after 12 hours
