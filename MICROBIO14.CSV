Q1,"A 24-year-old female comes to the oPD with dysuria. she has a non-irritant profuse white discharge from her vagina. on examination, her labia were inflamed and swollen. The
openings of her urethra and Bartholin's glands were congested. on further collection of her endocervical discharge, intracellular gram-negative diplococci were found. which of the
following is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Neisseria Gonnorhea
b)chlamydia Trachomatis
c)Treponema Pallidum
d)Hemophilus Ducreyi","The above clinical scenario and endocervical examination of gram-negative diplococci denote a diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoea.
Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted disease where infection occurs due to the adhesion of     gonococci to the urethra or other mucosal surfaces with the help of pili. By the third day of     infection, the cocci have penetrated intracellular spaces and reached subepithelial tissue. The incubation period ranges from 2 to 8 days. The main symptoms are urethral discharge and
dysuria.
In females :
The infection begins in the cervix uteri and urethra and may spread to the Bartholin glands,
endometrium, and fallopian tubes. The vaginal mucosa is usually unaffected in adults because the stratified squamous epithelium is resistant to cocci infection and also because vaginal secretions    have an acidic pH. Rarely peritonitis may develop with perihepatic inflammation (Fitz Hugh
curtis syndrome).
In males :
The disease starts as acute urethritis. This infection has the potential to spread down the urethra and into the prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymis. chronic urethritis may lead to stricture    formation. Infections in the periurethral tissues can lead to abscesses and multiple discharging    sinuses (watercan perineum).
Lab diagnosis:
The discharge is collected and subjected to Gram's stain which reveals gram■negative
intracellular diplococci within phagocytes. stuart's transport medium is used. specifically, Thayer-Martin agar is used to isolate Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
Treatment: ceftriaxone (25o mg, IM) single-dose + azithromycin 1 g Po, single-dose, or doxycycline 1oo mg Po BD for 7 days.
The image below shows the Gram-stain of a urethral exudate showing typical intracellular gram-negative diplococci and pleomorphic extracellular gram-negative organisms",,A,1732-1100.PNG
Q2,Drug resistance is seen with which of the following sTD?,"a)syphilis
b)Gonorrhoea
c)chancroid
d)Donovanosis","Neisseria gonorrhoea endures maximum drug resistance among the given organisms causing sexually transmitted diseases.
The ability of N. gonorrhoea to change its antigenic properties and adapt to different
environments has rendered it resistant to the majority of antibiotics. Gonococci develop complete resistance to antibiotics, either through chromosomal mutations or by acquiring R factors, which  are plasmids.
• often β-Lactamase producing Gonococci and tetracycline-resistant strains occur together. Hence penicillin, ampicillin, and tetracycline are no longer reliable for the treatment of gonorrhea and
should not be used.
• changes in DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV have been identified as mechanisms contributing to fluoroquinolone resistance.
• Mechanisms leading to enhanced drug efflux pump and reduced drug influx through porB, collectively contribute to resistance against third-generation cephalosporins.
currently, the effective first-line treatment of choice for uncomplicated Gonococcal infection remains ceftriaxone (5oo mg IM, single dose) plus Azithromycin (1 g po, single dose) .
other options :
A) syphilis :  The drug of choice for treating syphilis is benzathine penicillin G. penicillin has been the mainstay of treatment for syphilis for many years due to its effectiveness in curing the
infection and its relatively low cost.
c) chancroid: The drug of choice for treating chancroid, a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Haemophilus ducreyi, is azithromycin or ceftriaxone. These antibiotics are effective in treating chancroid and preventing its complications. The choice between azithromycin and
ceftriaxone may depend on factors such as patient allergies, local resistance patterns, and individual patient factors.



d) Donovanosis : The drug of choice for treating donovanosis, also known as granuloma inguinale, is typically azithromycin or doxycycline. Donovanosis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium klebsiella granulomatis, and prompt treatment is essential to prevent
complications and transmission to others.",,B,
Q3,which of the following parasites reproduce directly from egg to larva without fertilisation through parthenogenesis?,"a)strongyloides stercoralis
b)Ancylostoma doudenale
c)Enterobius
d)Trichuris trichura","The females of strongyloides stercoralis are known to be parthenogenetic i.e. capable of
generating offspring without the need for fertilisation by a male.
strongyloides stercoralis has a parasitic cycle and a free-living cycle in soil. Humans are the natural host but morphologically indistinguishable strains may be seen in dogs and cats.
Filariform larvae are the infective form and there are two modes of infection: penetration of the skin by 3rd stage filariform larva, and autoinfection (external and internal).
The female worms present in the intestine lay eggs in the mucosa which hatches immediately, releasing the rhabditiform larva. The larva migrates into the lumen of the intestine and passes down to be released into the faeces. The rhabditiform larva may change into a filariform larva  while passing through the bowel.
The filariform larvae in the bowel do not leave the host and become a source of autoinfection as  they penetrate the colonic mucosa or perianal skin. The rhabditiform larvae passed in the faeces may undergo two types of development in the soil:
• Direct development: The rhabditiform larva moults twice on reaching the soil to become the infective filariform larva. The filariform larva can penetrate the skin and enter the circulation.
• Indirect development: The rhabditiform larvae develop into free-living males and females in the soil.
other options :
option B: Ancyclostoma duodenale are dioecious parasites, there is no multiplication within the host, and a single infective larva matures into either a male or a female adult to undergo mating through copulation. It typically takes around 6 weeks from the point of infection for the adult
worms to reach sexual maturity and initiate egg-laying.
option C: Enterobius vermicularis is dioecious.The male is usually unseen as it does not migrate from caecum or appendix. It usually dies after mating and is passed in the faeces. The gravid
female migrates down the colon to the rectum and a single worm lays from 5ooo to 17,ooo eggs option D: Trichuris trichuria or the whipworm has a distinct male and female parasite and is
typically dioecious. The fertilised female lays about 5ooo eggs per day.",,A,1734-1101.PNG
Q4,which is the best test used for Malarial parasite speciation?,"a)Acridine orange stained thin smear
b)Giemsa-stained thin smear
c)Giemsa-stained thick smear
d)Quantitative Buffy coat (QBc)","Malarial parasite speciation is best done by a Giemsa-stained thin smear.
Microscopy is the best method for the diagnosis of malaria due to its high sensitivity and
specificity.A diluted Giemsa stain is applied to both thick and thin films and left to dry for thirty minutes to two hours. Afterwards, the slide is rinsed and dried.
Thin smear is used to identify the particular infecting species of plasmodium. It is prepared by air drying for 1o minutes and fixed in methanol. Thus, the plasmodia morphology is not distorted.
Thick smear is used to detect infection and estimate parasite concentration. The correct thickness is the thickness through which a newsprint is barely visible. It is prepared by slow-drying for 3o    minutes, which leads to hemolysis and distortion of the plasmodia morphology. The thick film is   not fixed using methanol as it can become dehaemoglobinised.  Hence, species cannot be
detected.
For rapid staining, especially beneficial for fieldwork, the Field's stain is utilized. In India, the frequently employed rapid staining method is the JSB stain, named after Jaswant Singh and    Bhattacharji.
The following image shows the difference between thick and thin smear.
• when properly prepared, the thick film will just permit printed letters to be visible when viewed through it.
• A well-prepared thin film will consist of a continuous smear of a single layer of red cells,   terminating in a tapered tongue end that falls slightly before reaching the edge of the slide.





other options:
option D: The QBC method is a rapid test for malaria which is highly sensitive and specific. In this method, a small amount of blood (5o to 11o μl) is centrifuged in the QBC centrifuge,
concentrating parasites near the tip of the red blood cell column.
option A: Acridine orange is a fluorescent stain used in the QBC test of malaria.RBC tubes are     pre-coated with acridine orange, and parasites fluoresce, making them easily visible under an oil immersion microscope. It is hence not the ideal stain used for speciation.",,B,1735-1102.PNG
Q5,"Assertion(A): Late trophozoite and schizont stage in plasmodium falciparum are not seen in blood smears. Reason(R): These two stages are trapped in the capillary endothelium of
internal organs due to cytoadherence.","a)Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and reason is Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A)
b)Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and reason is Reason (R) is not the correct explanation of Assertion (A)
c)Assertion (A) is true and Reason (R) is false
d)Assertion (A) is false and Reason (R) is true","Late trophozoite, early and mature schizonts are stages in the asexual life cycle of P.falciparum. These stages are usually not seen in the peripheral smear unless the malaria is exceptionally
severe or pernicious. In regular conditions, These two stages are trapped in the capillary endothelium of internal organs due to cytoadherence.
Plasmodium falciparum is the most highly pathogenic strain of malaria, causing fatal
complications. Hence, it is also called malignant tertian or pernicious malaria. The life cycle of
P.falciparum can be divided into three primary stages based on whether parasites are in the liver, the bloodstream or the mosquito's stomach.
Exo-erythrocytic cycle-Human liver :
• The female anopheles mosquito injects parasites (sporozoites) into the human after a blood meal. The sporozoites are sickle-shaped and invade into hepatocytes.
• sporozoites mature into schizonts which release merozoites
Erythrocytic cycle:
• Merozoites leave the liver and invade red blood cells, in which they reproduce asexually and develop into trophozoites.



• Early ring trophozoites are often seen attached along the margin of the red cell, the so-called form applique or accole. Binucleate rings are common resembling stereo headphones in
appearance. several rings may be seen within a single erythrocyte.
• Typically, the trophozoites vanish from the bloodstream within approximately 24 hours.
• By this time, a strain-specific high molecular weight antigen emerges on the surface of infected red cells resembling a knob-like projection on the erythrocyte membrane.
• Infected red cells with presenting antigen, exit the bloodstream and stick to the walls of small
blood vessels(cytoadherence) of internal organs, including the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, spleen, intestines, bone marrow, and placenta.
• This adherence leads to the sequestration of infected cells in these areas, contributing to severe complications like cerebral malaria.
sporogonic cycle- Mosquito :
•  Gametocytes are taken up by a mosquito when it feeds. (9-12) Gametocytes undergo sexual     reproduction in the midgut of the mosquito and develop into sporozoites, which migrate to the salivary glands.
• The mosquito injects sporozoites through saliva into another human source.
Major manifestations of severe falciparum malaria include more than two convulsions in 24
hours, unarousable coma/ cerebral malaria (failure to localise or respond appropriately to stimuli or coma persisting for &gt;3o min after generalised convulsion), acidosis, severe normocytic
normochromic anaemia, renal failure, pulmonary oedema, hypoglycemia, shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
other manifestations include hemoglobinuria, hyperparasitemia, jaundice, and extreme weakness. The treatment of choice is artesunate given at a dose of 2.4 mg/kg stat IV, followed by 2.4 mg/kg    at 12 and 24 hours, and then daily if necessary.

Q6,which of the following pathological features is incorrectly matched with the disease?,"a)No reaction: Immunodeficiency disease
b)cytopathic and cytoproliferative effect : chickenpox
c)Mononuclear and granulomatous lesions: Berylliosis
d)suppurative and purulent lesions: syphilis","syphilis is not known to cause suppurative and purulent lesions. It causes macular, papular or mixed maculopapular lesions.
syphilis presents with the following lesions as it progresses through different stages :
• primary syphilis - Hard chancre, which is painless papule that becomes eroded and indurated.
• secondary syphilis - skin rashes on palms and soles which may be macular, papular, papulosquamous and nodular, but never vesicular or bullous.
• condylomata lata- mucocutaneous papules that coalesce to form large pink to grey lesions in warm moist intertriginous areas)
• Generalized lymphadenopathy is seen
• Tertiary syphilis - Gummas, which are locally destructive granulomatous lesions. They are most commonly seen in bone and skin.
other options :
option A - Immunodeficient individuals lack the normal response to antigens. This is the reason for the false negative Mantoux test seen in such individuals.
option B - chickenpox belongs to the alpha subfamily of herpes group of viruses which has a cytopathic effect of formation of multinucleated giant cells, with rounding and ballooning of  infected cells
option c - Berryliosis is an occupational lung disease, causing a chronic granulomatous
inflammatory disease similar to sarcoidosis. Biopsy reveals non-caseating granulomas with monocytic infiltration.",,D,
Q7,"out of the given lab sterilisation techniques, which of the following can be used for a disposable pipette tip?","a)A only
b)D only
c)A,B
d)c,D","The most common and effective method to sterilise disposable pipette tips is by using an autoclave.
Autoclaving involves subjecting the pipette tips to high-pressure steam at temperatures above
121°c (25o°F) for around 2o minutes. This process effectively kills microorganisms and sterilises the pipette tips for reuse. However, it's important to check the manufacturer's instructions to
ensure that the pipette tips are autoclavable and to follow proper sterilisation protocols to maintain their integrity and functionality.",,A,
Q8,which of the following is transmitted by all the components of blood?,"a)syphilis
b)Malaria
c)Filaria
d)Toxoplasma","Among the options provided, Malaria is the only disease transmitted by all components of blood.
Malaria is primarily spread through the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes, which inject
sporozoites into the bloodstream but can also be transmitted by transfusion of blood and blood products.



other options:
option A : syphilis is primarily transmitted through direct contact with syphilitic sores (chancres), which can occur on the genitals, lips, mouth, or anus during sexual activity.In most cases,
transmission via blood transfusion is rare.
option c:  Filarial parasites are primarily transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes.
However, they can also be found in the blood of infected individuals, which can potentially
transmit the infection through blood transfusion. However, plasma and platelets may not typically harbor filarial parasites unless there's concurrent infection or contamination.
option D: Toxoplasma is transmitted through various routes, including ingestion of contaminated food or water, contact with infected cat feces, and transplacental transmission from mother to
fetus. However, it is not primarily transmitted through blood",,B,
Q9,The following statements are connected with 'because',"a)statement 1 and statement 2 are true and statement 2 is correct explanation of statement 1
b)statement 1 and statement 2 are true but statement 2 is not the correct explanation of statement 1
c)statement 1 is true and statement 2 is false
d)Both the statements 1 and 2 are false","The statement Faucial diphtheria can cause death due to myocarditis is true. However,
corynebacterium diphtheria causes myocarditis due to toxaemia and not bacteremia.
corynebacterium diptheriae produces the diphtheria toxin, which is an AB subunit toxin. while
the B subunit helps in attachment to cell surface receptors, the A subunit causes ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor-2 (EF-2) resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis.


The exotoxin A produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, also an AB subunit toxin, acts by the same mechanism to cause inhibition of protein synthesis.
This infection presents as fever and sore throat, which progresses to dyspnea due to obstruction by the pseudomembrane. Bull's neck appearance is seen due to cervical lymphadenitis.
complications of c.diphtheriae:
• damage to the heart (myocarditis)
• kidney (tubular necrosis)



• liver and adrenal glands can be affected due to the toxin
In respiratory diphtheria patients, cardiac complications, particularly myocarditis, arise in around 1o-25% of cases. cardiac involvement is the leading cause of death in diphtheria, with a mortality  rate of 5o-75%. Manifestations of cardiac involvement vary and may encompass myocardial
dysfunction, rhythm disturbances such as bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias, and heart blocks necessitating pacing. Elevated cardiac enzymes and EcG abnormalities may signal
asymptomatic myocardial involvement.",,C,1677-1070.PNG
Q10,A construction worker presents with a lockjaw and muscle rigidity. He gives a history of exposure to a rusted iron nail through an existing wound. which of the following is the    mechanism of action of the toxin responsible for this presentation ?,"a)Inhibition of Acetyl choline release
b)Inhibition of glycine and GABA release
c)Inhibition of epinephrine
d)Inhibition of Nor-epinephrine","The above clinical scenario, coupled with a history of contact with a rusty iron nail, suggests a   diagnosis of tetanus, which is caused by the anaerobic bacterium clostridium tetani. The toxin  responsible for muscle rigidity and lockjaw is tetanospasmin produced by clostridium tetani. It acts by causing presynaptic inhibition of GABA and glycine release.
Tetanospasmin, after secretion by the bacterium is cleaved into two peptides linked by a
disulphide bond. The larger peptide diffuses to terminals of neurons and migrates by the
retrograde axonal transport system to the spinal cord and brainstem. It diffuses to the glycinergic  interneurons and GABA secreting neurons there. The smaller peptide degrades synaptobrevin and blocks the release of the inhibitory glycine and GABA. This results in hyperreflexia, muscle
spasms, and spastic paralysis. Even small amounts of the toxin can be lethal.
The incubation period of c. tetani ranges from 4-5 days up to 3 weeks. Muscle spasms usually involve the area of injury first and then the muscles of the jaw causing trismus or lockjaw.
Gradually, other voluntary muscles become involved, resulting in tonic spasms. Any external
stimulus can precipitate a tetanic generalized muscle spasm. The patient is conscious but may be in pain. Death usually results from respiratory paralysis.
other options:
option A : Botulinum toxin targets the presynaptic terminals of motor neurons and inhibit the
release of acetylcholine. As a result, muscle paralysis occurs, leading to the temporary weakening or cessation of muscle activity in the affected area.
option D: The venom of the black widow spider, specifically the component α-latrotoxin, has been found to induce the massive release of neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine,
norepinephrine, dopamine, and others, from presynaptic nerve terminals rather than inhibition of
nor-epinephrine.",,B,
Q11,which of the following immunodeficiency diseases predisposes to infection by catalase-positive organisms?,"a)severe combined immunodeficiency (sCID)
b)Hyper IgE syndrome
c)X-linked agammaglobulinemia
d)chronic granulomatous disease","chronic granulomatous disease (cGD) is a rare inherited immune system disorder predisposing    individuals to infection by catalase-positive organisms. It is mostly acquired as X-linked recessive seen in boys or very rarely autosomal recessive seen in girls.
The most common organism is s. aureus, but any catalase-positive microorganism may be
involved. other organisms frequently causing infections include serratia marcescens, B. cepacia, Aspergillus, candida albicans, Nocardia, and salmonella. There may also be increased



susceptibility to mycobacteria, including the bacille calmette-Gue■rin vaccine. catalase-negative bacteria like streptococci and pneumococci are efficiently handled by the immune system.
This disease manifests itself as chronic suppurative granulomatous lesions of the skin and lymph nodes, along with hepatosplenomegaly, progressive lung infilterates and granulomatous septic
osteomyelitis.
cGD is usually diagnosed in early childhood:
• phagocytes cannot efficiently produce reactive oxygen species (R0S), which are crucial for destroying pathogens engulfed by these cells.
• Reduced hydrogen peroxide (H202) production seems to be the primary cause of the impaired bactericidal function.
• Failure of leucocyte degranulation after phagocytosis, leading to delayed granule rupture and faulty release of myeloperoxidase further contributes to ineffective bactericidal activity.
• Bacteria proliferate within the cells, shielded from antibodies and antibiotics due to their intracellular location, leading to the establishment of chronic suppurative infection.
• Humoral and cellular immune response is normal
Nitroblue-tetrazolium test: This is used as a screening method for the diagnosis of chronic
granulomatous disease. Leucocytes of induviduals with cGD fail to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium in cGD, due to a defect in the NADpH oxidase complex, neutrophils are unable to perform this  reduction, leading to a negative or deficient result in the NBT test.
Treatment typically involves long-term antibiotic and antifungal therapy to prevent and manage infections. In some cases, bone marrow transplantation may be considered a potential cure for   cGD. corticosteroids may be useful for the treatment of children with antral and urethral
obstruction or severe granulomatous colitis.",,D,
Q12,which of the following is not a clinical manifestation of parvovirus B19 infection?,"a)Hydrops fetalis
b)persistent anemia or pure red cell aplasia in immunodeficient individuals
c)Transient aplastic crisis in children with hemolytic anemia
d)Febrile illness with petechial rash","The characteristic clinical manifestation of parvovirus is febrile illness with an erythematous rash. petechial rash is seen only in some patients.
parvovirus B19 is the smallest single-stranded DNA virus belonging to the family parvoviridae. It is a non-enveloped virus with an icosahedral capsid. The virus is primarily transmitted through
respiratory secretions, such as saliva and respiratory droplets. It can also be transmitted vertically from mother to fetus during pregnancy, leading to congenital infection.
clinical manifestations:
Erythema infectiosum (Fifth Disease): characterized by a ""slapped cheek"" rash on the face, the      most common manifestation of parvovirus B19 infection. This is due to erythematous flushing of the cheeks. This is followed by a lacy, macular erythematous rash on the trunk and limbs. The
rash typically resolves within 1-3 weeks but may recur with exposure to sunlight or heat.
Arthropathy: Transient arthritis, predominantly affecting the joints of the hands, wrists, knees,    and ankles. Arthropathy typically occurs in adults, especially women, and may persist for several weeks to months.



Aplastic crisis: In individuals with underlying hemolytic disorders, such as sickle cell disease or   hereditary spherocytosis, parvovirus B19 infection can precipitate a transient aplastic crisis. This results in a severe reduction in red blood cell production, leading to anaemia.
Hydrops fetalis: vertical transmission of parvovirus B19 during pregnancy can lead to severe complications in the fetus, including hydrops fetalis.
Hydrops fetalis is characterised by fetal oedema, ascites, pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion, often resulting in intrauterine death or neonatal complications.
parvovirus B19 mainly attacks the erythroid progenitor cells and leads to transient arrest of
erythropoiesis. However, immunocompromised individuals are at risk of persistent parvovirus     B19 infection which leads to chronic suppression of bone marrow, resulting in persistent anemia or pure red cell aplasia.
Diagnosing parvovirus B19 infection is primarily based on clinical presentation and confirmed
through serological testing, including detecting specific IgM antibodies. polymerase chain reaction (pcR) assays can also detect viral DNA in blood or other tissues.
The following image shows a slapped cheek appearance seen in Erythema infectiosum (Fifth Disease):


Note: This is a best-out-of-four type of question where all 4 options are factually correct. petechial rash is seen in several viral infections including parvovirus B19 infection. However, the
characteristic rash of this infection is erythematous. This makes option D the best possible answer.",,D,1741-1104.PNG
Q13,"A 5o-year-old patient who underwent a renal transplant recently came with complaints of watery diarrhoea. The stool sample revealed oocysts of size 3ox15 microns. Identify the
organism","a)cyclospora cayatenensis
b)cystoisospora
c)cryptosporidium
d)Microsporidium","The given clinical scenario of a patient with a history of renal transplant and complaints of watery diarrhoea along with  a kinyoun stain positive image of  pink coloured, acid-fast oocyst with the     size of 3ox15 microns is suggestive of infection due to cystoisospora.



cystoisospora usually causes a self-limiting but protracted diarrhoea, lasting for several years,
majorly in immunocompromised persons and particularly among the HIV infected. Human
infection is acquired by ingestion of mature oocysts in food or drink. The parasites generally dwell in the epithelial cells of the small intestine .
Diagnosis involves identifying oocysts in fecal smears, which may sometimes be sparse and
overlooked due to their transparent appearance in unstained films. They stain red using the cold acid-fast technique. concentration methods like zinc sulfate or formol-ether techniques can be     used.
The first line of management for isosporiasis is cotrimoxazole for 7-1o days. patients who do not tolerate cotrimoxazole are treated with nitazoxanide or ciprofloxacin.
A comparison of these coccidian parasites is given in the table below:

property	cryptosporidium	cyclospora	Isospora
Sporulated oocyst	4-6 μm, round contains fo ur sporozoites.	8-12 μm, round contains 2 sporocysts each having t    wo sporozoites.	23-36 μm, oval contains t  wo sporocysts, each havin g four sporozoites
Acid-fast detection	uniformly acid-fast	Variable acid-fast	uniformly acid-fast

Q14,"An 18-day-old baby presents with altered sensorium, and neck rigidity with vesicular lesions on the anterior abdomen and the forearm. The mother revealed a history of treatment for
painful genital ulcers a year ago and the baby was born through vaginal delivery. CSF   examination reveals multinucleate giant cells. which of the following is the most likely involved organism?","a)HSV - 2
b)Coxsackie virus
c)Enterovirus
d)VZV","The given clinical scenario of an 18-day-old child presenting with altered sensorium, neck rigidity, and vesicular lesions on the anterior abdomen and the forearm with the mother giving a history of painful genital ulcers, is suggestive of neonatal herpes due to herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2. cSF     examination with multinucleate giant cells with cNS manifestations indicates neonatal meningitis to the DNA virus.
painful genital ulcers are commonly seen in genital herpes and chancroid due to Hemophilus ducreyi ((ducreyi makes you cry).
Herpes infection can be caused by HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses. HSV-1 causes orofacial lesions, i.e. herpes labialis, while HSV-2 mainly causes genital herpes which is characterised by vesiculo
ulcerative lesions of the penis of the male or of the cervix, vulva, vagina, and perineum of the female.
The typical herpes lesions are thin-walled, umbilicated vesicles, the roof of which breaks down, leaving tiny superficial ulcers which heal without scarring. The most common site of cutaneous lesions is in the face, cheeks, chin, around the mouth and forehead. A cesarean section is
performed in a case of active genital herpes at the time of labour in order to prevent neonatal herpes infection.
one of the following three disease patterns can be seen in infants infected during delivery or in the postpartum period: (1) disease limited to the skin, eyes, or mouth; (2) encephalitis with or
without skin, eye, and mouth disease; or (3) disseminated infection affecting several organs, such



as the brain, lungs, liver, heart, and adrenal glands.
Infants suffering from encephalitis usually exhibit clinical symptoms that point to bacterial
meningitis at 8- 17 days of life. These symptoms include seizures, poor feeding, lethargy, neck
stiffness, irritability, and positive kernig's sign. when left untreated, HSV encephalitis results in 5o% of infant deaths and severe neurologic sequelae in the majority of survivors.
Acyclovir at a high dose of 6o mg/kg/day, administered intravenously every eight hours, should be the first line of treatment for any infant with a confirmed or suspected neonatal HSV infection.
other options:
coxsackie virus, Enterovirus and VzV are not attributed to painful genital ulcers and hence ruled out.",,A,
Q15,which of the following is true with respect to the organism shown below?,"a)Most commonly involves the lungs
b)Associated with budding yeast cells and pseudohyphae
c)only reservoir is man
d)opportunistic infections are seen in patients with CD4 count &lt; 9oo","The above image shows cryptococcus neoformans stained with India ink and its infection most commonly involves the lungs. Indian ink is a type of negative stain that is not picked up by the  capsule, making it evident. Although cryptococcosis usually presents clinically as chronic
meningo-encephalitis, the primary infection always involves the lungs.
cryptococcus is an opportunistic fungus that is found worldwide as a saprophyte in soil enriched with pigeon droppings.
pathogenesis:
• Infection is initiated by inhalation of the yeast cells.
• The primary pulmonary infection may be asymptomatic or may mimic an influenza-like respiratory infection, often resolving spontaneously.
• In immunocompromised, the yeasts may multiply and disseminate to other parts of the body, but preferentially to the cNS, causing cryptococcal meningoencephalitis.
• other common sites of dissemination include the skin, adrenals, bone, eye, and prostate gland.
clinical findings:
• chronic meningitis (Headache, nuchal rigidity, disorientation)
• cSF pressure, protein concentration and cell count are elevated
• cutaneous ulcers, granulomata.
Diagnosis:
• Specimens - cSF, tissue, exudates, sputum, blood, urine, skin scrapings
• Microscopy - Gram staining shows gram-positive round budding yeast cells
• India ink preparation reveals capsulated budding yeast cells; capsules are prominent in this staining.
• culture - colonies on SDA at 37°c appear as smooth, mucoid and creamy white.
• Serology - Demonstration of cryptococcal antigen by latex agglutination test is a sensitive, specific and rapid method for identificcation of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis.



Treatment:
• Cryptococcosis without CNS involvement: Fluconazole is the drug of choice
• HIV patient with CNS involvement: Induction: Liposomal Amphotericin B with Flucytosine for at least 2 weeks
Maintenance: oral Fluconazole
other options:
option B: Cryptococcus neoformans is a round or ovoid budding yeast cell, 4-2o μm in diameter,  with a prominent polysaccharide capsule.Although the fungus grows primarily as a yeast, hyphae  are produced during the sexual phase and during a process called monokaryotic fruiting, which is also believed to involve sexual reproduction, but no pseudohyphae are produced during normal     circumstances.
option C: C.neoformans is frequently found in soils contaminated with avian excreta and can
easily be recovered from shaded and humid soils contaminated with pigeon droppings. Hence, can be found in more than one reservoir other than man.
option D: C.neoformans usually affects patients with advanced HIV infection and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts of as low as &lt;2oo/μL .",1722-1097.PNG,A,
Q16,which of the following is most commonly associated with S.agalactiae ?,"a)Neonatal sepsis
b)pharyngitis with or without tonsillitis
c)Dental caries
d)Endocarditis","S. agalactiae belonging to Group B streptococci are the most common cause of meningitis and neonatal sepsis followed by E. coli.
S. agalactiae is a capsulated Gram-positive coccus occurring in chains. It causes meningitis in the   neonatal period. Infection is commonly acquired from the maternal vagina during birth. There are two clinical types seen in neonates:
• Early-onset type (more common) presents within a week of birth as meningitis or septicemia and is often fatal. Early-onset infection presents similarly to other types of neonatal sepsis, with
common symptoms such as respiratory distress, lethargy, and hypotension. Almost all infants with this condition have bacteremia, while one-third to one-half also experience pneumonia     , respiratory distress syndrome, and one-third develop meningitis.
• Late-onset type presents between the second to twelfth week of life commonly as meningitis, and in most cases is associated with a strain of capsular type III.
Group B streptococci can also lead to infections in non-pregnant immunocompromised adults.
Common infections include sepsis, skin and soft tissue infections, respiratory tract infections, and urinary tract infections in women.
Identification :
A streptococcal isolate can be classified presumptively as GBS based on biochemical tests,
including hydrolysis of sodium hippurate, hydrolysis of bile esculin, and bacitracin susceptibility. The CAMP test (Christie, Atkins and Munch-Peterson) is used to identify group B
β-hemolytic-streptococci based on their ability to form CAMP factor. A characteristic arrowhead zone of hemolysis is seen when Streptococcus agalactiae is inoculated perpendicular to



Staphylococcus aureus grown on blood agar. The group B streptococci hydrolyse sodium hippurate and give a positive CAMP test.

Q18,Assertion (A) - Mycobacterium is detected in sputum samples with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and NaoH. Reason(R) - The sputum samples are treated by NAC to kill commensals and     NaoH to liquefy the sputum.,"a)Assertion(A) is true but Reason(R) is false
b)Both assertion(A) and Reason(R) are true and Reason(R) is the correct explanation of assertion(A)
c)Assertion(A) is false but Reason(R) is true
d)Both assertion(A) and Reason(R) are true but Reason(R) is not the correct explanation of assertion(A)","After sputum sample collection, Mycobacterium is detected in sputum samples with N-acetyl
cysteine (NAC) and NaoH where N-acetyl cysteine is used for liquefaction of sputum and NaoH kills the contaminating bacteria. Therefore in the above question assertion(A) is true but
reason(R) is false.
sputum microscopy is the most reliable single method in the diagnosis and control of
tuberculosis. NALC (N-acetyl cysteine) with 2% NaoH is superior for detecting bacilli in microscopy.
sample collection:
• sputum Collection: sputum yields abundant bacilli in caseation, less in lesions organised lesion not connected to airways. Best collected in the morning pre-meal; scanty samples may be pooled over 24 hours. sampling over three days enhances detection.
• Laryngeal aspiration and bronchial washing is done in situations where sputum is not available
• In children who are unable to expectorate sputum, gastric lavage is an ideal method for sample collection.
Collected sputum and non-sterile samples need initial pre-treatment to prevent microbial
overgrowth during incubation. processes such as liquefaction, decontamination, and
concentration are essential to enhance the yield from the sputum samples. Hence, techniques preserving bacilli viability are necessary. Always follow Class II biosafety methods while
performing any procedures related to sputum.
• petroff's method: In this method, sputum is incubated with 4% sodium hydroxide at 37°C,
shaken till clear (~2o mins), then centrifuged (3ooo rpm, 2o mins). The sediment is neutralised with N/1o HCl for further use. Avoid excessive alkali exposure.
• NALC (N-acetyl cysteine) with 2% NaoH: This method is superior to petroff's, NALC liquefies sputum while NaoH eliminates contaminating bacteria. The sample is then, neutralised with
buffer and centrifugation follows. This method is compatible with automated culture systems.""

Q19,"A gardener in Himachal notices a black ulcer in the right upper arm. Axillary lymph nodes are enlarged and matted. Aspirate from the lymph nodes shows elongated yeats 3-5 micrometres. Mycelium was isolated from the aspirate and grown at 22 degrees Celsius in SDA, and the
image is given below. what is this condition?","a)coccidiomycosis
b)Histoplasmosis
c)sporothrix schenkeii
d)Blastomycosis","The presence of ulcerative eruptions along the lymphatics in a gardener from the sub-Himalayan region and the microscopic finding of flower-like clusters of conidia are suggestive of
sporotrichosis caused by Sporothrix schenckii. It is a thermally dimorphic fungus that lives on vegetation.
The lesions occur following traumatic inoculation of the fungus. A granulomatous nodule is first formed at the site of inoculation and may progress to form a necrotic or ulcerative lesion. The
infection can spread via lymphatic channels from the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the lymph    nodes, resulting in the formation of secondary ulcers on the lymph nodes. This condition is known as lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis. This disease is commonly encountered among gardeners,
forest workers, and manual labourers.
other options:
option A: coccidiomycosis is caused by coccidioides immitis which is a thermally dimorphic
fungus. It occurs as a spherule in tissues and culture at 37°c and as the mycelial form in soil and culture at room temperature. They are endemic to the arid desert regions of the southwestern
USA and california. Infection is acquired by inhaling dust containing arthrospores of the fungus.
option B: Histoplasmosis is caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. It has tiny oval yeast cells with     narrow-based budding within the macrophages with an underlying granulomatous response. This is a dimorphic fungus that exists in the yeast form in body tissues and cultures maintained at
37°c, and in the filamentous mold form in cultures at room temperature (25°c).

b)salmonella enteritis
c)Aeromonas
d)E. coli o157:H7","The given scenario is indicative of hemolytic uremic syndrome, and E. Coli o157:H7 is the likely causative organism.
o157: H7 is a strain of E.coli called enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), which produces
verocytotoxin or shiga-like toxin. They produce two antigenic forms of the cytotoxic toxin known as shiga-like toxin 1 and shiga-like toxin 2. shiga-like toxin 1 is identical to the shiga toxin of
shigella dysenteriae type 1. E. coli o157:H7 has a small infective dose (around 1oo bacilli) and spreads easily from child to child by the fecal-oral route.
It can cause mild non-bloody diarrhoea to hemorrhagic colitis, or a severe form of diarrhoea, with hemolytic uremic syndrome, a disease resulting in acute renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The most common cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in the
world is E.coli o157:H7. The most common cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in India is shigella dysenteriae type I.
EHEC (o157: H7) dysentery is commonly self-limiting, and management is conservative, with the mainstay being the correction of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances and other symptomatic   supportive treatment such as blood transfusion in case of severe blood loss anaemia, but
antibiotics are not to be used. Therefore, the treatment of HUs is primarily supportive care, which may include:
• Intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration
• Blood transfusions to correct anemia and thrombocytopenia
• Dialysis to treat kidney failure
In some cases, plasma exchange or eculizumab may be used to treat HUs. plasma exchange is a procedure that removes harmful substances from the blood. Eculizumab is a medication that
blocks the complement system, which is part of the body's immune system.

Q21,"A long-beaded, filamentous, branching, weakly acid-fast organism is isolated from a lesion caused by trauma to the chest by a blunt farming tool. what is the isolated organism?","a)Bacillus anthrax
b)Listeria
c)Nocardia
d)Mycobacterium tuberculosis","Nocardia is the isolated organism in this patient based on the given histopathological features.
Nocardia species appear as filamentous organisms with extensive hyphae-like branching. They are aerobic, gram-positive, catalase-positive, and urease-positive. They are weakly acid-fast because
they stain with carbolfuchsin and retain when decolourized with 1–4% sulfuric acid instead of the stronger acid-alcohol decolorant.
Infections caused by Nocardia include cutaneous, subcutaneous, or systemic lesions. It may lead  to local abscesses, cellulitis, or lymphocutaneous lesions. systemic nocardiosis occurs more often in immunodeficient persons.
Infection follows traumatic inoculation of the organism into the subcutaneous tissue from soil or    vegetable sources. They can present with a characteristic powdery substance that appears as gritty or necrotic material on the skin or within soft tissues. Accompanying this are multiple discharging sinuses, which are abnormal openings that form as the body attempts to expel infected material.    These sinuses can drain purulent, often foul-smelling discharge typically associated with localised  abscesses, and the discharge may be viscous, sometimes containing necrotic tissue.
systemic nocardiosis usually caused by N.asteroides manifests primarily as pulmonary disease,
pneumonia, lung abscess, or other lesions resembling tuberculosis. Extrapulmonary manifestation may involve the brain, kidneys, and other organs.
Diagnosis is by microscopy of sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, and tissue biopsy.
Gram stain shows beaded gram-positive filamentous rods. In Modified ZN staining they are weakly acid-fast.
The drug of choice for nocardiosis is cotrimoxazole. In severe cases, 3rd generation
cephalosporins/ carbapenems and amikacin are recommended.

c)PD-1 on T cell interacts with PD ligand 1 on APC
d)Cytokine mediated proliferation and differentiation","PD-1 on T cell interacts with PD ligand 1 on APC is not true regarding naive T cell interaction with CD4 effector T-cells.
T-cell activation requires two signals that are delivered by APCs (option A). They include:
• Antigens displayed by APCs in the form of peptides bound to MHC molecules, that are recognised by T-cell receptors
• Costimulatory signal (as it stimulates T cells in conjunction with antigen) provided by molecules on APCs that engage particular costimulatory receptors on T cells



CD8o (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) are the costimulatory molecules present on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). They bind to the CD28 protein present on T cells (option B). This promotes the expansion of antigen-stimulated T cells and their differentiation into effector and memory cells. (option D).",,C,
Q23,which of the following is a method of antibiotic sensitivity testing?,"a)E test
b)Elek test
c)Latex agglutination test
d)CAMP test","E-test is a method of antibiotic sensitivity testing.
E-test (epsilometer) is a diffusion and dilution method of testing antibiotic sensitivity. It is a quantitative technique for determining antimicrobial susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
An absorbent strip containing a predefined gradient (serial dilution) of antibiotic concentration immobilized along its length is placed on a lawn inoculum of a bacterium. An elliptical zone of  inhibition is produced surrounding the strip. The antibiotic concentration at which the ellipse    edge intersects the strip is taken as the MIC value.
The given image shows the E-test.





The antibiotic sensitivity tests are classified as follows:
1. Diffusion methods:
• Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method
• stokes disk diffusion metho
2. Dilution methods:
• Broth dilution

option C: In latex agglutination tests, an antigen-specific antibody (either polyclonal or
monoclonal) is fixed to latex beads. when the clinical specimen from the patient is added to a
suspension of the latex beads, the antibodies bind to the antigens on the microorganism forming a lattice structure, and agglutination of the beads occurs. Latex agglutination tests are mainly used   for the detection of carbohydrate antigens of encapsulated microorganisms.


option D: The Christie-Atkins-Munch-Peterson (CAMP) test is used to identify group B,
β-streptococci based on their ability to form CAMP factor, which causes synergistic hemolysis
with β-hemolysin formed by staphylococcus aureus. when streptococcus agalactiae is inoculated   perpendicular to staphylococcus aureus grown on blood agar, a characteristic arrowhead zone of   hemolysis is seen.

b)Curvularia
c)Coccidioides immitis
d)Aspergillus fumigatus","Madurella mycetomatis is transmitted by walking barefoot in soil. It causes Eumycetoma.
Mycetoma is a chronic, granulomatous infection of the skin, subcutaneous tissues, fascia, and bone, which most often affects the foot or the hand. It can be divided into three types-
eumycetomas, actinomycetomas, and botryomycosis.
Infection follows traumatic inoculation of the organism into the subcutaneous tissue from soil or    vegetable sources. within host tissues, the organisms develop to form compacted colonies (grains) o.5–2 mm in diameter, the colour of which depends on the organism responsible. It results in
tumefactions, deformities, and draining sinuses, discharging these grains or granules.
Laboratory Diagnosis:
A. Direct Examination: The presence of grains in pus collected from draining sinuses or in biopsy material is diagnostic.
B. culture samples should also be cultured, at both 25–3o°c and 37°c, on brain-heart infusion agar or blood agar for actinomycetes and on sabouraud agar (without cycloheximide) for fungi.
Treatment:
The management of eumycetoma is difficult, involving surgical debridement or excision and
chemotherapy. Actinomycetoma, on the other hand, responds well to rifampicin in combination with sulfonamides or cotrimoxazole.

c)High larval load can cause rectal prolapse
d)unembryonated eggs in stool are not infective and embryonated eggs in soil are infective","A high larval load can cause rectal prolapse is not true regarding Ascaris lumbricoides.
Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm) reside in the small intestine and not the large intestine to cause rectal prolapse. Trichuris Trichura (whipworm) cause rectal prolapse.



Ascaris lumbricoides is an intestinal nematode that causes ascariasis. Infection occurs through
food or water contaminated with nightsoil or human faeces having eggs of Ascaris that contain the infective rhabditiform larva. Man is the only natural host. There is no intermediate host. Most
infected humans are asymptomatic. (option A)
The life cycle is as follows:
• Adult worms live in the lumen of the small intestine. A female produces eggs, which are passed with the faeces.
• unfertilized eggs in the stool may be ingested but are not infective. The infective form of Ascaris is the embryonated egg in the soil (option D). Infection typically arises from consuming food or     water contaminated with embryonated eggs. These eggs harbour the rhabditiform larva.
• After infective eggs are swallowed, the larvae hatch.
• The larvae invade the intestinal mucosa and are carried through the portal system, then systemic circulation to the lungs.
• The larvae mature further in the lungs (1o to 14 days), penetrate the alveolar walls, ascend the bronchial tree to the throat, and are swallowed. This may present with asthma-like symptoms    (option B).
• upon reaching the small intestine, they develop into adult worms. Between 2 and 3 months are required from ingestion of the infective eggs to oviposition by the adult female.
• Adult worms can live for 1 to 2 years.
• Adult worms can be occasionally detected in the stool or sputum of the patient. A definitive diagnosis is made by demonstration of eggs in faeces. Fertilised eggs are always bile-stained.
Effective and safe drugs for the treatment of ascariasis are pyrantel pamoate 11 mg/kg once, Albendazole 4oo mg once, Mebendazole 1oo mg twice daily for 3 days, Ivermectin 15o-2oo mcg/kg once.

Dogs are the definitive hosts of E. granulosus. sheep are the usual intermediate hosts, but humans are accidental intermediate hosts. Humans are end-stage hosts of the parasite since there is no
human-to-human transmission.
Approximately 75% of hydatid cysts are located in the right lobe of the liver and are solitary. The   clinical presentation of a hydatid cyst is largely asymptomatic until complications occur. The most common presenting symptoms are abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and vomiting. The most frequent    sign is hepatomegaly.
The life cycle of Echinococcus is depicted in the image below:





The hydatid cyst wall consists of 3 layers:
• pericyst- the outer dense fibrous capsule that is formed as a result of host inflammatory response.
• Ectocyst - the intermediate layer consisting of acellular, chitinous, laminated hyaline material.
• Endocyst - the inner germinal layer that is cellular and consists of several nuclei embedded in
protoplasmic mass and is extremely thin. It is the vital layer of the cyst, and it is the site of asexual reproduction, giving rise to brood capsules with scolices.
The brood capsules are cellular masses in the hydatid fluid, which consists of scoleces. In a
definitive host, these scoleces develop into adult tapeworms, while in the intermediate hosts,
these develop into new hydatid cysts. The brood capsules are attached to the endocyst by a pedicle or stalk.
The brood capsules may mature and detach from the mother cyst and become the daughter cysts, which are replicas of the mother cysts. The freed brood capsules and scoleces present in the
hydatid fluid are called hydatid sand.





other options:
option B: Hymenolepis nana (dwarf tapeworm) is the smallest tapeworm. Humans are the
definitive host. It has no intermediate host. It occurs more commonly in children, and the patient acquires this infection by ingesting food or water contaminated with eggs. The egg attaches to the intestine and develops into the larva and adult worm. The adult worm resides in the small
intestine. Patients are usually asymptomatic. However, in heavy infections, they present with
nausea, anorexia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and irritability. Pruritus may also be present due to an allergic response.
option C: Taenia solium is a parasitic tapeworm transmitted through undercooked pork, causing intestinal infection (taeniasis) or more severe cyst formation in tissues, including the brain
(cysticercosis). It's prevalent in regions with poor sanitation and where pork is consumed.
option D: Taenia saginata is a parasitic tapeworm transmitted through undercooked beef containing cysticerci (“measly” beef). Humans are the definitive host, and cows are the
intermediate hosts. Taenia solium and Taenia saginata eggs are morphologically
indistinguishable.",1729-1099.PNG,A,Picture5.png
Q36,which of the following drugs is not given in uncomplicated falciparum malaria?,"a)chloroquine
b)primaquine
c)Arthemeter
d)pyrimethamine sulfadoxine","Chloroquine is not given in uncomplicated falciparum malaria.
NVBDCP guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum cases:
• North-eastern states: Artemether-lumefantrine-based ACT (option C)
• Rest of the country: Artesunate-sulfadoxine+pyrimethamine (option D)
The artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) recommended by NVBDCP in the northeastern states is a combination of artemether and lumefantrine. In the northeastern states (Arunachal
Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura), the presently recommended ACT for P. falciparum malaria is a fixed-dose combination of
artemether-lumefantrine due to the recent reports of late treatment failures with the current



combination of As+sp.
primaquine o.75 mg/kg on day 2 is given as a single dose in uncomplicated falciparum malaria.(option B)",,A,
Q37,How do you sterilise bacteriological loops used for inoculation?,"a)Heat till metal turns red hot
b)pass over flame 3 times
c)Autoclave
d)Microwave","Bacteriological loops used for inoculation are sterilised by heating till metal turns red hot.
sterilisation of bacteriological inoculating loops, the tip of spatulas and forceps is done by placing them over a Bunsen flame until they get red hot. Inoculation loops carrying infective material
should be dipped in a disinfectant before flaming to prevent spattering.
other options:
option B: Disinfection of slides and cover slips are done by passing over the flame 3 times.
option C: Autoclaving is a method of heat sterilisation. The autoclave is a device that uses steam under pressure to sterilise linen, instruments, laboratory ware, media, pharmaceutical products, aqueous solutions, surgical instruments, cardiac catheters, and implants.
option D: In Microwave irradiation, microorganisms are killed using high-frequency microwaves. This cannot be used for animal or human body parts, metal items or toxic or radioactive material.",,A,
