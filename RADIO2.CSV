Q1,A child presents with history of having ingested a button battery. what is your next course of action?,"a)Give oral fluids
b)Remove endoscopically
c)Reassure and to check whether passed in stools
d)Induce vomiting","This case should be managed by removing the button battery endoscopically after confirming its position on X-Ray.
Button battery ingestion causes alkaline caustic injury, more in the areas surrounding the negative pole.
Management :
• The child is to be kept NPO until the oesophageal position of the battery is ruled out by X-ray scan. vomiting should never be induced since the battery, which has passed through the
esophagus, might lodge back again into it. Reassurance can be done only if the position of the battery is confirmed and if there are no symptoms.
• since the question does not mention that the child is asymptomatic, the management of choice would be removing the battery endoscopically.
• Management also depends on battery life. Fresh batteries need to be removed as soon as possible as they have a higher concentration of injurious substances.",,B,
Q2,which of the following statements are false regarding X Rays?,"a)Loss of soft tissue planes is the earliest X-ray change of infection b) Glass pieces can be seen in X-ray images.
b)Joint space is a misnomer as there is no real space in the joint.
c)Live bone is more radio-opaque than dead bone on X- Ray images.","Live bone is not more radio-opaque than dead bone on X-ray images.
In fact, dead bone looks more white (more radio-opaque) than live bone on X-Ray as there's no bone resorption activity.
Loss of soft tissue planes is the earliest X-ray change in infections and is seen 24-48 hours after the onset of disease.
Joint space in X-rays is the radiolucency of cartilage being apparently perceived as space.
Glass pieces can be seen on X-ray images as they contain lead.",,D,
Q3,"A child presented with a history of road traffic accident. The axial CT image of the child, shown below, is suggestive of_________","a)Extradural Hemorrhage
b)subdural Hemorrhage
c)subarachnoid Hemorrhage
d)Intraventricular Hemorrhage","The given CT image shows the typical bi-convex hyperdense lesion not crossing cranial sutures, characteristic of an extradural hemorrhage.



As the dura mater tends to adhere to the skull, the hematoma collecting between the skull and this dura is seen on CT sections as a biconvex dense area immediately beneath the skull vault, convex   towards both the brain and the vault. They tend not to cross the suture lines.
The temporoparietal convexity is the most common site. The hematoma usually lies beneath a    fracture of the squamous part of the temporal bone. The underlying brain is displaced but often appears intrinsically normal.
Monitoring an extradural hemorrhage and immediate intervention if necessary is an important step in management since the brain can herniate with increased bleeding that is causing raised ICp.",3881-2437.PNG,A,
Q4,A 39-year-old male patient presented with complaints of fever and cough. His chest radiograph shows air bronchogram sign. The probable diagnosis is :,"a)pleural effusion
b)consolidation
c)Hilar lymphadenopathy
d)Bronchiectasis","The radiograph shows air bronchogram sign in a lung with consolidation, seen in pneumonia, which is supported by the clinical history of this patient.
An air bronchogram is a tubular outline of an airway made visible when there is filling of the surrounding alveoli by fluid or inflammatory exudates.
The causes of air bronchogram are as follows:
• Lung consolidation
• pulmonary edema
• Nonobstructive pulmonary atelectasis
• severe interstitial disease
• Neoplasm
• Normal expiration
pleural effusion is seen as a homogenous opacity on chest radiograph.
The given radiograph shows peribronchial thickening and air bronchogram sign:",,B,3886-2441.PNG;3887-2443.PNG
Q5,The Doppler waveform of the venous blood flow in lower limb DVT is _____.,"a)Monophasic
b)Biphasic
c)Triphasic
d)Multiphasic","The Doppler waveform of the venous blood flow in lower limb DVT is monophasic proximal to the level of obstruction.
The normal venous waveform shows a variation (phasicity) secondary to respiration referred to as respirophasic waveform. Loss of this phasic variation results in a monophasic waveform
suggestive of venous obstruction proximal to the level of interrogation.
A normal artery has a triphasic signal. The waveform becomes biphasic in mild-moderate stenosis and monophasic in severe stenosis.
The image given below shows the normal triphasic signal from an artery.




Monophasic waveform:",,A,3887-2442.PNG;3888-2444.PNG
Q6,"A middle-aged female patient with a history of cholelithiasis, presented with vomiting and abdominal pain. The abdominal radiograph showed Rigler’s triad. which of these is not a  component of Rigler’s triad?","a)pneumobilia
b)small bowel obstruction
c)Ectopic gall stone
d)Large bowel obstruction","Rigler’s triad is seen in gallstone ileus and consists of
• pneumobilia
• small bowel obstruction
• Ectopic gall stone (usually in the right iliac fossa)
This should not be confused with Rigler’s sign and Rigler's notch sign.
Rigler's sign:
seen in pneumoperitoneum. Here, the air is seen on both sides of the bowel wall unlike normally, where the air is seen only in the intraluminal side of the bowel.
Rigler's notch sign:
Refers to indentation seen in the border of a solid lung mass, which is thought to represents a     feeding vessel, thus suggesting the presence of bronchial carcinoma. But, this is not specific and can also be seen in granulomatous infections.",,D,
Q7,All among the following are ionizing radiations except:,"a)Alpha rays
b)Beta rays
c)X-rays
d)MRI","MRI is a technique that produces topographic images by means of magnetic fields and
radiofrequency waves.
The ionizing radiations
• Alpha
• Beta



• Gamma
• X-Rays
The non-Ionizing radiations are:
• Radiofrequency waves
• Uv rays
• Microwaves
Alpha and beta rays are particulate radiation (particles) whereas gamma and x-rays are
electromagnetic rays. All electromagnetic waves have a constant velocity of 3×108 m/s and no mass. The electromagnetic spectrum, from low frequency to high frequency consists of:
Radiowaves &lt; Microwaves &lt; Infrared &lt; visible light &lt; Ultraviolet &lt; X-rays &lt; Gamma rays
Note: W. C. Roentgen is the father of X-ray and the first medical X-ray by Roentgen was of his wife Anna Bertha's left hand. physicists peter Mansfield and paul Lauterbur developed
MRI-related imaging techniques in medicine and they were awarded the Nobel prize in 2003.",,D,
Q8,Empty thecal sac sign on MRI is seen in:,"a)Arachnoiditis
b)Discitis
c)vertebral osteomyelitis
d)Tethered cord syndrome","An empty thecal sac sign is seen in arachnoiditis.
Adhesive arachnoiditis can be diagnosed if the empty thecal sac indication is observed. This
occurs due to inflammation, which leads to clumping of nerve roots. This leads to an empty sac
appearance. It is best observed on T2-weighted MRI scans ofthe lumbar spine when the thecal sac appears empty.",,A,3889-2445.PNG
Q9,"From the X-ray given, pick out the probable diagnosis:","a)subdiaphragmmatic abscess
b)pneumothorax
c)pneumoperitoneum
d)Intestinal obstruction","The above X-ray clearly shows the presence of subdiaphragmatic free gas in the right upper quadrant. This indicates pneumoperitoneum.
pneumoperitoneum is the presence of free gas within the peritoneal cavity but outside the viscera. The most common cause of pneumoperitoneum is bowel perforation.
• Gastric and posterior duodenal perforations are seen in long-standing cases of peptic ulcers.
• Intestinal perforations are seen with ischemia, inflammation, diverticula, or obstruction.
• other causes also include iatrogenic, penetrating injuries, prolonged mechanical ventilation, peritoneal dialysis, etc.
signs of pneumoperitoneum:
• Bowel-related signs
• Double wall sign/Rigler's sign/gas-relief sign- Air is seen on both sides of the bowel wall.
• Telltale triangle sign/triangle sign - Triangle of gas formed between three loops of the bowel or between the abdominal wall and two loops ofthe bowel.
• peritoneal ligament-related signs
• Football sign- Air outlines the confines of the peritoneal cavity
• Falciform ligament sign-  Air outlines the falciform ligament
• Lateral umbilical ligament sign/inverted ""v"" sign- Air outlines the lateral umbilical ligament
• urachus sign - Air outlines the urachus
• Right upper quadrant signs
• cupola sign- Air outlines the median subphrenic space
• Fissure for ligamentum teres sign- Air outlines the ligamentum teres
• Hepatic edge sign- cigar-shaped free-air pocket in the subhepatic region. It tracks superomedial following the contours of the liver
• Lucent liver sign - Reduction of hepatic radiodensity due to accumulation of free gas anterior to the liver
• Morison's pouch sign / Doge cap sign - Triangular/ crescentic gas lucency bound by the 11th rib
• periportal free gas sign.",3883-2439.PNG,C,
Q10,what is the diagnosis shown in the image below?,"a)costochondritis
b)spondylolisthesis
c)cervical rib
d)Rib fracture","The given X-ray shows cervical rib.
patients with a cervical rib usually show a lump and tenderness in the supraclavicular fossa. The    pallor and paresthesias are due to vascular and neural compressions respectively. A radiograph of the neck is useful in detecting a cervical rib.
However, the absence of a rib on the x-ray does not rule out the possibility of a cervical rib. cT and MRI are more sensitive.",3883-2438.PNG,C,3891-2446.PNG
Q11,Identify the procedure.,"a)Myelography
b)Angiography
c)DEXA
d)projectional radiography","The procedure depicted in the image represents myelography.
Myelography is a procedure used to evaluate spinal conditions. X-ray myelography can be used to evaluate the spinal canal in patients with spondylolisthesis. while MRI has largely replaced X-ray myelography it is done when there is a contraindication to MRI (Eg; non-compatible pacemaker,   severe claustrophobia).
