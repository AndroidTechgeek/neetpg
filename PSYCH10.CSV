Q1,which of the following is false about bipolar disorder?,"a)Type 1 is common in both sexes
b)prevalence in general population is 1-2%
c)Attempt to commit suicide is seen around 15% of people","The false statement among the following is option A. The age of onset for bipolar type I disorder  ranges from, children of age 5 or 6 years to adults of age 5o years or older, with a mean age of 18



years. The mean age of onset for bipolar type II is 2o years.
patients with bipolar disorder can present with both manic and depressive episodes or with manic episodes alone. The bipolar disorder presented with mania and depression for at least a week is
known as bipolar type 1 disorder. whereas, if it is presented with hypomania and depression it is
known as bipolar type 2 disorder.
The lifetime prevalence of bipolar type 1 disorder is o to 2.4%, whereas bipolar type 2 disorder is o.3-4.8%. Bipolar type 1 disorder has an equal prevalence among men and women. suicide
attempt is seen in around 15% of people with bipolar disorder.
A manic episode is defined as a persistent elevated, expansive, or irritable mood for at least 1 week which requires hospitalization. A hypomanic episode is also similar to a manic episode except it
doesn't cause social and occupational functioning impairment. It lasts for at least 4 days and doesn't show psychotic symptoms.
A person is said to be depressed if he has at least four of the following symptoms for at least 2 weeks:
• change in appetite and weight
• change in sleep and activity
• Lack of energy
• Guilty feeling
• recurring thoughts about death or suicide.
Lithium is used for the pharmacological management of bipolar disorder.",,A,

Q3,"A patient diagnosed with schizophrenia was started on risperidone. After taking the
medication last night, the patient rushes to OpD today with complaints of upwards rolling of his eyes. what is the management of the condition?","a)Lorazepam
b)promethazine
c)Olanzapine
d)stop antipsychotic","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of oculogyric crisis and promethazine is used for the management.
oculogyric crisis refers to the spasm of the extraocular muscles, usually causing upward and
outward deviation of the eyes. It is a severe form of acute dystonia, an extrapyramidal side effect of antipsychotics like risperidone. It can be treated by drugs with antimuscarinic activities like
promethazine.
Dystonia is acute in onset and occurs within 1-5 days of starting treatment. It is more common in the younger population. The proposed mechanism of action is D2 blockade in the nigrostriatal
pathway. There is typical involvement of head and neck muscles and presents in a variety of   forms, such as torticollis, trismus, mouth opening dystonia, grimacing, dysarthria, oculogyric crisis, blepharospasm, and swallowing difficulties.
Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic with D2 blocking but strong 5HT2 antagonistic
activity. Its main side effects include weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperprolactinemia,
dyslipidemia, fatigue, etc. At low doses, extrapyramidal side effects are less, but can be significant in higher doses. Extrapyramidal side effects include;
• parkinsonism: Features are bradykinesia, rigidity, variable tremor, masked facies, and shuffling gait.
• Acute dystonia: which causes spasms of muscles of the tongue, face, eyes, neck, back, etc.
• Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: Extreme rigidity, fever, unstable blood pressure,myoglobinemia, etc.
• Rabbit syndrome: perioral tremors occur as a delayed variant of parkinsonism.
other options:
option A: Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine. Its adverse effects include sedation, light-headedness, confusional state, weight gain, etc.
option C: olanzapine is also an atypical antipsychotic. Its adverse effects are dry mouth, constipation, weight gain, impaired glucose tolerance etc.",,B,
Q4,which of the following disease is exclusively seen in females?,"a)Rett syndrome
b)Asperger syndrome
c)selective mutism
d)Atypical autism","Rett syndrome is exclusively seen in females. It is caused by X-linked dominant inheritance and hence affects only females, as most males die in utero.
Rett syndrome is a form of autism spectrum disorder. The child is normal at birth, but by 1 year of age deterioration in communication skills, motor behaviour, and social functioning are noticed.
symptoms are ataxia, loss of speech, teeth grinding, and facial grimacing. when the child is awake, intermittent hyperventilation and disorganized breathing pattern are observed.
stereotypical hand movements like hand-wringing, are characteristically seen. progressive gait disturbance and seizures are seen. Decreased pigmentation of the substantia nigra, along with  cerebral atrophy occurs, implying an abnormal dopaminergic nigrostriatal system.
other options:
option B: Asperger syndrome is a version of autism spectrum disorder. It is characterized by limited social interaction and restricted interest and behaviour. There is no delay in language



development.
option C: selective mutism is a social anxiety disorder. The child hesitates to speak in one or more social settings, mostly the school.
option D: Atypical autism is autism, atypical either in the age of onset or in symptomology or both.",,A,
Q5,Match the following:,"a)1-D, 2- B, 3-A, 4-C
b)1-C, 2-B, 3-D, 4-A
c)1-C, 2-D, 3-B, 4-A

Impulse control disorders are characterized by the repeated failure to resist an impulse, drive, or urge to perform an act that is rewarding to the person, at least in the short-term, despite
consequences such as long-term harm either to the individual or to others; marked distress about the behavior pattern; or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
It includes
• pyromania
• kleptomania
• Compulsive sexual behavior disorder
• Intermittent explosive disorder
kleptomania is the repeated failure to resist impulses to steal objects that are of no value to the
person. The individual can usually afford the object or does not need it, but it is the act of stealing itself that is the goal. The stolen objects are usually given away, returned, or kept hidden. The act  is not planned and is carried out alone.
pyromania is the deliberate setting of fires on more than one occasion.
pyromania is significantly associated with the following:
• substance abuse disorder (especially alcoholism).
• Affective disorders (depression or bipolar)
• other impulse control disorders, such as kleptomania in female firesetters.
• personality disturbances, such as borderline personality disorders.
• Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and learning disabilities in childhood pyromania.
Dipsomania is an irresistible impulse to drink alcohol at a periodic intervals.
Mutilomania is an irresistible impulse to mutilate animals.",,C,
Q6,"A 14-year-old girl presented with sudden-onset blindness for the past 4 hours. However, on
history taking, it is noted that she is not concerned about it. However, she is concerned that    her mother passed away recently and that she should have spent more time with her. physical examination findings are normal. which of the following is true about the condition?","a)In children, equally among males and females.
b)In adults, equally among males and females.
c)In adults, occurs more in males than in females.
d)In children, occurs more in females than in males.","The above scenario is suggestive of conversion disorder. option D is a true statement regarding the above condition as it is more commonly seen in females.



conversion disorder is also called functional neurological symptom disorder, and there is no
bodily cause involved in this condition. A conversion disorder is an acute and temporary loss or     alteration in motor or sensory function triggered by psychosocial stress. Most of the patients have a history of traumatic events in childhood. The symptoms or deficits of conversion disorder
are not intentionally produced but are a symbolic representation of an unconscious conflict (primary gain). It is more commonly seen in females.
primary gain refers to keeping internal conflicts outside of awareness and the relief from stress.    secondary gain refers to the attention gained by the patient (from bystanders) as a result of being sick. If the secondary gain is intentional, then it would lead to the diagnosis of malingering. A
related phenomenon is la belle indifference, in which the patient is not concerned about the serious symptoms.
symptoms of conversion disorder:
• Mutism, blindness, and paralysis are the most common symptoms.
• sensory system: Anesthesia, paresthesia, deafness, blindness, and tunnel vision
• Motor system: Abnormal movements, gait disturbance (astasia abasia), weakness, paralysis, tics, jerks, etc.
• cNs: pseudo-seizures
Treatment: Hypnosis, anxiolytics, and behavioral relaxation exercises are effective. psychoanalysis and insight-oriented psychotherapy help in the resolution of the symptoms.",,D,
Q7,what is the dose range of lithium in mEq/L for acute attacks of mania and long-term maintenance?,"a)o.5 to 1 mEq/L
b)o.1 to o.5 mEq/L
c)o.6 to 1.5 mEq/L
d)2 to 3 mEq/L","Dose range of lithium in mEq/L for acute attacks of mania and long-term maintenance is o.6 to
1.5 mEq/L
Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index (o.8 to 1.2 mEq/L) and, therefore, requires monitoring to  suspect toxicity. The toxic effects of lithium usually start manifesting when the serum level crosses 1.5 mEq/L.
The range of 1.o-1.5 mEq/L is only favoured for acute attacks of mania with lower doses of o.6-1.o mEq/L for long term maintainance.
Acute intoxication is characterized by
• vomiting
• profuse diarrhea
• coarse tremors
• Ataxia
• coma
• convulsions.
A fine action tremor is common in patients taking lithium at therapeutic doses and can develop at any time during treatment. Therapeutic lithium tremor is generally symmetric, limited to the
arms, and nonprogressive. The tremor from lithium toxicity is coarser and more disabling, may



also affect the legs, and occurs with other symptoms of toxicity.
serious effects of lithium toxicity will involve confusion, hyperreflexia, and seizures. Motor and
cognitive adverse effects can become irreversible, with persistent cerebellar tremor being the most common.",,C,
Q8,"A patient who is a chronic alcoholic presents with seizures and altered sensorium. He has
been drinking for the past 1o years and takes 24 units per day. His last drink was 2 days back. He is found to have auditory hallucinations and secondary delusions. what will you use for
the management of this patient?","a)1,4
b)1,2,4
c)1,3,4
d)1,2","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of delirium tremens. Management of this patient involves the administration of diazepam and thiamine.
Delirium tremens is the most severe form of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. It occurs usually within 3–4 days of alcohol withdrawal.
characteristic features of delirium tremens:
• clouding of consciousness, with disorientation to time and place
• poor attention and distractibility
• visual hallucinations and illusions, which are often vivid and very frightening
• Autonomic disturbances like tachycardia, fever, hypertension, diaphoresis, and pupillary dilatation
• psychomotor agitation and ataxia
Benzodiazepines such as diazepam (intravenously) or chlordiazepoxide (orally every 4 hours) are    given. It is also recommended to administer thiamine in patients with alcohol-related disorders to prevent wernicke-korsakoff syndrome.
Acute alcohol intoxication can be treated with the evacuation of stomach and bowel and gastric
lavage with an alkaline solution. Administration of 1 L of normal saline with 1o% glucose, 1oo mg thiamine, and 15 U insulin may be useful. If the coma progresses deeper, stimulants like
strychnine and caffeine can be used. patients should be started on artificial respiration if there is respiratory depression or difficulty breathing.
chronic alcohol intoxication can be treated with disulfiram (daily dose of 25o mg OD),
conditioned reflex treatment, hypnosis, and psychotherapy.
According to the Motor vehicle Amendment bill (2o19), whoever while driving, or attempting to drive, a motor vehicle, has, in his/her blood, alcohol exceeding 3o mg/1oo mL of blood, detected in a test by a breath analyzer, is punishable by law.
Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist which is used along with cognitive behavioral therapy in cases of opioid withdrawal and alcohol withdrawal. It reduces craving and consumption, also     reduces the severity of withdrawal symptoms.
Flupenthixol is an antipsychotic antagonist of both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors. The depot injections are used for the management of schizophrenia and depression.",,D,

Paraphilias or perversions are sexual stimuli or acts that are deviations from normal sexual behaviors but are necessary for some people to experience arousal and orgasm.
Eonism (also known as transvestism) is a sexual perversion, where a person's whole personality is dominated by a desire to be identified as a member of the opposite sex. This is usually seen in
males who obtain sexual pleasure by wearing female clothes. There is no hormonal/genital abnormality.
Exhibitionism is the urge to expose genitals to a stranger or unsuspecting person.
Frotteurism refers to the sexual gratification achieved by touching or rubbing against a non-consenting person. This behavior often occurs in busy and crowded places. It is
predominantly described in men.
Necrophilia is an obsession with obtaining sexual gratification from dead bodies.

Q11,A pregnant mother was on SSRIs. The risk of which of the following is increased in the newborn?,"a)A, C
b)A, B, C, D
c)B, C, D
d)A, B, C","The newborn of a pregnant mother on SSRI has an increased risk for A, B, C and D. SSRIs like   sertraline are the most commonly used antidepressants to treat depression in pregnant women.
SSRIs and maternal depression have both been found to cause a low APGAR score.
The development of ADHD in the newborn has been found to be commonly associated with
untreated maternal depression. But studies regarding SSRIs having a causal association with the development of ADHD have been inconclusive. This can be contributed to maternal depression    being a confounder.
When used in the second half of pregnancy, SSRIs have been associated with an increased risk of precipitating persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn.



There has been evidence of a transient delay in developmental milestones in patients who were    exposed to SSRIs during pregnancy. Most studies have observed that the development returns to normal after some time. But if the mother is severely depressed, delayed developmental
milestones have also been attributed to the mother's disinterest in the infant.
The other side effects of SSRIs include:

System	Side effects of SSRIs
Sexual	Anorgasmia, Decreased libid o
Gastrointestinal ( 5-HT3 rece ptor)	Nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, v omiting, flatulence, and dysp epsia
Nervous system	Extremelyvivid dreamsor nig  htmares, Anxiety, Insomnia/s edation, seizures, emotional   blunting
