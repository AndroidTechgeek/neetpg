Q1,which of the following is a true statement about congenital CMV infection?,"a)About 2o-3o% of the infections are symptomatic
b)Triad of SNHL, periventricular calcification and enamel hypoplasia
c)Most children asymptomatic at birth can develop conductive hearing loss later in life
d)If mother is IgG positive for CMV, the child is unlikely to develop infection","If the mother is IgG positive for CMV, then the child is unlikely to develop the infection.
In one-third of mothers who develop a primary infection during pregnancy, the virus gets
transmitted to the fetus. In previously infected mothers with IgG antibodies, only 1-3% would transmit the virus to the fetus.
Most CMV transmission occurs in the first trimester. The risk of transmission is high in
the third trimester. only 1o% of infants with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic (option A).
Hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, and petechiae constitute the clinical triad (option B) in congenital
CMV. Neuroimaging shows intracranial periventricular calcifications. other manifestations include IUGR, hydrops, microcephaly, pneumonitis, chorioretinitis, seizures, sensorineural hearing loss, abnormal dentition, and hypocalcified enamel.
About half of the symptomatic infants develop long-term sequelae which include sensorineural
hearing loss (SNHL), vision loss, seizure disorders, mental retardation, and developmental delay. But in asymptomatic infants, only about 13.5% develop long-term sequelae which is commonly     SNHL (option C).
The investigation of choice is PCR or viral culture. It should be done within the first two to three weeks of life. After this period, it is difficult to distinguish between a congenital and an acquired  infection. Since not all affected infants are viremic at birth, urine and/or saliva are more
reliable samples than blood.
There is no definitive treatment for congenital CMV infection. Treatment
with ganciclovir is indicated only in patients with progressive neurologic disease and deafness.",,D,
Q2,which of the following are components of kangaroo mother care?,"a)Early discharge, skin to skin contact, exclusive breastfeeding
b)Skin to skin contact, exclusive breastfeeding, prevent infection
c)Early discharge, exclusive breastfeeding and prevent infection","The four components of kangaroo mother care (KMC) are skin-to-skin positioning of the baby on the mother's (or caretaker’s) chest, exclusive breastfeeding, early discharge and ambulatory care, and support for the mother and her family for taking care of the baby.
Eligibility criteria for KMC include all hemodynamically stable low birthweight (LBW) babies. All mothers without any serious illness can provide KMC. Short sessions of KMC can be initiated in   babies on medical treatment like IV fluids or oxygen therapy.
The initiation of KMC can differ depending on the weight of the newborn. Babies weighing less
than 12oo g at birth may require several days to weeks before KMC can begin. For babies
weighing between 12oo g and 18oo g, the initiation of KMC may only take a few days. KMC can be started immediately after birth for babies weighing over 18oo g.



The baby should be placed between the mother's breasts in an upright position, with the face
turned to one side, The hips are abducted and flexed in a 'frog position' and the arms are also
flexed. The abdomen of the baby should be at the level of the mother's epigastrium. In this
position, the mother's breathing would stimulate the baby and prevent the development of apnea.
KMC is not necessary once the baby attains 25oo g of weight or 37 weeks of gestation.
The image below shows proper KMC positioning:


The duration of KMC should be gradually increased from short sessions of more than one hour to
24 hours a day.
KMC is comparable to incubators in terms of safety and thermal protection as evidenced by mortality rates. Additionally, it has been shown to reduce severe morbidity by facilitating
breastfeeding.
KMC promotes the bonding between mother and child, fostering a strong emotional connection during the early stages of life.
Note: Incubatory care, feeding via nasal catheter, and prevention of infection are part of intensive care for low birthweight babies.",,B,5618-3576.PNG
Q3,which of the following is given as a part of the therapy for a child with severe COVID?,"a)Corticosteroids
b)Ivermectin
c)Remdesivir
d)All of the above","Among the given options, only corticosteroids are given for children with severe COVID-19.
Severe COVID-19 infection is defined as SpO2 &lt;9o% on room air with any of the following      findings: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), signs of severe pneumonia, septic shock,  multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) or pneumonia with cyanosis, grunting, severe chest retraction, lethargy, somnolence, seizures.
It is important to note that CT chest is not indicated in the diagnosis or management of COVID-19 in children and is only considered when there is no improvement in the respiratory status.



Regarding the management of severe COVID-19 infection, the Ministry of Health and Family
welfare (MoHFw) guidelines mention that, in mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection, steroids are avoided and are found to be harmful. However, in rapidly progressive moderate or severe
cases, corticosteroids are used in the treatment.
This can be administered in two ways: Dexamethasone at a dose of o.15 mg/kg, with a maximum    dose of 6 mg, once a day, or Methylprednisolone at a dose of o.75 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 3o mg, once a day.
steroids should be given for 5-7 days, with a gradual tapering off over 1o-14 days, and are avoided within the first 3-5 days of symptom onset, as they prolong viral shedding.
The use of antivirals (option C) or monoclonal antibodies is not recommended for children less than 18 years of age, irrespective of the severity of the infection.
Antimicrobials should not be prescribed unless there is clinical suspicion of a superadded infection or the patient is in septic shock.
Anticoagulants are not indicated routinely, except in patients having a strong personal or family history of thromboembolism or more than four high-risk factors for developing thrombosis.",,A,
Q4,which of the following is seen in physiological jaundice?,"a)Increased indirect bilirubin, increased urobilinogen, absent bilirubin in urine
b)Increased indirect bilirubin, absent urobilinogen, absent bilirubin in urine
c)Increased direct bilirubin, increased urobilinogen, absent bilirubin in urine
d)Increased direct bilirubin, absent urobilinogen, absent bilirubin in urine","In physiological jaundice, there is increased indirect bilirubin, increased urobilinogen, and absent bilirubin in urine.
physiological jaundice (icterus neonatorum) is due to increased bilirubin production from
the breakdown of fetal red blood cells combined with transient limitation in the conjugation of     bilirubin by the immature neonatal liver. It first appears on the 2nd or 3rd days usually peaks on the 4th day at 5-6 mg/dL and decreases to &lt;2 mg/dL between the 5th and 7th days after birth.   physiological jaundice would lead to an increase in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin. Increased    levels of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood lead to increased production of urobilinogen which   would be present in the urine. urine bilirubin is not usually found in this condition.
Risk factors for physiological jaundice include maternal age, maternal diabetes, prematurity,    drugs (vitamin K3, novobiocin), polycythemia, male sex, trisomy 21, cutaneous bruising, blood extravasation as in cephalhematoma, breastfeeding, weight loss, and a family history of
physiological jaundice.
On the other hand, in pathological jaundice, the appearance of jaundice is within the first 24
hours after birth and may be present at or beyond the age of 2 weeks in term babies and 3
weeks in preterms babies. Other signs of pathological jaundice include an increase in serum
bilirubin exceeding 5mg/dL within a 24-hour period, a serum bilirubin level greater than 12mg/dL in a full-term infant or between 1o-14mg/dL in a preterm infant, and a direct bilirubin level more  than 2mg/dL at any given time. Jaundice visible on the palms and soles, unresponsiveness to
phototherapy, and a rapid rise in bilirubin levels during phototherapy indicate pathological jaundice.
when the concentration of unconjugated bilirubin exceeds 2o-25mg/dL, bilirubin would penetrate the blood-brain barrier and lead to kernicterus.



Phototherapy is initiated in babies with pathological jaundice when
the bilirubin levels exceed the 95th percentile on the total serum bilirubin (TSB) normogram.
Babies are kept at a distance of 3o-45 cm from the uV lamp (46o-49o nm) with eyes and gonads    covered. It is avoided in babies with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to the risk of bronze-baby syndrome. Dehydration and hypocalcemia are potential complications and breastfeeding is
encouraged.
Exchange transfusion (ET) is done in cases of bilirubin encephalopathy, Rh incompatibility with significant hemolysis, and bilirubin values exceeding TSB cutoffs for ET.",,A,
Q5,"A child presents with fever and vesicular lesions on the upper limb and the lower limb. Neck stiffness was present. Similar lesions were present on the palms, soles, and oral cavity. CSF   analysis revealed normal glucose levels and elevated lymphocytes and protein. what is the     most likely diagnosis?","a)Bacterial meningitis with sepsis
b)Coxsackie viral meningitis and Hand Foot Mouth disease
c)Herpes simplex gingivostomatitis and meningoencephalitis
d)Tuberculous meningitis","The presence of characteristic vesicular lesions on the palms, soles, and oral cavity is suggestive of Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) caused by the coxsackie virus. The presence of neck
stiffness and CSF showing elevated lymphocytes with normal glucose and elevated protein levels are suggestive of viral meningitis. Coxsackie A viruses can lead to aseptic meningitis.
HFMD is a viral infection commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, which belongs to the subgroup of enteroviruses. In larger outbreaks, other viruses such as enterovirus 71, coxsackie A viruses 5,    6, 7, 9, 1o, and coxsackie B viruses 2 and 5 can also cause the disease.
HFMD typically presents as a mild illness with vesicular lesions on the tongue, posterior pharynx, buccal mucosa, palate, and lips. Lesions may also appear on the hands, fingers, buttocks, and
groin, with a higher prevalence on the hands. These vesicles usually resolve within a week.
Infections with enterovirus 71 can be more severe with neurological and cardiopulmonary
manifestations. Coxsackievirus A16 infections occasionally lead to complications such as
encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, myocarditis, pericarditis, and shock. Coxsackievirus A6 can cause a severe and atypical form of HFMD.
Diagnosing HFMD typically relies on clinical examination of the characteristic lesions.
Confirmatory testing can involve viral culture using samples such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), urine, and mucosal swabs. However, RT-PCR testing is more sensitive and specific for    detecting the viral genome even when cultures are negative.
Treating HFMD involves mainly supportive care as there is no specific proven antiviral agent for  enteroviruses. In cases of enterovirus 71-related cardiopulmonary disease, milrinone is suggested as an effective treatment. Immunoglobulins have been utilized to manage severe cases, although  outcomes vary.
Apart from HFMD, coxsackie A viruses can cause herpangina characterized by febrile vesicular pharyngitis with ulcerating small vesicles on the oral fauces, palate, uvula, and posterior
pharyngeal wall.
on the other hand, coxsackie B viruses can cause pleurodynia or Bornholm disease, myocarditis, and pericarditis in newborns, as well as orchitis and juvenile diabetes.
other options:
option C: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) presents similarly with vesicular lesions but lacks typical   herpetic signs. The absence of atypical symptoms like mouth pain, drooling, and characteristic     herpetic lesions rule out HSV gingivostomatitis. HSV-induced encephalitis causes anosmia, focal



seizures and behavioural changes due to cortex or limbic system damage. The image shows a typical HSV vesicular lesion below:


option A: Bacterial meningitis with sepsis is unlikely given the vesicular lesions' distribution
pattern (bacteria are less likely to cause vesicles in the oral cavity). Moreover, CSF findings in    bacterial meningitis usually show decreased glucose, elevated neutrophils, and elevated protein levels.
option D: Tuberculous meningitis is less likely as there is no history of TB exposure provided. In   most cases, CSF findings in tuberculous meningitis demonstrate elevated lymphocytes and protein levels, along with decreased glucose.",5614-3574.PNG,B,5621-3577.PNG

Q7,which of the following congenital heart disease has equal saturation in all the chambers of the heart?,"a)Tetralogy of Fallot
b)Total anomalous pulmonary venous circulation
c)Tricuspid atresia
d)Transposition of great arteries","In total anomalous pulmonary venous circulation (TAPVC), there is equal saturation in all chambers of the heart.



In TAPVC, the oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins reaches the right atrium (having
deoxygenated blood) instead of the left atrium. It occurs due to the draining of the pulmonary
veins to the superior vena cava or to the inferior vena cava or to both. This is a total mixing
lesion. The blood from this right atrium (RA) passes to the right ventricle and pulmonary artery. This blood also reaches the left atrium through the atrial septal defect or the patent foramen
ovale, and subsequently, to the left ventricle The left atrium is not receiving any blood because all of the pulmonary veins are draining to the right atrium. Therefore, this shunt will be the only
source of blood to it. Since blood from right atrium reaches all the other chambers, the oxygen saturation of the blood in all four chambers is the same.


In (TAPVC), there are three main types: supra-cardiac, cardiac, and infra-cardiac. In supra-cardiac TAPVC, the pulmonary veins merge to form a single vein that drains into either the superior vena
cava or the left innominate vein. In cardiac TAPVC, the pulmonary veins directly drain into the
right atrium or coronary sinus. The most dangerous type is infra-cardiac TAPVC, which is always  obstructive. In this type, the pulmonary veins drain into either the portal vein or the inferior vena cava.
Diagnosis of TAPVC is the demonstration of any vein with doppler flow away from the heart because the normal venous flow is usually toward the heart.
Surgical correction of TAPVR is done in infancy. Pulmonary venous confluence is anastomosed     directly to the left atrium, the ASD is closed, and any connection to the systemic venous circuit is interrupted.
other options
option A - Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) comprises right ventricular outflow tract obstruction,
ventricular septal defect (VSD), overriding of the aorta over the ventricular septum, and right
ventricular hypertrophy. Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction increases the pressure in the right ventricle. This causes right to left shunt through the ventricular septal defect. The
deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle mixes with the oxygenated blood in the left ventricle. Therefore, in this condition, the left atrium has a higher oxygen saturation compared to the left     ventricle due to mixing. The right atria and ventricles have the least oxygen saturation.





option C - Tricuspid atresia is the congenital absence of the tricuspid valve. Therefore, the blood in the right atrium is shunted to the left atrium through the patent foramen ovale or the atrial
septal defect. In the left atrium, the blood from the right atrium mixes with the oxygenated blood and the oxygen saturation decreases. However, the oxygen saturation in the left atrium and left     ventricle is still greater compared to that of the hypoplastic right ventricle.


option D -  Transposition of great arteries (TGA) is characterized by the aorta arising from the
right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle. Because of this, the pulmonary
and systemic circulations remain separate. The right side of the heart has deoxygenated blood and the left side of the heart has oxygenated blood. The pulmonary artery saturation is always higher    than the aortic saturation.",,B,5622-3578.PNG;5623-3580.PNG;5623-3579.PNG;5624-3581.PNG
Q8,which of the following marked structure is damaged in respiratory distress syndrome?,"a)1
b)2
c)3
d)4","Type II pneumocytes, which are marked as 2 in the above image, are damaged in respiratory distress syndrome.
The cells forming the lining epithelium of alveoli (also called pneumocytes) are mainly of the following types:
• Type I pneumocytes - large flattened cells which present a very thin diffusion barrier for gases.    These cells have large cytoplasmic extensions and form the primary lining cells of the alveoli. They are connected to each other by tight junctions.
• Type II pneumocytes (granular pneumocytes) - These are rounded secretory cells bearing
microvilli on their free surfaces. These cells secrete the surfactant which decreases the surface tension between the thin alveolar walls and thus prevents alveoli from collapsing during
respiration. Type II cells are important in alveolar repair as well.
The below image shows the pneumocytes lining the alveoli:





The alveoli are surrounded by pulmonary capillaries. The alveoli also contain other specialized cells, including pulmonary alveolar macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells, neuroendocrine   cells, and mast cells.
Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is seen in premature infants, due to the decreased
production and secretion of the lung surfactant. The surfactant reduces the alveolar surface tension. This phospholipid is synthesized in type II pneumocytes (also called granular
pneumocytes) in the endoplasmic reticulum.
The surfactant appears in the amniotic fluid between 28 and 32 weeks of gestation. Mature levels  of the pulmonary surfactant are present usually after 35 weeks of gestation. In a premature infant, there is a decrease in both the quantity and quality of surfactant resulting in respiratory distress     syndrome.
Administration of antenatal glucocorticoids to mothers who deliver at 24 to 34 weeks can increase surfactant production and reduce the risk of RDS. It includes either giving 2 doses of
betamethasone 12mg/dose with 24 hours between each dose, or 4 doses of dexamethasone 6mg/dose, with 12 hours between each dose.
Mild to moderate RDS can be managed with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP is a noninvasive modality of support where a continuous distending pressure (5-7 cm H2o) is
applied at the nostril level to keep the alveoli open in a spontaneously breathing baby. Severe cases will require mechanical ventilation.
Surfactant administration is reserved for severe cases and moderate cases not improving even with fio2&gt; 4o% in CPAP.
with treatment, it rarely leads to respiratory failure and has a good prognosis.",5615-3575.PNG,B,5625-3582.PNG
Q9,which of the following are causes of neonatal seizures ?,"a)1, 2, 3 only
b)1, 2, 3, and 4
c)1, 3, 4 only
d)2, 4 only","All of the above-given options, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and
hypernatremia are causes of neonatal seizures.



The causes of neonatal seizure according to the age of presentation are summarised in the table below:
Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is the most common cause. Metabolic disorders cause neonatal seizures commonly. Hypoglycemia is the most common metabolic cause of neonatal seizures.
Neonatal seizures may be of different types - subtle, tonic, clonic, spasms, and myoclonic.
subtle seizures are the most common type of neonatal seizures. They involve movements like transient eye deviations, nystagmus, blinking, mouthing, cycling, and apnea, and are more
common in premature infants.
Tonic seizures are characterized by increased muscle tension, either focal (sustained posturing of a single limb) or generalized (bilateral tonic limb extensions or flexions of the upper limbs with    tonic extension of the lower limbs and trunk). They can not be provoked by stimulation or
suppressed by restraint.
clonic seizures involve repetitive contractions of muscle groups. spasms are sudden generalized jerks associated with brief discharges.
Myoclonic seizures are the least common type of neonatal seizures and are rapid jerks (&lt;5o msec) without rhythmicity.
Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the preferred diagnostic investigation for seizures, while MRI is   the recommended neuroimaging modality for etiological evaluation. phenobarbital is the drug of choice for treatment. In term neonates, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is the most
common cause of seizures, while intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is more prevalent in preterm neonates.

Q10,"A neonate is found to have increased irritability, poor feeding, and 2 episodes of seizures.
Lumbar puncture was done and the findings were suggestive of meningitis. what is the most likely causative organism?","a)Escherichia coli
b)streptococcus agalactiae
c)Neisseria meningitidis
d)Listeria monocytogenes","The given clinical scenario describes neonatal meningitis. E. coli &gt; streptococcus agalactiae, part of group B streptococci, are the most likely causative organism of neonatal meningitis.



Early features of meningitis include temperature instability (hypo or hyperthermia), lethargy,
bradycardia, and feed intolerance. Late features include seizures, bulging fontanelle, and nuchal rigidity.
The most common cause of bacterial meningitis in a o to 2-month baby is group B streptococci
(option B) worldwide and gram-ve bacteria like E.coli and klebsiella (option A) in India. In babies aged 2 to 24 months, pneumococci are the primary causative pathogens, followed by H.
influenzae. For children older than 2 years, pneumococci remain a prominent cause of meningitis, with Neisseria meningitidis being the second most common pathogen.
The most common etiological agents of neonatal meningitis and sepsis are listed in the table below:
Neonates have immature cellular and humoral immunity. This makes them prone to meningitis
and sepsis. Thus, an infant with a fever who is 28 days or younger, should be evaluated for sepsis.
option C: Meningococcal infections are usually asymptomatic. If invasive disease occurs, then the clinical spectrum varies widely from meningococcal meningitis (highest proportion) to bacteremia without sepsis, meningococcal septicemia with or without meningitis, pneumonia, chronic
meningococcemia, and occult bacteremia.
option D: Meningitis caused by Listeria monocytogenes is rare but clinically significant. Infants can acquire the infection in utero or through an infected birth canal. Neonatal listeriosis can
manifest as early-onset disease, typically within 1-2 days of birth, primarily as a septicemic form.  Alternatively, it can present as a late-onset disease in infants older than 5 days, predominantly as a meningitic form.

Q11,At what age does a child attain half-height of the adult height?,"a)12 - 18 months
b)2o - 24 months
c)32 - 36 months
d)4o - 48 months","A child attains half of the adult height by 2o -24 months.
The normal length at birth is 5o cm, increasing to around 75 cm at 1 year of age. By the end of the second year, the length ranges from 85 to 9o cm.
From age 2 to around 12 years, there is a steady growth of about 6 cm per year. During pubertal     growth spurts after age 12, females grow an average of 8 cm per year, while males grow around 1o cm per year.
By around 2 years of age, a normal child reaches half of their adult height (around 8o-85 cm).
Height doubles by age 4 and triples by age 12 compared to the birth length.
Between 18-24 months, a child experiences significant growth and development.
physically, they improve their balance, learn to run and climb stairs, and reach about half of their adult height. Head growth slows slightly, with 85% of adult head circumference achieved by the



age of 2 years.
cognitive development includes the establishment of object permanence and problem-solving skills (e.g., using a stick to obtain a toy that is out of reach).
Emotionally, they display self-recognition and recognize when toys are broken. when toddlers see anything abnormal in their noses while gazing into a mirror for the first time, they tend to touch    their own faces rather than reaching out toward the reflected image.
Linguistically, their vocabulary expands from 1o-15 words to 5o-1oo words, and they start
combining words to form simple sentences while understanding two-step commands (eg., give me the ball and then get your shoes).",,B,
