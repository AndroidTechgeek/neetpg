Q1,Identify the maneuver being performed in the given image.,"a)Head tilt, chin lift
b)Jaw thrust
c)Head extension
d)In line manual stabilization","The maneuver performed in the given image is that of a head-tilt chin-lift. It is an important technique in emergency airway management to open up the airway.
Basic life support (BLS) involves early recognition and management of emergencies such as heart attack, stroke, and foreign body airway obstruction. The sequence of BLS is circulation (chest
compression), airway, and breathing.



The airway is usually obstructed by posterior displacement of the tongue or epiglottis. one hand    (palm) is placed on the patient’s forehead, applying pressure to tilt the head back. simultaneously, the chin is lifted with the forefinger and index finger of the opposite hand. This causes cervical
flexion with an atlantooccipital extension (sniffing position). This lifts the tongue from the back of the throat.
Head-tilt chin-lift should not be performed in a patient with suspected cervical injury.


other options:
option B: Jaw thrust - Both hands of the clinician are placed on either side of the patient’s head, and the angles of the jaw are grasped and lifted. It can be performed in a patient with cervical
injury, but caution must be exercised to not hyperextend the neck.


option D: Manual inline stabilization is a maneuver that limits external head and neck movement in patients with cervical spine injuries. Fingers and palms of both hands are used to stabilize the   patient's occiput and mastoid processes to ensure successful airway intervention.",3482-2174.PNG,A,3465-2164.PNG;3469-2166.PNG;3469-2165.PNG
Q2,which of the following is the drug of choice for preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in a patient undergoing cardiac surgery?,"a)penicillin G
b)Erythromycin
c)Azithromycin
d)cefazolin","First- and second-generation cephalosporins (cefazolin) are the drugs of choice for preoperative prophylaxis for cardiac surgery. Clindamycin is reserved for cases of allergy to beta-lactams and vancomycin is recommended for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRsA).
preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis is essential in reducing the risk of surgical site infections,
particularly in cardiac surgery, where the consequences of infection can be severe. The choice of antibiotic depends on the patient's medical history, allergies, and the most common pathogens
involved in surgical site infections for the specific surgery. In addition to cefazolin, other
cephalosporins, such as cefuroxime, can also be used for prophylaxis in cardiac surgery. The
timing of antibiotic administration is crucial, with the first dose typically given within 6o minutes before the incision.
other options:
option A: penicillin G is not the drug of choice for preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in cardiac   surgery. It is mainly used to treat infections caused by susceptible gram-positive bacteria, such as streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and some strains of staphylococcus aureus.
option B: Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic and is not the drug of choice for preoperative prophylaxis in cardiac surgery. It is typically used to treat respiratory tract infections, skin
infections, and other infections caused by susceptible gram-positive bacteria.
option C: Azithromycin, another macrolide antibiotic, is also not the drug of choice for
preoperative prophylaxis in cardiac surgery. It is commonly used to treat respiratory tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, and other infections caused by susceptible
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.",,D,
Q3,"During resuscitation, when is the given position indicated?","a)unconsciousness with pulse and breathing absent
b)unconsciousness with pulse present and breathing absent
c)unconsciousness with pulse and breathing present
d)unconsciousness with pulse absent and breathing present","The position illustrated in the picture is known as the recovery position, and it is used in the management of patients who are unconscious but with pulse present and breathing present.
The recovery position can help prevent complications such as aspiration and airway obstruction in unconscious individuals. Additionally, it is crucial to monitor the patient's airway, breathing, and   circulation continuously while they are in the recovery position and seek immediate medical
assistance. An unresponsive patient who is breathing spontaneously in the supine position is at
risk of airway obstruction from their tongue, mucus, vomit, etc. A modified lateral position is used and the following 6 principles are considered while choosing which variation of recovery position   to use,
•
The victim should be in as near a true lateral position as possible, with the head dependent to allow free drainage of fluid.
•
The position should be stable.
•
Avoid any pressure on the chest that impairs breathing.
•
It should be possible to turn the victim on his or her side and to return to the back easily and safely, with concern for a possible cervical spine injury.
•
Good observation of and access to the airway should be possible.
•
The position itself should not cause injury to the victim.
other options
option A: unconsciousness with pulse and breathing absent - In this situation, the patient is in cardiac arrest and requires immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), not the recovery    position. CPR involves chest compressions and rescue breaths to support circulation and
respiration.
option B: unconsciousness with pulse present and breathing absent - In this case, the patient is experiencing respiratory arrest. Rescue breathing or bag-valve-mask ventilation should be
initiated to support the patient's breathing. The recovery position is not indicated in this scenario.
option D: unconsciousness with pulse absent and breathing present - This option is not
physiologically plausible, as the absence of a pulse implies a lack of circulation, and breathing cannot be present without circulation.",3483-2175.PNG,C,
