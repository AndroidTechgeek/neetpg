"Q1","which of the following is not a priority condition under the wHo Mental health gap action plan?","a)schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
b)obsessive compulsive disorder
c)Depression
d)Mental health disorders in children","Obseesive compulsive disorder is not a priority condition under WHO Mental health gap action plan.
WHO aims to offer health planners, policymakers, and donors a comprehensive and cohesive set    of initiatives and projects to enhance the provision of care for mental, neurological, and substance use disorders through the Mental Health Gap Action programme (mhGAp).
The priority conditions identified by the above criteria for mhGAp are depression, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, suicide, epilepsy, dementia, disorders due to use of alcohol,
disorders due to use of illicit drugs, and mental disorders in children.
The intervention package includes evidence-based strategies for prevention and management, considering cost-effectiveness, severity of disorders, poverty reduction, and human rights
protection.","","B",""
"Q2","which of the following is not true about 'rapid cyclers'?","a)occurs commonly in men
b)commonly seen with concomitant hypothyroidism
c)At least 4 distinct episodes per year
d)can be triggered by antidepressants","option A is the false statement. Rapid cycling disorder is more common in females.
Rapid cycling disorder is diagnosed when the patient has a combination of 4 or more bipolar
episodes within the last 12 months. Two separate episodes can be demarcated from one another   by either switch in polarity or full/partial remission for at least 2 months. Manic and hypomanic  episodes are considered to be on the same pole, hence a switch in polarity includes an episode of mania/hypomania with an episode of depression.
possible risk factors for rapid cycling disorder include female patients, diabetes, childhood abuse or family trauma, and alcoholism or substance abuse. Rapid-cycling bipolar patients are
significantly more likely than non-rapid-cycling patients to have a lifetime history of comorbidities like anxiety disorders, ADHD, ocD, bulimia nervosa, and substance use disorders.
The drug of choice for prophylaxis of rapid cycling disorder is valproate
other options
option B: conditions like hypothyroidism and diabetes are possibly involved in some cases of rapid cycling .
option D: usage of antidepressants could worsen rapid cycling in bipolar depression.","","A",""
"Q3","which among the following is not part of the Beck's cognitive theory on depression?","a)cognitive decline
b)Automatic thoughts
c)Dysfunctional beliefs
d)Introjection","Introjection is not a part of the Beck's cognitive theory of depression.
Aaron Beck's cognitive triad consists of:
• Beliefs about oneself - a pessimistic self-image
• perceptions of the surroundings - a tendency to see the world as unfriendly and challenging, • Thoughts about the future - anticipating pain and defeat.
The psychodynamic understanding of depression, initially defined by Sigmund Freud and later
expanded by karl Abraham, is considered the classic view of depression. This theory includes four main points: (1) disturbances in the infant-mother relationship during the oral phase (the first 1o   to 18 months of life) create a predisposition to depression later in life; (2) depression can arise
from the real or imagined loss of an important object; (3) introjection of the lost object serves as a defense mechanism to cope with the distress of the loss; and (4) because the lost object is
associated with both love and hate, feelings of anger are turned inward toward the self.","","D",""
"Q4","which of these is not an essential feature for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder?","a)persistent deficits in social communication
b)Abnormalities in socializing
c)Restrictive patterns of behaviour and interests
d)cognitive impairment","cognitive impairment does not form part of the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder are as follows:



• persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, currently or by history
• Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, currently or by history
• symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not become fully
manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be masked by learned strategies in later life).
• symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning.
• These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability or global developmental
delay. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently co-occur; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for the general developmental level.","","D",""
"Q5","All the following can be treated with supportive psychotherapy except","a)person with cognitive decline and physical symptoms
b)person who has good motivation and control over frustration
c)patient with acute psychiatric illness along with crisis
d)patient with severe chronic disease and ego dysfunctioning","supportive psychotherapy is not indicated in a person who has good motivation and control over frustration. such individuals are better treated by expressive psychotherapy.
supportive psychotherapy places major etiological emphasis on external rather than intrapsychic events, particularly on stressful environmental and interpersonal influences on a severely
damaged self. The general aim of supportive treatment is the amelioration or relief of symptoms through behavioral or environmental restructuring within the existing psychic framework. This
often means helping the patient to adapt better to problems and to live more comfortably with his or her psychopathology.
supportive therapy uses several methods, either singly or in combination, including warm,
friendly, strong leadership; help in developing pleasurable activities (e.g., hobbies); removal of  excessive strain, when possible; medication to alleviate symptoms; and guidance and advice in  dealing with current issues. This therapy uses techniques to help patients feel secure, accepted, encouraged, and not anxious.
supportive psychotherapy is generally indicated for those patients for whom classic
psychoanalysis or insight-oriented psychoanalytic psychotherapy is typically contraindicated- those who have poor ego strength and whose potential for decompensation is high.
Amenable patients fall into the following major areas:
• Individuals in acute crisis or a temporary state of disorganization and inability to cope, whose    intolerable life circumstances have produced extreme anxiety or sudden turmoil (e.g., individuals going through grief reactions, illness, divorce, job loss, or who were victims of crime, abuse,
natural disaster, or accident);
• patients with chronic severe pathology with fragile or deficient ego functioning (e.g., those with latent psychosis, impulse disorder, or severe character disturbance);
• patients whose cognitive deficits and physical symptoms make them particularly vulnerable and, thus, unsuitable for an insight-oriented approach (e.g., certain psychosomatic or medically ill
persons);



• Individuals who are psychologically unmotivated (e.g., patients who come to treatment in
response to family or agency pressure and are interested only in immediate relief or those who    need assistance in very specific problem areas of social adjustment as a possible prelude to more exploratory work).
Because support forms a tacit part of every therapeutic modality, it is rarely contraindicated as    such. The typical attitude regards better-functioning patients as unsuitable not because they will be harmed by a supportive approach, but because they will not be s","","B",""
