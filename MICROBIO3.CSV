Q1,"A farmer from the sub-Himalayan belt had a thorn prick injury a year back and developed a warty, verrucous growth at the site of prick. A skin biopsy sample was taken and sent for
histopathological examination. The characteristic microscopic body as shown in the image was seen. which of the following could be the most likely diagnosis?","a)Blastomycosis
b)pheohyphomycosis
c)chromoblastomycosis
d)sporotrichosis","The history of a slowly spreading warty, verrucous lesion following a thorn prick injury and the histopathological image showing medlar bodies is suggestive of chromoblastomycosis.
chromoblastomycosis (chromomycosis) is a subcutaneous mycotic infection that is usually caused by traumatic inoculation. over months to years, the primary lesion becomes verrucous and
wart-like with extension along the draining lymphatics.
Histologically, the lesions are granulomatous and the dark sclerotic bodies may be seen within leukocytes or giant cells called medlar/copper penny bodies.

Q2,choose the wrong statement about plasmodium species:,"a)Drug resistant falciparum is seen in India
b)presence of duffy blood group antigen is protective against vivax
c)severe malaria with shock is called algid malaria
d)Relapse is seen in p. ovale","The absence, not the presence, of the Duffy blood group antigen, is protective against p. vivax because the Duffy antigen normally serves as the receptor for plasmodium vivax.
Drug Efflux pumps are the primary mode of resistance for chloroquine. It is mediated by an ABc transporter encoded by p. falciparum multidrug resistance gene 1 (pfmdr1). The resistance of p.    falciparum to chloroquine increased over time and is present across all regions of the country.

Algid malaria is a rare complication of severe malaria characterized by hemodynamic collapse manifesting as shock with pronounced metabolic changes and hypothermia.
Relapse is seen in cases of plasmodium vivax and plasmodium ovale.
Malaria relapse :
True relapse is caused due to Hypnozoites.
These are resting forms.
In the case of plasmodium vivax and ovale two kinds of sporozoites are seen, some of which :
• multiply inside hepatic cells to form -  schizonts
• others persist and remain dormant as -  hypnozoites
From time to time some are activated to become schizonts and release merozoites, which go on infecting RBcs producing clinical relapse.
In the case of plasmodium falciparum and plasmodium malariae, the initial tissue phase     disappears completely and no hypnozoites are found, hence technically relapse is not seen.",,KEY NOT FOUND,

b)Methanol, kinyoun’s carbol fuchsin, acid alcohol, methylene blue
c)Methanol, dilute carbol fuchsin, acid alcohol, crystal violet
d)Methylene blue, iodine, acid alcohol, carbol fuchsin","Diarrhea in an HIV patient is suggestive of a coccidian parasitic infestation. The image shows a blue background and red-stained oocysts, suggestive of modified acid-fast stain
positive cryptosporidium parvum.
The modified Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) method is used for staining cryptosporidium and isospora   species. unlike the ZN-stain, the modified ZN stain does not require heating of the reagents.
The reagents used in modified ZN stain include:
• Absolute methanol for fixation
• kinyoun’s carbol fuchsin - primary stain
• Acid alcohol - Decolourising agent
• Methylene blue or Malachite green - counterstain",1386-842.PNG,KEY NOT FOUND,

Q6,which among the following occupation is a risk factor for this presenting illness?,"a)kennel worker
b)Lifeguard in a swimming pool
c)veterenarian
d)Poultry worker","The above image shows cutaneous larva migrans. Being a kennel worker is a risk factor for this job as exposure to animal feces is high.
As Larvae are found on sandy beaches, and under dwellings, swimming in natural water bodies would be a risk and not artificial ones like swimming pools.
CLM is caused by various animal hookworm species (e.g., Ancylostoma brazilienses), and the
parasite is acquired from direct skin contact with soil contaminated by dog or cat feces. The
parasitic infection usually begins with an inflamed papule, often located between the toes, where the hookworm species (e.g., Ancylostoma brazilienses) larvae enter the skin.
Serpentine or linear single-track lines later mark the course of the larvae as they migrate through the epidermis of the trunk and lower extremities.
Ivermectin is the first-line drug for the treatment of cutaneous larva migrans, taken as a single 2oo μg/kg oral dose.",1387-843.PNG,KEY NOT FOUND,
Q7,Transmission assessment survey is carried out for:,"a)P. vivax
b)P. falciparum
c)Filariasis
d)Leishmania","Transmission assessment survey is carried out for filariasis.
Mass Drug Administration is used to reduce infection in the community to levels below a
threshold at which mosquitoes are unable to continue spreading the parasites from person to person and thus new infections are prevented.
The transmission assessment survey (TAS) is used to determine when infections have been
reduced below target thresholds and Mass Drug Administration can stop. once MDA has stopped, TAS is used as a surveillance tool to determine that infection levels are sustained below target
thresholds.",,KEY NOT FOUND,

Q9,"A hospital has reported an outbreak of MRSA infection. on investigation, it was found out that a staff nurse had nasal carriage of MRSA. which of the following drugs helps in the     removal of colonization of bacteria?","a)oral vancomycin
b)Inj cephalosporin
c)Topical mupirocin
d)Inhaled colistin","Topical mupirocin is the preferred agent for the elimination of nasal carriers of MRSA.
As Mupirocin has no structural similarities with existing systemic antibiotics that might lead to
the development of cross-resistance and has minimal toxicity in its topical form, it is approved for the prevention of MRSA outbreaks
Mixed therapy with systemic agents is not preferred as it would cause unnecessary antibiotic exposure potentially paving way for drug resistance.",,KEY NOT FOUND,

Q11,which toxin acts via the mechanism depicted in the image below?,"a)Botulinum
b)Tetanus
c)Diphtheria
d)Pertussis","The image given above depicts the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin.

It causes proteolysis of snare proteins. Snare proteins have three components- synaptobrevin,
SNAP25 and syntaxin. The snare protein is required for the excocytosis of acetylcholine vesicles. Thus it leads to presynaptic inhibition of neuronal transmission.
There are 7 different strains of clostridium botulinum and each strain acts by a different
mechanism. Toxins of C. Botulinum A, C and E cleave SNAP25. Type C also cleaves syntaxin. Type B, D, F and G cleave synaptobrevin.",1389-845.PNG,KEY NOT FOUND,

c)ADP ribosylation of EF2
d)RNA glycosidase","The given image shows gram-positive rods with club-shaped ends, beaded appearance, and a Chinese-letter pattern of arrangement indicative of Corynebacterium diphtheriae.
The toxin produced by the bacteria - diphtheria toxin - inhibits polypeptide chain elongation and protein synthesis by inactivating the elongation factor-2 (EF-2) by ADP ribosylation. It has two
fragments - fragment B helps in binding of the toxin to host cells and fragment A inactivates EF-2.",1389-844.PNG,KEY NOT FOUND,1397-848.PNG
Q13,A 25-year old man presents with a history of urethral discharge for the last three days. A gram stain smear of the discharge is shown below. All of the following are true regarding the likely   etiology except?,"a)catalase and oxidase positive
b)Pili is a virulence factor
c)obligate intracellular organism
d)shows twitching motility","The given slide shows gram-negative diplococci within the polymorphs, characteristic of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. Neisseria is not an obligate intracellular organism, it can also occur
extracellularly i.e, it is a facultative intracellular organism. The other neisseria that are found as normal inhabitants of the human respiratory tract occur extracellularly.
Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative, non-sporulating, non-motile diplococcus that is aerobic but may grow anaerobically also. It is oxidase and catalase-positive.
Although Neisseria are non-motile organisms, they show twitching motility. This is a
flagella-independent form of bacterial translocation over moist surfaces that occurs by the
extension and retraction of polar type IV pili. These pili act as virulence factors by promoting attachment to host cells and inhibiting phagocytosis.

virulence factors for gonococci:
• Outer Membrane proteins (OMps)
• IgA proteases
• pili
• Lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS)
• Transferrin
• Lactoferrin-binding protein",1390-846.PNG,KEY NOT FOUND,
Q14,The cLED medium is preferred over Macconkey agar for the culture of organisms in case of UTI because:,"a)It inhibits proteus swarming
b)It promotes the growth of candida, streptococcus and staphylococcus
c)It differentiates between lactose-fermenting and non-lactose fermenting bacteria
d)It promotes the growth of pseudomonas","cLED (cysteine lactose electrolyte-deficient) medium is preferred over Macconkey agar for the
culture of organisms involved in urinary tract infections because it is less inhibitory and promotes the growth of gram-positive bacteria (except β hemolytic streptococcus) and candida.
A combination of blood agar and Macconkey agar is used for the processing of urine specimens. cLED medium is used as an alternative for this combination. It can also prevent swarming of
proteus, and is thus different from blood agar. Like Macconkey agar, it differentiates between
lactose fermenters and non-fermenters. Lactose fermenters change the colour of the medium from green to yellow. However, these two facts are not the reason it is better than Macconkey agar for   evaluation of UTI.",,KEY NOT FOUND,1398-849.PNG
Q15,which of the following organisms cause multiple alveolar-like lesions in the liver?,"a)Echinococcus multilocularis
b)Echinococcus granulosus
c)Entamoeba histolytica
d)cysticercus cellulosae","Echinococcus multilocularis causes multiple alveolar-like lesions in the liver.
E. multilocularis leads to the formation of a multilocular hydatid cyst, most commonly affecting the liver. It presents as multiple small cysts in the liver.

Echinococcus granulosus causes a hollow fluid-filled unilocular cyst in the liver. The CT below shows water lily sign, which is seen in the hydatid disease of the lung. It is caused
by Echinococcus granulosus. (option B)


The water-lily sign occurs due to the detachment of the endocyst membrane from the cyst wall,
giving the appearance of floating membranes within the pericyst. This mimics the appearance of a water lily. It is classically visualised on plain radiographs (mainly chest X-ray) when the collapsed  membranes are calcified but may be seen on ultrasound, CT, or MRI.",,KEY NOT FOUND,1399-850.PNG
Q16,All of the following can be seen intracellularly in hepatocytes except:,"a)Toxoplasma
b)plasmodium
c)Babesia
d)Leishmania","Babesia is an intracellular parasite of RBCs, not of the hepatocytes.
Its trophozoites invade the RBCs.
The liver is usually not affected as babesia lack an exoerythrocytic phase.",,KEY NOT FOUND,
Q17,A Giemsa stain of a thin peripheral smear is prepared. which of the following cannot be diagnosed?,"a)coxiella burnetii
b)Toxoplasma gondii
c)Bartonella henselae
d)Ehrlichia chaffeensis","The diagnosis of Coxiella burnetii cannot be done using a Giemsa stain of a thin peripheral smear. It is done mainly by serology, which shows a rise in the titer of specific antibodies to C. burnetii.
Microorganisms such as Histoplasma, Leishmania, Toxoplasma, and pneumocystis can also be detected with Giemsa, and in gastric tissues, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) appear thin and
distinctly blue. Giemsa’s stain is frequently used for diagnostic purposes in haematology to
differentiate the nuclear and cytoplasmic morphology of platelets, RBCs, WBCs, and parasites.",,KEY NOT FOUND,
Q18,which of the following is false about influenza?,"a)virus shedding is present before symptoms begins b) 5-12 years is a high risk group
b)Aquatic birds act as reservoir
c)secondary attack rate is 5-15%","children &lt;5-years, especially those &lt;2-years of age are at the highest risk of serious complications related to influenza infection.
other high-risk groups for influenza include adults ≥6o years of age, persons with chronic diseases, persons who are immunocompromised.
option A: The virus is shed in respiratory secretions a day before the onset of illness and for 3-4 days thereafter.
option c: Birds, especially aquatic birds act as reservoirs of influenza viruses.
option D: secondary attack rate is 5- 15%.",,KEY NOT FOUND,
Q19,β 1-3 glucan assay is used to diagnose all except?,"a)candidiasis
b)Aspergillosis
c)pneumocystis pneumonia
d)Mucormycosis","The β-1-3 glucan assay cannot be used to diagnose mucormycosis. This condition is usually diagnosed based on clinical features and culture.
The β-1-3 glucan assay detects the presence of (1-3)-β-d-glucan (BDG), an abundant cell wall
polysaccharide found in most fungi. It is a chromogenic, quantitative enzyme immunoassay (EIA) designed to detect beta-D-glucan by using purified, lysed horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus)    amebocytes. 1,3 Beta D Glucan level of ≥8o pg/mL is considered a positive result.
Fungi that do not contain BDG in their cell walls include cryptococcus neoformans, zygomycetes   like rhizopus and mucor and Blastomyces dermatitidis. Mucormycosis is an opportunistic mycosis caused by zygomycetes, which do not contain (1-3)-β-d-glucan, and hence, the β 1-3 glucan assay    cannot be used for its diagnosis.",,KEY NOT FOUND,
Q20,which of the following is a xenodiagnostic method?,"a)Rabbit ileal loop assay for ETEc
b)Injecting Aedes thorax with blood of a patient with suspected dengue
c)Injecting a hamster with splenic biopsy for diagnosis of leishmaniasis
d)Intradermal test on guinea pigs for toxigenicity of corynebacterium diphtheria","Injecting Aedes thorax with blood of a patient with suspected dengue is the xenodiagnostic method among the given options.
xenodiagnosis (xenos- foreign) is an indirect method of identifying the infectious disease agents     (i.e. the pathogen). In xenodiagnosis, the vector of a pathogenic agent is infected and the pathogen is allowed to multiply in the vector. The vector acts as the “foreign” host. Later, the vector is
examined for the presence of the pathogen.
This method was first used by Brumpt for the diagnosis of chagas disease. Laboratory bred
Reduviid bugs (vector/ foreign host) are allowed to feed on the suspected patients (original host). After 4-5 weeks, the feces of the bugs are microscopically examined for amastigote forms of
Trypanosoma cruzi (pathogen).
Another method of xenodiagnosis is the intrathoracic inoculation of the mosquitoes (vector) with viruses (pathogen). The virus multiplies in different organs of the mosquito and can be easily
demonstrated. Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Toxorhynchites mosquitoes are used for the identification of the dengue virus.
In Trichinella spiralis infection, muscle biopsy bits from suspected patients are fed to laboratory rats (vector for T. spiralis). The larvae of T. spiralis can be demonstrated in the muscles of the

infected lab rats.
Advantage of xenodiagnosis: It is useful in cases where a direct microscopic diagnosis is difficult due to the low count of pathogens in the blood of the host/patient.
other options:
option A: Rabbit ileal loop assay for ETEC is a method of detection of toxigenicity/ virulence testing.
option C: Injecting a hamster with splenic biopsy for diagnosis of leishmaniasis is a method of animal inoculation.
option D: Intradermal test on guinea pigs for toxigenicity of Corynebacterium diphtheria is a method of virulence testing.",,KEY NOT FOUND,
