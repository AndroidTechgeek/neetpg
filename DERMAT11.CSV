Q1,"A patient presents to you with multiple anogenital warts. The biopsy of these lesions showed squamous atypia. which of the following human papillomavirus types are considered
high-risk?","a)HPV 2
b)HPV 18
c)HPV 6
d)HPV 11","Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 are considered high-risk types that are commonly  implicated in cervical, vaginal and vulval cancer. other high-risk types include HPV types 31, 33,



and 35.
The E6 protein of high-risk types binds to the p53 gene while the E7 protein inactivates the pRb     gene. p53 and pRb are tumor suppressor genes that when inactivated results in uncontrolled cell    proliferation. The most common type of cancer seen is squamous cell carcinoma. The image below depicts vulval carcinoma which is also associated with HPV infection.
The image given above shows anogenital warts pointing to condyloma acuminata (venereal warts). It is commonly caused by HPV types 6 and 11. However, rarely HPV 16 and 18 can cause it too. It   is sexually transmitted. Patients are advised not to involve in intercourse when active genital
warts are present. It can appear discrete or may coalesce to resemble cauliflower-like growths. 2o% of cases may develop into cervical, vaginal, or vulval cancers. Risk factors include oral
contraceptives and pregnancy. The condition is diagnosed by colposcopy.
The presence ofkoilocytes on histopathological examination is pathognomonic of the virus. These are cells with irregular and hyperchromatic nuclei, perinuclear halo, and peripheral cytoplasmic    condensation. These cells disappear when there are dysplastic changes.
The image below depicts koilocytes.


other options:
option A - HPV type 2 is responsible for common warts in non-genital regions.
options C and D - HPV types 6 and 11 are responsible for anogenital warts and laryngeal papillomatosis.",3678-2352.PNG,B,3683-2358.PNG
Q2,"A farmer presents to you with a swelling on the foot and multiple discharging sinuses in the lower limb. Granules from the discharge were examined under the microscope, which is
shown below. which of the following is true regarding this condition?","a)Both bacteria and fungi can be causative
b)undergoes lymphatic spread
c)There is lymphocyte accumulation
d)Involves only superficial tissues","The clinical vignette along with the image showing sulfur granules is consistent with the diagnosis of mycetoma. Both bacteria and fungi can be causative agents of the disease.
Mycetoma is a chronic, slow-progressing subcutaneous infection that commonly affects the foot. other sites which can be affected include the hands, upper back, and posterior part of the neck.



The mode of infection is usually traumatic. Agricultural workers are more prone to infection.


There are three types - eumycetoma, actinomycetoma, and botryomycosis. Eumycetoma is caused  by fungal species such as Madurella mycetomatis and Madurella grisea. Adjacent fascia and bones may be involved as the disease progresses.
Actinomyces israelii and Nocardia asteroides result in the bacterial form - actinomycetoma. It is generally more invasive and can spread via the fascial planes to the underlying muscle or bone.  Dissemination is rare but can occur in lesions of the head and neck.
staphylococcus aureus and other pyogenic bacteria can cause botryomycosis.
Initially, it starts off as a small subcutaneous swelling of the foot, which then enlarges to form multiple discharging sinuses. The discharge contains granules which are microcolonies of the  causative organism. Different causative organisms produce granules that are characteristic in  color, consistency, and size, which helps in delineating the agent in each case.
The granules in eumycetoma are generally hard, while that in actinomycetoma is soft in
consistency.
Medical management of eumycetoma includes ketoconazole and miconazole, while that of
actinomycetoma includes dapsone or rifampicin. It should be continued for 18-24 months even after symptomatic recovery or the absence of laboratory evidence for infection.",3679-2353.PNG,A,3684-2359.PNG
Q3,"A farmer presents to you with a cauliflower-shaped mass on the foot, which developed after a minor injury. Microscopy shows copper penny bodies. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)chromoblastomycosis
b)Blastomycosis
c)sporotrichosis
d)phaeohyphomycosis","The most likely diagnosis based on the clinical vignette is chromoblastomycosis.
chromomycosis is a term used to describe various conditions caused by pigmented
(dematiaceous) fungi. chromoblastomycosis, the most common chromomycosis, is more commonly seen in tropical areas among agricultural workers and woodcutters who walk  barefoot. Traumatic implantation is the mode of infection.



patients present with warty cauliflower-like cutaneous nodules on the feet and lower legs. species of the fungal genus Fonsecaea are implicated as the causative agents. Diagnosis is made by the
demonstration of sclerotic bodies (copper-penny bodies) in tissue sections. sclerotic bodies appear as round or irregular, dark brown bodies with septae.



It can be managed with itraconazole (1oo–2oo mg daily) or terbinafine (25o mg daily). For small lesions, surgical excision is the therapy of choice.
other options:
option B - Blastomycosis is an infection caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis. It causes a chronic infection with granulomatous and suppurative lesions, which starts in the lungs but may
disseminate to other organs. symptoms of an acute lower respiratory tract infection with
pulmonary infiltrates are the most common clinical presentations. Microscopic examination of stained specimens shows broad-based budding yeast cells.





option C - sporotrichosis caused by the dimorphic fungus sporothrix schenckii, is commonly seen in gardeners followed by minor trauma. patients present with skin nodules or lymph node
ulceration. Microscopy shows asteroid bodies. It can be seen as an oval, basophilic structure with eosinophilic radiation.






option D - phaeohyphomycosis caused by dematiaceous fungi is frequently encountered in
immunodeficient individuals. clinical manifestations include brain abscesses, intramuscular
abscesses, and cysts. on microscopy, the fungi appear as distorted hyphal strands. In contrast to chromoblastomycosis, sclerotic bodies are not found.",,A,3686-2360.PNG
Q4,A patient presents with an anesthetic patch in the areas on the face as shown in the image below. which of the following nerves is the most commonly involved in this condition?,"a)Abducens nuclei
b)Facial nerve
c)optic nerve
d)Trigeminal nerve","The clinical scenario points to a case of leprosy and the most commonly involved cranial nerve is the facial nerve.
Leprosy is a chronic granulomatous condition caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It affects the skin, cutaneous and peripheral nerves, and mucous membranes. The most commonly affected
peripheral nerves are the posterior tibial nerve followed by ulnar, median, and lateral popliteal nerves. The most commonly involved cranial nerve is the facial nerve.
Leprosy has a long incubation period, usually ranging from 2 to 12 years. It commonly presents as an area of numbness on the skin or a visible skin lesion which could be a hypopigmented or
erythematous macule. Lesions usually involve the face, extensor aspect of the limbs, trunks, and buttocks. The lesions have impaired nerve function and poor hair growth. The patients may also present with burns or ulcers of the anesthetic limb.
classification systems of leprosy include:
• Ridley Jopling classification:
• Tuberculoid (TT)
• Borderline tubercular (BT)
• Borderline (BB)
• Borderline lepromatous (BL)
• Lepromatous (LL)
• WHO classification:
• paucibacillary
• Multibacillary
The cardinal signs for the diagnosis of leprosy include:



• characteristic skin lesions- hypopigmented or erythematous lesions with definite impairment of sensation.
• Peripheral nerve involvement- thickening of the nerve with sensory impairment. Nerve tenderness can also be seen.
• Detection of acid-fast bacilli in slit-skin smear, skin biopsy, or positive biopsy PcR.
The presence of two of the three signs can establish the diagnosis of leprosy. other tests done for diagnosis of leprosy include nerve biopsy in pure neural leprosy and PGL-1 antibody in cases in    low bacterial load.",3680-2355.PNG,B,
Q5,A female patient with a body mass index of 3o kg/m2 presents to you with a lesion on the neck as shown below. which of the following condition is she most likely to be suffering    from?,"a)Hypothyroidism
b)Metabolic syndrome
c)Addison's disease
d)Hyperparathyroidism","The patient is most likely to be suffering from metabolic syndrome based on the clinical scenario given and the image depicting acanthosis nigricans.
Metabolic syndrome (syndrome X) is a group of conditions that increases the risk for
cardiovascular disease. These include hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and central obesity. Increasing age, genetics, and sedentary lifestyle are considered risk factors.
Insulin resistance is the most accepted hypothesis used to explain the pathophysiology of the
condition. An elevated level of circulating fatty acids is considered a major factor in the
development of insulin resistance. It is associated with acanthosis nigricans which are velvety
hyperpigmented lesions in skin flexures such as the axilla, groin, and back of the neck. Acanthosis nigricans can also be seen in malignancies, especially those of the gastrointestinal tract,
acromegaly, and cushing's syndrome.
other conditions associated with metabolic syndrome include polycystic ovary syndrome,
obstructive sleep apnea, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The condition is managed by dietary and lifestyle modifications. Individual components of the syndrome also need to be addressed by   the use of statins, antihypertensives, or hypoglycemic agents.
other options:
option A - Hypothyroidism is more common in women and can be either congenital or acquired. Autoimmune and iatrogenic hypothyroidism are the common causes of the latter. symptoms
include dry coarse skin, weight gain, poor appetite, fatigue, and alopecia.





option C - Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency), most commonly caused by
autoimmune adrenalitis presents with hyperpigmentation of the skin, especially in areas exposed to sunlight or prone to friction. This is due to excessive stimulation of melanocytes by the raised  adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This is seen in chronic cases.


option D - Hyperparathyroidism is a disorder that arises due to excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone. solitary adenomas are the most common cause. It primarily affects the renal and
skeletal systems. sestamibi scan is the imaging of choice to delineate parathyroid abnormalities.",3680-2354.PNG,B,3690-2364.PNG;3690-2363.PNG
Q6,Irregular pitting of nails with subungual hyperkeratosis is seen in _______.,"a)Lichen planus
b)psoriasis
c)Atopic dermatitis
d)Alopecia areata","Irregular pitting of nails with subungual hyperkeratosis is seen in psoriasis.



psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the skin with systemic manifestations. plaque
psoriasis is the most common type. The nails are frequently involved, and punctate pitting is the most common finding seen. Nail beds can also be affected, giving rise to the oil-drop sign—a
highly specific sign seen in this condition. other manifestations include subungual hyperkeratosis, splinter hemorrhages, and distal onycholysis.
The skin is involved in the form of red/ salmon pink, scaly, and well-demarcated lesions. A
peripheral clearing (ring of woronoff) may be present. It is usually seen on the scalp, trunk, and     extensor surfaces of the limbs. The lesions are surrounded by silvery-white scales. The appearance of a smooth, glossy red membrane with small bleeding points on the removal of the
supra-papillary epidermis by gentle scraping (Auspitz's sign) is characteristic.
psoriasis is associated with koebner or isomorphic phenomenon. It describes the appearance of new lesions along the site of trauma (linear lesions). It is also observed in lichen planus.
Topical application of steroids, retinoids, vitamin D, and emollients is the mainstay of
management. phototherapy and oral methotrexate, acitretin, and cyclosporine can also be used. Both methotrexate and acitretin are teratogenic drugs. It is recommended that women do not
conceive for three years after cessation of the acitretin.
other options:
option A - Lichen planus is an inflammatory disorder affecting the skin and mucosal membranes. Nail involvement includes exaggeration of the longitudinal lines and linear depression. This is due to nail plate thinning. If the nail bed is involved, it can result in hyperpigmentation, subungual
hyperkeratosis, and onycholysis. In some cases, pterygium unguis can be seen due to adhesion between the dorsal nail fold and the nail bed.
option C - Atopic dermatitis is a relapsing chronic inflammatory skin disease. patients present with itchy erythematous papules/papulo-vesicles in flexural regions. Nail involvement is in the  form of coarse pitting and ridging.
option D - Alopecia areata is a condition that results in non-scarring hair loss. It can cause fine  stippled pitting of the nails, roughening of the nail plate (trachyonychia), or atrophic dystrophy.",3681-2356.PNG,B,
Q7,A 35-year-old woman presents to you with hair loss for the past three months. she tested positive for COVID-19 eight months ago. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Tinea capitis
b)Telogen effluvium
c)Trichotillomania
d)Female-pattern androgenic alopecia","The most likely diagnosis based on the clinical scenario is telogen effluvium.
The hair follicle goes through three phases known as the hair cycle:
• Anagen: phase of active hair growth
• Catagen: Involutionary phase
• Telogen: Time period between catagen and next anagen phase
Telogen effluvium is a type of nonscarring alopecia that is marked by diffuse shedding of normal hair. This occurs due to premature termination of the anagen phase of the hair cycle.  It can be    either acute or chronic.
Acute telogen effluvium occurs 2-3 months after a stressful event such as high fever, surgery,
starvation, and hemorrhage. Hormonal fluctuations during the postpartum period can trigger it
(telogen gravidarum). Telogen effluvium can result in a diffuse reduction in hair density but never



total baldness. It generally resolves spontaneously.
chronic telogen effluvium is used to describe the diffuse shedding of telogen hair for more than 6 months. common causes include thyroid disorders, iron-deficiency anemia, and malnutrition.
other options:
option A - Tinea capitis is used to describe an infection of the scalp by the dermatophyte group of fungi. The most common pathogenic species are Trichophyton tonsurans and Trichophyton
violaceum. The presentation can vary from hair breakage associated with scaling to widespread inflammatory mass on the scalp.
clinical variants of tinea capitis:
• Endothrix - A non-inflammatory type in which multiple black dots are present within the areas of alopecia
• Ectothrix - A mild inflammatory type in which single or multiple scaly patches with hair loss are seen
• Kerion - A severe inflammatory type that presents with an inflammatory mass with thick crusting and matting of hair with pus and sinus formation
• Favus - characterized by the presence of yellowish, cup■shaped crusts known as scutula that develop around hair follicles
observation under KoH mount is used for diagnosis.






option C - Trichotillomania (trichotillosis) is considered an obsessive-compulsive disorder (oCD) spectrum disorder, marked by gratification from pulling one's own hair. It could be associated
with underlying anxieties or depression. The vertex region of the scalp is most commonly
involved. scalp histology will show perifollicular hemorrhages and intrafollicular pigment casts.


option D - Androgenic hair loss is used to describe a progressive decrease in hair fiber
production. Dihydrotestosterone, an androgenic metabolite, is implicated in the etiology. Female-pattern hair loss involves the mid-frontal scalp diffusely. There is no or minimal  involvement of the temporal region.",3682-2357.PNG,B,3692-2365.PNG;3693-2367.PNG;3693-2366.PNG;3694-2368.PNG
