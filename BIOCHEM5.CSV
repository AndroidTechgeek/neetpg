Question 1,which of the following is responsible for the negative charge in fibrinopeptide A?,"a) Glutamate and valine
b) Histidine and Lysine
c) Aspartate and glutamate
d) serine and Threonine","Aspartate and glutamate are responsible for the negative charge in fibrinopeptide A and B of fibrinogen.
The negative charges contribute to the solubility of fibrinogen in plasma and importantly also serve to prevent aggregation by causing electrostatic repulsion between fibrinogen molecules.",,C,
Question 2,serotonin is also known as?,"a) 5 hydroxytryptamine
b) 5 hydroxytryptophan
c) 5 carboxytryptamine
d) 5 carboxytryptophan","serotonin is also known as 5 hydroxy-tryptamine, and it is a monoamine neurotransmitter. serotonin is produced by hydroxylation of tryptophan and subsequent decarboxylation. It is a potent vasoconstrictor and stimulator of smooth muscle contraction.
Clinical correlation:
In carcinoid syndrome, excessive levels of serotonin is produced which causes flushing, diarrhea, wheezing, damage to the tricuspid valve, etc. The levels of 5-oH indole acetic acid (serotonin metabolite) is elevated in the urine.",,A,
Question 3,which of the following is true about DNA polymerase I?,"a) It is involved in the creation of okazaki fragments.
b) It is found in prokaryotes.
c) It synthesises RNA primers.
d) It is the primary enzyme of DNA synthesis.","The true statement is that DNA polymerase I (pol I) is found in prokaryotes.
The prokaryotic polymerases are DNA polymerases I, II, and III. DNA polymerase I recognize a “nick” or break in the phosphate backbone, and then removes each RNA primer and fills the gaps with DNA. It does this through its 5'→3' exonuclease activity. It has DNA repair activity through 3'→5' exonuclease activity. DNA polymerase II carries out DNA proofreading and repair. DNA polymerase III is the primary enzyme for the synthesis of the leading strand of DNA.
option A: DNA polymerase δ (eukaryotic polymerase) synthesizes okazaki fragments which are short, newly synthesized DNA fragments that are formed on the lagging template strand during DNA replication. They are complementary to the lagging template strand.
option C: primase synthesizes RNA primers to start the replication.",,B,nan;764-620.PNG
Question 4,A patient presents with recurrent kidney stones. Microscopic examination finding of the urine specimen is shown below. which of the following is not seen in the urine of this patient?,"a) ornithine
b) Lysine
c) Arginine
d) Histidine","The image shows hexagonal, translucent and white crystals suggestive of cystinuria. Histidine is not seen in the urine of this patient.
cystinuria is an autosomal-recessive disease due to a defect in renal PcT & intestinal amino acid transporter that is essential for reabsorptive transport of cystine and the dibasic amino acids Ornithine, Lysine, and Arginine (cOLA).
Diagnosis of cystinuria is by the cyanide–nitroprusside test. Initial treatment is with adequate hydration, alkalization of the urine with citrate supplementation or acetazolamide, and dietary modification to reduce salt and protein intake. If this fails then patients are usually started on chelation therapy with penicillamine.",759-619.PNG,D,
Question 5,In which condition is excessive urinary excretion of 5- hydroxy indole acetic acid seen?,"a) Alkaptonuria
b) Albinism
c) carcinoid syndrome
d) phenylketonuria","Excessive urinary excretion of 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (5-HIAA) is seen in carcinoid syndrome.
carcinoid syndrome is marked by symptoms of bronchospasm, cutaneous flushing, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. It occurs due to excessive production of serotonin, a specialized product of tryptophan metabolism by tumors commonly in the small intestine, liver and lungs. It is then metabolized and excreted in urine as 5-HIAA.",,C,
Question 6,which of the following should be avoided by a patient of fish odour syndrome?,"a) Biotin
b) choline
c) Niacin
d) pantothenic acid","A fishy odor is seen in trimethylaminuria. consumption of food products with choline should be avoided in fish odor syndrome.
Fish odor syndrome (trimethylaminaminuria) is an autosomal recessive disease where TMA(trimethylamine) is not converted to the non-odorous TMAO (TMA-N-oxide) in the liver. This is due to the deficiency of flavin-containing mono oxygenase 3 (FMO3). TMA then builds up in the body and is released in sweat, urine, and breath, giving off a strong odor of rotting fish from the body.
choline, lecithin, and TMAO are precursors oftrimethylamine which are found in food products. These food products are eggs, liver, peanuts, meat, poultry, fish, dairy foods, pasta, and rice.",,B,
Question 7,which of the following is true regarding an allosteric modifier?,"a) Desaturates the enzyme
b) causes the enzyme to work faster only.
c) Binds to the catalytic site
d) participates in feedback regulation","An allosteric modifier of an enzyme usually participates in feedback regulation.
Allosteric regulations are a natural example of control loops, such as feedback from downstream products or feedforward from upstream substrates. Allosteric regulation is also particularly important in the cell's ability to adjust enzyme activity.
An allosteric modifier or effector binds to the allosteric site to induce a conformational change in the catalytic or active site. Those modifiers or effectors that enhance the protein's activity are referred to as allosteric activators, whereas those that decrease the protein's activity are called allosteric inhibitors.
some examples of allosteric modifiers:

Question 9,vanillyl mandelic acid is excreted in urine in which of the following conditions?,"a) pheochromocytoma
b) Alkaptonuria
c) carcinoid syndrome
d) Diabetic ketoacidosis","• vanillyl Mandelic Acid is the end product of catabolism of catecholamines and is excreted in urine in pheochromocytoma.
• vMA is the urinary product of both epinephrine and norepinephrine.
• In pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma, there is an excessive synthesis of catecholamines which causes enhanced synthesis of vMA and its excretion in the urine.
• It is a good screening test for pheochromocytoma and is also used to diagnose and follow up neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma.",,A,
Question 10,which of the following statements is true about vitamin K?,"a) Deficiency of vitamin K leads to hypercoagulability.
b) It is a water soluble vitamin.
c) prolonged use of antibiotics leads to vitamin K deficiency.
d) Menaquinone is the dietary source of vitamin K found in green vegetables.","prolonged use of antibiotics leads to vitamin K deficiency. This is due to the loss of normal bowel flora that synthesizes menaquinones (vitamin K2).
vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin. The following are the vitamers of vitamin K:
• phylloquinone (vitamin K1) is the normal dietary source of vitamin K that is found in green vegetables.
• Menaquinones (vitamin K2) are synthesized by intestinal bacteria.
• Menadione (vitamin K3) is a synthetic compound that is metabolized to phylloquinone.",,C,
Question 11,what do chaperones assist in?,"a) Ubiquitinization of proteins
b) protein modification
c) protein folding
d) protein cleavage","chaperones assist in protein folding.
chaperones are heat shock proteins. They bind to the short sequences of hydrophobic amino acids of an extended polypeptide. Thus, they shield the new polypeptide being synthesized from aggregating. This provides the polypeptide an opportunity to form an appropriate secondary structure.
when a protein is thermodynamically trapped in a misfolded dead-end form, chaperones can rescue the protein by unfolding their hydrophobic ends. Thus, they provide the protein a second chance to fold productively.",,C,
Question 12,Defective fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase enzyme is associated with _____.,"a) Type 1 Tyrosinemia
b) Type 2 Tyrosinemia
c) Type 3 Tyrosinemia
d) Type 4 Tyrosinemia","Defective fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase enzyme is associated with type I tyrosinemia (tyrosinosis). It is the most common type of tyrosinemia.
There are three types of tyrosinemias:
• Type 1 (Hepatorenal tyrosinemia): Fumaryl acetoacetate hydrolase deficiency
• Type 2 (oculocutaneous tyrosinemia/Richner-Hanhart syndrome): Tyrosine transaminase deficiency
• Type 3 (Neonatal tyrosinemia)",,A,
Question 13,A newborn baby refuses breast milk since the 2nd day of birth but accepts glucose water. He develops vomiting and severe jaundice by the 5th day. Benedict's test was positive for urine and blood glucose was low. The most likely cause is due to the deficiency of,"a) Aldose reductase
b) Galactokinase
c) Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase
d) UDp galactose-4-epimerase","The above clinical features on ingestion of breastmilk at birth suggest classical galactosemia, a disorder of galactose metabolism. Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency leads to classical galactosemia.
It is an autosomal recessive disorder. clinical features include:
• Accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate in the liver causes liver damage & leads to hepatomegaly, vomiting, convulsions.
• Accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate depletes the liver of inorganic phosphate leading to diminished ATP synthesis which affects gluconeogenesis resulting in hypoglycemia.
• Accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate in the nerves causes intellectual disability.
• Accumulation of galactitol in the lens causes an oil-drop cataract.
urinary reducing sugar (Benedict's test) and the Mucic acid test are positive.
Treatment is a galactose-free diet.

Question 14,A 45-year-old woman with hypertriglyceridemia is considered for niacin therapy. she is a known diabetic managed adequately with sugars well under control. why should niacin be used cautiously in this patient?,"a) It can cause hyperglycemia.
b) It can cause scleroderma which makes injecting insulin difficult.
c) It can increase the metabolism of oral hypoglyemic drugs.
d) It can cause hypoglycemia.","Niacin should be used cautiously in diabetics as it can cause hyperglycemia.
Niacin induces insulin resistance and also decreases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which may result in severe hyperglycemia. when niacin is prescribed for patients with known or suspected diabetes, blood glucose levels should be monitored at least once a week.",,A,
Question 15,which of the following can alter the gene expression by methylation and acetylation but not change the gene sequence?,"a) Mutation
b) Epigenetics
c) Translocation
d) Inversion","Epigenetics is defined as heritable changes in gene expression that are not caused by alteration in gene sequence.
It means “above genetics” and refers to the fact that gene regulatory mechanisms do not change the underlying regulated DNA sequence, but rather simply the expression patterns of the DNA.
Epigenetic mechanisms play a key role in establishment, maintenance, and reversibility of transcriptional states. A key feature is that the controlled transcriptional on/off states can be maintained through multiple rounds of cell division. This observation indicates there must be robust mechanisms to maintain and stably propagate these epigenetic states.
Histone Methylation Mostly Makes DNA Mute.
Histone Acetylation: Relaxes DNA coiling, allowing for transcription. Histone Acetylation makes DNA Active.",,B,
Question 16,The flipped LDH ratio implies .,"a) LDH 1 > LDH 2
b) LDH2 > LDH1
