Q1,A 5 year old boy fell on his outstretched hand. X-ray is shown below. which of the following vessel is most commonly affected?,"a)Radial artery
b)Brachial artery
c)ulnar artery
d)Cubital vein","The given X-ray shows a supracondylar fracture of the humerus and injury to the brachial artery is the most common vascular complication.
The fracture most commonly caused by a fall on an outstretched hand in a child is the
supracondylar fracture of the humerus. As the hand strikes the ground, the elbow is forced into hyperextension resulting in a fracture of the humerus above the condyles.
• The brachial artery is usually injured by the sharp edge of the proximal fragment.
• sometimes flexor muscles of the forearm - flexor pollicis longus and flexor digitorum profundus (medial-half) may suffer ischemic damage leading to volkmann's ischemia leading to
compartment syndrome.
while injury to the brachial artery is the commonest vascular complication, however, malunion is the most common complication of supracondylar fracture of the humerus.


other delayed complications:
• Malunion - cubitus varus / Gunstock deformity



• volkmann’s ischaemic contracture
• Myositis ossificans",5215-3269.PNG,B,5224-3276.PNG
Q2,True regarding Galeazzi fracture-dislocation:,"a)Radial collateral ligament tear with interosseous membrane tear with radial shaft fracture
b)Interosseous membrane tear with ulnar shaft fracture
c)Interosseous membrane tear with triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear and radial shaft fracture
d)Interosseous membrane tear with triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear and ulnar shaft fracture","Galeazzi fractures consist of a fracture of the radial shaft (lower one-third) with dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ).
Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex (TFCC)
The TFCC serves as the medial continuation of the distal articular surface of the radius as well as a static stabilizer of the DRUJ.
It consists of:
• Articular disc
• Dorsal radioulnar ligament - primary stabilizer
• palmar radioulnar ligament - primary stabilizer
• The meniscus homologue
• The ulnar collateral ligament
• The sheath of the extensor carpi ulnaris
other options:
option A: Mentions radial collateral ligament but TFCC consists of the ulnar collateral ligament. options B and D: Mention ulnar shaft fracture when Galeazzi fracture is a radial shaft fracture.
Note: Galeazzi # are more common than Monteggia # and may be associated with ulnar nerve damage.",,C,
Q3,"A 25-year-old male presented to the emergency department with pain and swelling of the
right knee. The radiograph showed the following finding. what is the best treatment for the given condition?","a)Tension band wiring with K-wires
b)Tension band wiring with cancellous screws
c)cylinder cast
d)patellectomy","The radiograph shows a displaced patellar fracture. The best treatment for the given condition is tension band wiring with K- wires. In this method, two K-wires are used to transfix the reduced   patellar fragments and a flexible wire is looped around them tightly.





Treatment options for patellar fracture are:
• undisplaced patellar fractures with minimal joint incongruity and intact extensor retinaculum
- cylinder cast
• Displaced patellar fractures - tension band wiring
• severely comminuted fractures with difficulty in reducing fragments - patellectomy
Note: Tension band wiring with cancellous screw is done when compressive forces are also needed along with tensile forces to resist the displacement of fractures e.g., olecranon fractures.",5216-3270.PNG,A,5226-3277.PNG
Q4,which of the following movements is being tested in the picture given below?,"a)Internal rotation of hip
b)Abduction
c)Flexion
d)External rotation of hip","External rotation of hip is being tested in the given image.
Rotatory movements of the hip joint can be measured with the knee flexed or extended. However, more precise measurements are obtained when the rotation is tested with the flexed knee. The
procedure involves the following steps.
• The patient is made to lie supine.
• The examiner holds the knee with one hand and ankle with the other hand.
• The knee and hip are flexed to 9o degrees.
• Rotation movement is produced at the hip joint by stabilising the knee and moving the leg as the lever.
• If the hip is rotated such that the leg moves medially, external rotation of the hip occurs.
• If the hip is rotated such that the leg moves laterally, internal rotation of the hip occurs.",5217-3272.PNG,D,5227-3279.PNG
Q5,which is the classification system used for the fracture shown in the x-ray given below?,"a)schatzker classification
b)Ideberg classification
c)Neer classification
d)Gartland classification","The given image is of the fracture of the proximal humerus. The most widely accepted
classification is the Neer classification, which involves 4 major segments in injuries:
• Head of humerus
• Greater tuberosity
• Lesser tuberosity
• shaft of humerus
Neer classi■cation distinguishes between the number of displaced fragments, with displacement de■ned as greater than 45 degrees of angulation or 1 cm of separation.




other options
option A: The schatzker classification is a method of classifying tibial plateau fractures.
option B: The Ideberg classification is a method of classification of intra-articular glenoid fossa fractures.
option D: The Gartland classification is a method of classification of supracondylar fractures of the humerus.",5217-3271.PNG,C,5227-3278.PNG
Q6,An elderly male presented with a history of fall on outstretched hand following which he developed swelling of the wrist. His X-ray is shown below. what is your diagnosis?,"a)Fracture scaphoid
b)Fracture scaphoid with perilunate dislocation
c)Fracture hamate
d)Fracture capitate","The above X-ray shows fracture scaphoid.
scaphoid fractures account for almost 75 percent of all carpal fractures although they are rare in the elderly and in children.
Mechanism of injury- The combination of forced carpal movement and compression, as in a fall on the dorsiflexed hand.
Diagnostic sign- precisely localized tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox.
X-ray-
• Anteroposterior, lateral and oblique views are all essential
• often a recent fracture shows only in the oblique view.
• usually, the fracture line is transverse, and through the narrowest part of the bone (waist), but it may be more proximally situated (proximal pole fracture).
old, un-united fractures have hard borders, making it seem as if there is an extra carpal bone.
• Relative sclerosis of the proximal fragment is pathognomonic of avascular necrosis.
NoTE: The distal fragment, unrestrained by the scapholunate ligament, flexes and the proximal fragment tilt dorsally with the lunate (a DIsI deformity). The hump-backed deformity of the
scaphoid is permanent.",5218-3273.PNG,A,
Q7,Gustillo anderson classification type IIIb is?,"a)open fracture, wound more than 1 cm , less than 1o cm in length without extensive soft tissue damage, flaps, avulsions
b)open fracture, wound less than 1 cm in length without extensive soft tissue damage, flaps, avulsions
c)open fracture, wound more than 1o cm in length with extensive soft tissue loss and periosteal stripping and bone damage
d)open facture, wound more than 1o cm in length associated with an arterial injury",An open fracture with a wound with extensive soft tissue loss and periosteal stripping and bone damage belongs to classification IIIB.,,C,
Q8,"An overweight man (9o kg) presented with complaints of not being able to squat and rest
pain of left hip for 6 months duration. He had a past history of steroid and creatine use. His X-ray revealed destruction of the articular surface of femoral head with the presence of
subchondral cysts and positive crescent sign. His MRI is suggestive of marrow edema. what is your diagnosis?","a)Tuberculosis of hip
b)Fracture neck of femur
c)osteochondroma of femur
d)osteonecrosis of femoral head","The complaints of hip pain in an overweight man with a history of long-term steroid use along
with the radiological findings of subchondral cysts and positive crescent sign in the femoral head are characteristic of osteonecrosis of the femoral head.



Avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis is a painful bone condition that results from diminished blood supply mainly due to trauma or non-traumatic etiologies. Alcohol, corticosteroids,
immunosuppressives, and cytotoxic drugs, either singly or in combination, are the most common causes of non-traumatic osteonecrosis. The typical features are pain with movements in or near
the joint, click in the joint, joint stiffness, limping gait, and deformity. Restriction of movements is also a feature of this condition.
An x-ray shows reactive new bone formation, increased radiolucency in the subchondral bone,
and a distorted articular surface. The crescent sign is a subchondral fracture overlying the necrotic segment of the femoral head seen on radiography. MRI is the investigation of choice in early
disease. It allows the identification of AVN of the femoral head and also determines the exact stage and extent of the pathologic process.


Management is based on Ficat and Arlet classification:
other options:
option A: Tuberculosis of the hip is characterized by painful and restricted movements of the hip, especially at night. The radiographic findings are not appreciable in the early stages. Later stages   show periarticular osteoporosis, hazy and irregular joint margins with a reduction in the joint
space, and wandering acetabulum.

2b	X-ray: crescent sign, no colla pse	surgical decompressi on	core decompression
3	collapse+loss of sphericity	surgical	osteotomy
4	Advanced arthritis	Reconstructive	Total hip replaceme nt







option B: Fracture neck of femur is common in elderly people after a trivial fall due to
osteoporosis. Examination reveals tenderness in the groin along with shortening and external
rotation of the leg. xrays show a break in shenton’s line and trabecular stream, overriding of
greater trochanter so that it lies at the level of the head of the femur, and external rotation of the femur is evident by prominent lesser trochanter.


option C: osteochondromas are common benign bone tumors commonly present in adolescents. The lesions consist of a bony mass, often in the form of a stalk, produced by endochondral
ossification of a growing cartilaginous cap. They are usually painless. The common sites of involvement are the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus.",,D,5229-3280.PNG;5230-3282.PNG;5230-3281.PNG;5231-3283.PNG
Q9,All of the following are associated with sprengel shoulder except?,"a)Diastematomyelia
b)klippelfeil syndrome
c)Dextrocardia
d)congenital scoliosis","Dextrocardia is not associated with sprengel deformity.
sprengel deformity is the congenital elevation of the scapula. It is the most common congenital shoulder abnormality.
The scapula is abnormally small and too high. sometimes the clavicle is affected as well. shoulder movements may be restricted and on abduction or elevation, the scapula moves very little or not    at all.
sprengel’s deformity may be associated with other defects of the cervical spine (e.g. klippel–Feil syndrome), and high thoracic kyphosis or scoliosis is quite common.
The high scapula may still be attached to the spine by a tough ■brous band or a cartilaginous bar (the omovertebral bar). Associated vertebral or rib anomalies are quite common.
An unappreciated association between sprengel anomaly and diastematomyelia (congenital
splitting of spinal cord) of the lumbar spine also raises questions about the embryologic origin of the scapula.
Associations of sprengel deformity of shoulder
• klippel-Feil syndrome
• spina Bifida and Diastematomyelia
• kyphosis or scoliosis
• Torticollis
• underdevelopment of clavicle or humerus",,C,
Q10,A man with a pop cast for forearm fracture is prescribed analgesics. The earliest way to check for compartment syndrome is to look for:,"a)Disappearance of pulse by displacing the cast
b)Discolouration of fingers
c)Decreased response to analgesics
d)odour and discharge","Decreased response to analgesia → suspect compartment syndrome.
pain is the most common initial symptom in case of compartment syndrome. Red flags for
compartment syndrome are pain out of proportion with the injury, and pain on passive stretch of the digits.
Later signs include pallor, paresthesia, paralysis, and pulselessness.
As the ischemia occurs at capillary level in compartment syndrome, pulses may still be felt and skin may not appear pale.",,C,
Q11,which of the following is not true about the posterior cruciate ligament:,"a)Extra synovial
b)prevent the posterior displacement of tibia
c)primary action is to prevent the internal rotation of knee joint
d)Attached to anterolateral aspect of medial condyle","The lateral collateral ligament, not the posterior, is responsible for preventing the internal rotation of the knee joint
The posterior cruciate ligament (pCL) is an intra-articular but extra-synovial structure because of the presence of a synovial sheath that lines the ligament. It is the only primary restraint to
posterior translation throughout the entire knee range of motion. It prevents the internal rotation of the tibia on the femur when there is varus stress on the knee.
It acts as a secondary restraint to valgus/varus, external rotation.

Q12,"A patient presented with lower limb weakness. The examiner places one hand under the
patient's heel and the patient is then asked to raise his other leg against downward resistance. what is the test being performed?","a)Hoover’s Test
b)Mc Bride Test
c)waddell’s Test
d)o’Donoghue’s Test","The test being performed by the examiner is Hoover's test. This test is useful in differentiating between the organic and functional causes of limb weakness.
Hoover's test involves the following steps:
• The examiner places both their hands under the heels of the patient.
• The patient is asked to flex the affected hip while keeping the knee extended.
• Downward pressure in the healthy limb is felt by the examiner in an organic cause of limb  weakness and in healthy individuals. This pressure is not felt in the functional cause of limb weakness and malingering.
In a normal individual, when raising one leg by flexing at the hip, the other limb exerts a downward pressure which can be felt at the ankle.





The McBride's test, waddell’s test, and o’Donoghue’s test are other examination techniques that help in distinguishing between organic and non-organic causes of lower back pain.",,A,5234-3285.PNG
Q13,March fracture is seen in the ____ of second metatarsal bone.,"a)Head
b)Neck
c)shaft
d)Base","March fracture/stress fracture is seen most commonly in the neck of the second metatarsal bone. It results from long, repeated stresses like prolonged walking or running, usually seen in military men, athletes, and dancers. They may complain of gradual onset of pain over the 2nd metatarsal
neck starting 2-4 weeks after the beginning of stressors. on examination, a tender lump may be noted. The x-ray may be normal initially but later show a hairline crack. After a period of 4-6
weeks, a mass of callus can be identified.
Management: Reduction and splinting are not necessary as it is an undisplaced fracture. Normal walking is permitted while using an elastic bandage on the forefoot.
The below image shows a March fracture of the second metatarsal bone.





Note: According to campbell orthopedics (14th edition) in March fractures, patients often note the gradual onset of pain directly over the second metatarsal neck region. In uptodate, it is
mentioned that many of the stress fractures occur in the second metatarsal shaft, especially at the neck. Hence, neck is considered a more correct answer than shaft.",,B,5235-3286.PNG
Q14,Identify the name of the instrument given below:,"a)Bent Hohmann retractor
b)Bone holding forceps
c)Bone distractor
d)Bone curette",The image shows a bone holding forceps.,5221-3274.PNG,B,
Q15,"A patient came to the casualty after a RTA with fracture of femur. on 3rd day of admission, he developed sudden breathlessness. which of the following is the most common cause?","a)Hypovolemic shock
b)pulmonary hypertension
c)post trauma MI
d)Fat embolism","History of sudden onset breathlessness on the 3rd day of admission after femur fracture should raise suspicion of fat embolism.
Fat embolism is the presence of fat globules in vital organs and peripheral circulation after a
fracture of the long bone or other major trauma. Its pathogenesis can be related to 2 factors: the  release of free fatty acids by the action of lipases on the neutral fats and the actual obstruction of small pulmonary vessels by fat globules.
clinical features:
• Early signs are fever and tachycardia
• presenting features are of 2 types -
• cerebral type - drowsiness, restlessness, disorientation
• pulmonary type - tachypnoea, tachycardia
• classical triad -
•  Respiratory distress



•  Neurological abnormalities
•  petechial hemorrhages
• pathognomonic signs are petechiae on the trunk, axillae, conjunctival folds, and retina. Treatment of fat embolism is mainly supportive as given below:
• Respiratory support with oxygen
• Heparinization increases lipoprotein lipase activity
• Intravenous low molecular weight dextran
• corticosteroids to avoid pneumonitis
• prompt stabilization of long-bone fractures",,D,
Q16,"Hand, knee gait in polio paralysis is due to weakness of the _________.","a)popliteus
b)Quadriceps
c)Gastro-soleus
d)Gluteus maximus","polio commonly affects the quadriceps. The weakness of the quadriceps leads to the buckling
(bending) of the knee while walking or bearing weight on the leg. So, in order to walk, the person has to prevent the buckling of the knee by supporting with the hand, producing a hand-knee gait.
Few important examination findings in paralytic polio:
• Asymmetric: involvement of affected muscles is haphazard.
• Most common muscle affected: Quadriceps, often partially paralyzed.
• Most common muscle to undergo complete paralysis: Tibialis anterior
• Most common muscle in hand: opponens pollicis
• Motor paralysis is not associated with sensory loss.
• In the knee, triple deformity in severe cases: flexion, posterior subluxation, and external rotation",,B,
Q17,The most common sequela of traumatic dislocation of the shoulder in young adults is_____.,"a)subscapular tendinitis
b)Rotator cuff injury
c)Recurrent dislocation of shoulder
d)Frozen shoulder","The most common sequela of traumatic shoulder dislocation in young adults is recurrent dislocations of the shoulder joint.
Traumatic shoulder dislocation is associated with tear of the glenoid labrum (Bankart lesion).
This results in loss of attachment of the inferior glenohumeral ligament, which is the primary static stabilizer of the shoulder.
In addition, there is a loss of concavity due to damage to the labrum. Therefore, the shoulder joint becomes unstable. This predisposes the person to repeated shoulder dislocations. Shoulder
instability/recurrent dislocation is an indication for surgical intervention.",,C,
Q18,"After a fracture, the growth of callus will be increased by which of the following?","a)strict immobilization
b)Repeated tiny movements at the fracture site
c)Intermedullary nail
d)K wire fixation","Micro-movements at the fracture site stimulate callus formation.
other options:
option A: It is not necessary to immobilize all fractures (e.g., fracture ribs, scapula, etc) as they heal anyway. some other fractures need strict immobilization (e.g., fracture of the neck of the    femur) and may still not heal.
options C, D: kirschner wires (k-wire) and intra-medullary nails are used when a fracture is so  unstable that it is difficult to maintain it in an acceptable position by nonoperative means. They are used in order to secure rigid immobilization. They do not affect the growth of the callus
directly.",,B,
Q19,Haglund deformity is seen around which of the following joints?,"a)Knee
b)Ankle
c)wrist
d)Elbow","Haglund deformity, pump bump, or Mulholland deformity is seen around the ankle joint. It refers to retrocalcaneal exostosis formed at the posterosuperior aspect of the calcaneum.
retrocalcaneal bursa usually protects the Achilles tendon from the calcaneal tuberosity. But in
Haglund deformity, there is chronic inflammation of this retrocalcaneal bursa due to increased or repetitive chafing between the tuberosity and Achilles tendon. Due to prolonged inflammation,
degenerative changes occur and osteophytes form within the tendon leading to calcification at the site of the tendon insertion.  This leads to deformity and pain symptoms.
Management is usually conservative, using a heel lift, silicone pads in closed shoes, ice
application, anti-inflammatory drugs, and stretching exercises of the calf.
The image below shows the Haglund deformity.",,B,5237-3287.PNG;5238-3289.PNG
Q20,An elderly patient slipped in the bathroom and sustained injury over the left hip. The radiograph is shown below. His attitude of the leg will be:,"a)shortened and abducted
b)Lengthened and internally rotated
c)shortened and externally rotated
d)Flexed, adducted and internally rotated","The history of fall and hip injury in an elderly patient along with the radiological findings of a     broken shenton's line is suggestive of a neck of femur fracture. In this condition, the attitude of the leg will be shortened and externally rotated and movements of the hip joint will be painful.
A plain radiograph may show the following features:
• Fracture line in the neck of femur
• External rotation of the femur with the lesser trochanter appearing more prominent
• Displacement of the greater trochanter
• Break in the trabecular stream
• Break in shenton's line",5223-3275.PNG,C,5238-3288.PNG
