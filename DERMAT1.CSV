Q1,The histopathological slide given below is suggestive of:,"a)psoriasis vulgaris
b)Leishmaniasis
c)Mycosis fungoides
d)pemphigus vulgaris","The given slide shows a row of tombstones appearance, which is classically seen in pemphigus vulgaris.
In this condition, there is a suprabasal splitting of the epidermis leading to blister formation. The basal layer remains adherent to the basement membrane and gives the resemblance to a row of    tombstones as shown in the histology image below.


pemphigus vulgaris is a chronic immunobullous disorder characterized by the presence of
antibodies against desmosomal proteins, desmogleins 1 and 3 expressed in the skin and mucosa. Clinically, the patients present with ill-defined, irregular, slow-to-heal oral lesions and
erosions. Flaccid blisters filled with clear fluid may arise on normal skin or an erythematous base. The rupture of such blisters produces painful erosions and heals without scarring.
Nikolsky's sign is positive which is elicited by applying firm tangential sliding pressure with a finger on lesional or perilesional skin. This leads to the separation of the normal■looking
epidermis from the dermis, producing erosion.
Direct immunofluorescence is considered the most accurate confirmatory test of this condition. It shows intercellular IgG and C3 deposition on the surface of keratinocytes throughout the
epidermis in normal, perilesional skin, in a characteristic fishnet/chickenwire appearance as seen below.",3524-2200.PNG,D,3529-2206.PNG;3530-2207.PNG
Q2,A 23-year-old patient came with complaints of non-scarring alopecia in the vertex region of his head. Histological examination shows loss of hair with haemorrhage into the follicular    areas and mild perinuclear lymphocytic infiltrate. what is the diagnosis?,"a)Alopecia areata
b)Telogen effluvium
c)Tinea infection
d)Trichotillomania","The clinical scenario depicting a young adult presenting with non-scarring alopecia in the vertex region and histology showing perifollicular hemorrhage is suggestive of trichotillomania
(trichotillosis).
Trichotillomania has to be differentiated from alopecia areata (option A). Trichotillomania
presents with incomplete hair loss within a patch with varying lengths of hair whereas alopecia areata shows smooth hairless patch with sparing of white hairs. Regular pitting of nails
and exclamation mark hairs are seen in alopecia areata. when the diagnosis is uncertain, a scalp biopsy can be done. perifollicular hemorrhage is characteristic of trichotillomania while
peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrate is diagnostic of alopecia areata.
Trichotillomania is classified under obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. It is characterized by recurrent body-focused repetitive behavior (hair pulling) and repeated attempts to decrease or   stop the behavior. It is commonly seen in females. The hair loss is commonly seen over the vertex  but can involve eyelashes, eyebrows, and beard.
The most effective treatment for trichotillosis is habit-reversal training (HRT).
other options:
option B: Telogen effluvium is diffuse hair loss resulting in non-scarring alopecia due to loss of telogen hairs due to fever, pregnancy, hypothyroidism or anemia.
option C: Tinea infection shows patchy hair loss, resulting in non-scarring/scarring alopecia. Easy pluckability, broken hairs and wood's lamp positivity are features.",,D,
Q3,which of the following diseases is unlikely to present with skin lesions on the shin?,"a)sarcoidosis
b)Diabetes
c)Hyperthyroidism
d)Hypothyroidism","Hypothyroidism is unlikely to present with skin lesions on shin. Myxedema (severe
hypothyroidism) and pretibial myxedema are different entities. pretibial myxedema is the infiltrative dermopathy (mucin deposition) seen over shin in Grave's disease, a type of
hyperthyroidism.
other options :
option B: Diabetes: Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is classically seen on the anterior leg.


option A: sarcoidosis: Erythema nodosum may be seen on the anterior leg.",,D,3531-2209.PNG;3531-2208.PNG
Q4,Identify the layer of skin (in the image given below) in which desmosomes are abundant.,"a)B
b)A
c)D
d)C","Desmosomes are abundant in the stratum spinosum (option C, label D in the image) layer of the epidermis of the skin.



Desmosomes are adhesion complexes in epidermis which link adjacent keratinocytes. They appear like spines on microscopy and hence this layer is also called the prickle layer. Defects of
desmosomal proteins, inherited or acquired, result in blistering disorders.",3525-2201.PNG,C,3532-2210.PNG
Q5,The following image depicts:,"a)Scabies
b)Ichthyosis
c)contact dermatitis
d)urticaria","The given image shows raised, brownish thread-like lesions in the interdigital distribution (burrows), typically seen in scabies.
scabies is an ectoparasitic infection caused in humans by sarcoptes scabiei. It is transmitted by
close personal contact. pruritis with nocturnal exacerbation and contact cases within a family
should raise the suspicion of scabies. Typical locations of lesions are the finger webs, the flexor
surfaces of the wrists, the elbows, the axillae, the buttocks and genitalia and the breasts of women (circle of Hebra). In adults, the face is often spared. pruritic papules and nodules on male
genitalia and breasts serve as valuable diagnostic clues in the absence of burrows.
Dermoscopy of the burrows shows jet■with■contrail appearance. Microscopy of scraping from burrows can be done to demonstrate mites.
A single overnight application of 5% permethrin cream from neck to toe in adults and from head  to toe in children is the drug of choice for the treatment of scabies in all ages including infants (at least 2 months old) and pregnant women. All family members, even if asymptomatic, need to be   treated simultaneously for this condition to prevent reinfection. oral ivermectin can also be used.",3526-2203.PNG,A,
Q6,"A female came with complaints of bone and joint pain. NSAIDs were prescribed. After a few days, she presents again complaining vesicobullous lesions healing to give a brownish
discoloration over the face (upper lip are","a)Malaria
b)Dengue
c)chikungunya
d)Fixed drug eruption","The patient has a history of consumption of NsAIDs, following which there is an appearance of     vesiculobullous lesions on the lips, evolving to give a brownish discolouration. The most probable diagnosis is fixed drug eruption (FDE).



A strong differential diagnosis is post-chikungunya pigmentation (pcp) of the face seen on the nose and cheeks (chik sign). However, this is not the answer because there is no antecedent      history of fever, myalgia or other symptoms suggestive of chikungunya. pcp often appears as   the fever subsides and may persist for about 3-6 months. pcp mimics melasma and may be
misdiagnosed if proper history is not taken.
The image below shows chik sign:


Fixed drug eruption (FDE) is a type of delayed hypersensitivity reaction. It is characterized by
well-defined brown, hyperpigmented plaques that may follow vesiculobullous lesions. They occur on lips, hands, legs, face, genitalia, and oral mucosa, and can cause a burning sensation. They
usually present 3o min to 8 h after drug exposure and recur at the same location on re-exposure. NSAIDs, paracetamol and co■trimoxazole are the most common drugs causing FDE.",3526-2202.PNG,D,3533-2211.PNG
Q7,Dense irregular collagen is found in:,"a)Ligaments
b)Dermis
c)Tendons
d)Bones","Dense irregular collagen is found in dermis.
Irregular connective tissue is of three types: Loose, dense and adipose. Dense connective tissue is located in regions which are under consistent mechanical stress and where protection is required for the ensheathed organs. The abundant collagen fibres in the dermis run in a haphazard
manner. This protects the skin.
It is usually present in :
• Reticular layer of the dermis
• Superficial connective tissue sheaths of the muscle and nerves
• Adventitia of large vessels
• capsules of various organs and glands (e.g, testis, sclera, periosteum, perichondrium)
on the other hand, dense regular collagen fibres are found in tendons.",,B,
Q8,A patient presented with hair loss and itching of the scalp along with mild discharge. which of the following is useful for diagnosis?,"a)Tzanck smear
b)Gram stain
c)slit skin smear
d)KOH mount","The patient has a history of itching and mild discharge and examination shows a well-demarcated patch of alopecia, with scaling and broken hair shafts. This is characteristic of tinea capitis.
Though the diagnosis is clinical, a KOH mount is used for confirmation.
scrapings from the edge of a lesion are transferred to a slide, to which KOH is added. It is then examined under the microscope for the presence of hyphae, as shown below.


Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection primarily occurring in children. clinical features of tinea capitis are patchy hair loss, scaling, tender lymphadenopathy, and in severe cases, there might be  pustules and crusting of the affected area along with sinus formation.
The clinical variants of tinea capitis are:
• Endothrix - a non-inflammatory type in which multiple black dots are present within the areas of alopecia. It is most commonly caused by T. tonsurans and T. violaceum.





• Ectothrix - a mild inflammatory type in which single or multiple scaly patches with hair loss are seen. Microsporum audouinii, M.canis, M.equinnum, and M.ferrugineum cause ectothrix
infection.
• kerion - a severe inflammatory type that presents with an inflammatory mass with thick crusting and matting of hair with pus and sinus formation. It is commonly caused by T.    verrucosum and T. mentagrophytes.


• Favus - is characterized by the presence of yellowish, cup■shaped crusts known as scutula that develop around hair follicles. It is caused by T. schoenleinii





Treatment:
• Terbinafine: &lt;1o kg- 62.5 mg; 1o-2o kg - 125 mg; &gt;2o kg- 25o mg, all given daily for 4 weeks.
• Itraconazole: 2-4 mg/kg/day for 4-6 weeks.",3527-2204.PNG,D,3534-2212.PNG;3535-2214.PNG;3535-2213.PNG;3536-2215.PNG
Q9,Identify the condition shown below:,"a)Epidermal verrucous nevus
b)congenital melanocytic nevus
c)Melanoacanthoma
d)Malignant melanoma","The image shows a child with a well-circumscribed, black, heterogenous lesion covered with hair. This is characteristic of a congenital melanocytic nevus (CMN). They may be present at birth or     develop shortly thereafter. They are benign and can be brown, black, purplish, or red, and are
usually a palpable lesion.
They can be classified based on size: small (&lt;1.5 cm), medium (1.5-19.9 cm), and large or giant (&gt;2o cm). Larger CMN have a higher risk of developing malignant melanoma.
Management of CMN depends on the size and location of the lesion. smaller nevi may be   observed, while larger nevi or those at a higher risk for complications may require surgical excision, particularly if there is a concern for malignant transformation.
Complications of CMN include neurological abnormalities (intraparenchymal melanosis is the commonest finding), malignant melanoma, and other tumors like rhabdomyosarcoma.
The images below show different melanotic skin lesions:",3528-2205.PNG,B,3537-2218.PNG;3537-2217.PNG;3537-2216.PNG
