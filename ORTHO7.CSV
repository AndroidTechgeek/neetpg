Q1,which method of measurement of scoliosis has been depicted in the image given below?,"a)cobb's angle
b)Baumann's angle
c)Ferguson angle
d)Bohler's angle","The given image depicts the measurement of the curvature of scoliosis using the cobb's angle.
Scoliosis is characterized by the lateral curvature of the spine in the coronal plane when the patient is upright. confirmation of the diagnosis is achieved through full-length lateral and  posteroanterior X-rays of the spine. A cobb's angle greater than 1o% on the radiograph is     diagnostic of scoliosis.
The measurement of cobb's angle consists of three steps:
• Locating the superior-end vertebra of the curve.
• Locating the inferior-end vertebra of the curve.
• Drawing perpendicular lines from the superior surface of the superior-end vertebra and from the inferior surface of the inferior-end vertebra and making them intersect.
The angle formed by these perpendiculars represents the degree of spinal curvature, referred to as cobb's angle.





Nash and Moe's method and perdriolle and vidal method are tools for assessing the vertebral rotation in scoliosis.
other options:
option B: Baumann's angle is the angle formed between a line drawn through the lateral epiphysis and the long axis of the humerus. Normally, it measures less than 8o degrees but increases in
cases of supracondylar fractures.


option C: Ferguson's angle is measured between the upper endplate of the S1 vertebra and a
horizontal line. A normal Ferguson angle is typically around 34 degrees. A decreased Ferguson angle can be observed in advanced spondylolisthesis.
option D: Bohler's angle is the angle formed by two lines tangent to the highest points of the anterior and posterior facets of the calcaneus. This angle is decreased in calcaneal fractures.",5329-3380.PNG,A,5329-3380.PNG;5333-3382.PNG;5334-3385.PNG;5333-3383.PNG
Q2,A 3o-year-old woman developed a tumor at the knee joint. Biopsy-image is given below. what is the most likely condition?,"a)osteosarcoma
b)Ewing's sarcoma
c)Giant cell tumour
d)osteoblastoma","The biopsy image shows multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells with scattered mononuclear cells, indicating a diagnosis of giant cell tumor (GCT)/osteoclastoma.
GCT usually affects young adults of age 2o to 4o years, with slight female predominance. It is a benign but locally aggressive tumor. It is exclusively seen in adults and affects the ends of long  bones, typically involving the epiphysis. The most common location of the tumor is the distal     femur followed by the proximal tibia.
Histologically, GCTs show uniform oval mononuclear tumor cells alongside numerous
osteoclast-type giant cells containing 1oo or more nuclei. Necrosis and mitotic activity may be prominent.




other options:
option A: Histologically, osteosarcoma shows pleomorphic tumor cells with hyperchromatic
nuclei and abundant mitoses. A definitive diagnosis requires the presence of malignant tumor
cells producing unmineralized osteoid or mineralized bone, which is typically fine and lacelike in appearance.


option B: Histologically, Ewing's sarcoma shows sheets of uniform, small, round cells with scant cytoplasm, which may appear clear because they are rich in glycogen. The presence of
Homer–wright rosettes indicates a greater degree of neuroectodermal differentiation.


option D: Histologically, osteoblastoma shows randomly interconnecting trabeculae of woven
bone, which are prominently rimmed by a single layer of osteoblasts. The stroma surrounding the neoplastic bone is composed of loose connective tissue that contains numerous dilated and
congested capillaries.",5330-3381.PNG,C,5334-3384.PNG;5335-3387.PNG;5335-3386.PNG;5336-3389.PNG
Q3,"A patient presented with pain in the hand. The joints involved were proximal interphalangeal joint, distal interphalangeal joint and first carpometacarpal joint. The wrist and
metacarpophalangeal joints were spared. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)osteoarthritis
b)Rheumatoid arthritis
c)psoriatic arthritis
d)pseudogout","The most likely diagnosis is osteoarthritis (OA) of the hand.
In OA of the hand, the joints involved are the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints (DIP &amp; PIP), and the first carpometacarpal joint (base of the thumb), while the
metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, wrist, elbow, and ankle are usually spared.
The nodules palpable in the DIP are called Heberden’s nodes, while those palpable in the PIP are called Bouchard’s nodes.


The image below shows OA of the hand:





other options:
option B: There is relative sparing of the DIP joint in rheumatoid arthritis.
option C: Psoriatic arthritis of the hands commonly involves the PIP, DIP, and
metacarpophalangeal joints.
option D: In pseudogout, the knee joint is most commonly affected, followed by the wrist, while the first metatarsophalangeal joint (podagra) is rarely affected.",,A,5336-3388.PNG;5337-3390.PNG
Q4,A 55 year old female complains oflower backache. The radiographic image of her lumbosacral spine is given below. what is the probable diagnosis?,"a)osteoporosis
b)Ankylosing spondylitis
c)Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis
d)Renal osteodystrophy","The radiographic image of an elderly female's lumbosacral spine shows ballooning of disc spaces, resulting in the characteristic biconcave appearance of vertebral bodies known as the 'codfish'
appearance, typically seen in osteoporosis.
osteoporosis is a common metabolic bone disease characterised by a diffuse reduction in bone density due to a decrease in bone mass.
Risk factors for osteoporosis include:
• Increasing age
• Female sex
• Alcohol
• smoking
• Previous history of fragility fractures
• Family history of hip fracture
• Low body mass index- less than 18.5 kg/m2
• Excessive usage of glucocorticoids



osteoporosis presents with fractures that occur without any trauma or as a result of low-impact trauma. The commonly associated fractures are fractures of the distal part of the radius (colle's fracture), fractures of the hip, and fractures of the vertebrae. In severe cases, the fracture of
vertebrae can cause kyphosis.
Radiological findings:
• A decreased vertical height of the vertebra due to collapse
• Ground glass appearance - especially in bones like pelvis
• codfish appearance - it occurs due to bulging of the disc into the adjacent vertebral bodies so that it becomes biconcave.
DEXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) is the investigation of choice for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. T-score less than -2.5 in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip indicates
osteoporosis.",5311-3361.PNG,A,
Q5,"A maid is playing with a child by spinning him while holding his hands. A few hours later, the child starts crying, does not use his arm, and does not let anybody touch him. what is the
possible diagnosis?","a)pulled elbow
b)olecranon fracture
c)Fracture head of radius
d)Elbow dislocation","The given scenario of spinning the child by holding his hands, followed by features suggesting pain and inability to use the arm, points to a diagnosis of pulled elbow.
pulled elbow or nursemaid's elbow refers to the dislocation of the radial head over the annular ligament, commonly seen in children under the age of 6 years. The mechanism of injury is
through axial traction on the extended and pronated forearm. This happens when a child is pulled, lifted, or swung by the arm.
Following the dislocation, the child holds the arm relatively immobile, with the elbow extended and the forearm pronated, and resists supination.
The diagnosis is primarily clinical, though X-rays are usually obtained to exclude a fracture.
To treat the condition, simple analgesia is administered, and while the child's attention is
diverted, the elbow is extended and pronated to relocate the radial head with a snap. This
technique is preferred over the alternative method of supination and flexion, which tends to be more painful and less successful.",,A,5339-3391.PNG
Q6,A patient was admitted to ICU 48 hours after the fracture of the femur. The saturation of    oxygen in the rebreathing unit was 1oo% but his Spo2 remained 6o%. The patient was in a state of confusion. Chest radiograph showed lung fields to be clear. what is the most likely  diagnosis?,"a)pulmonary embolism
b)Fat embolism
c)ARDS
d)occult pneumothorax","In this clinical scenario, the presence of reduced Spo2 and altered mental status in a patient presenting within 72 hours following a long bone fracture suggests the diagnosis of a fat
embolism.
Fat embolism is caused by the fat globules originating from the bone marrow following the
fracture of long bones. clinical features of fat embolism are usually seen within 72 hours. They
include tachycardia, fever, breathlessness, petechiae, confusion,and restlessness. Gurd's criteria is used for the diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome.
There is no specific diagnostic test for fat embolism. However, urine analysis to detect fat globules and monitoring of blood po2 levels are conducted.
The management of fat embolism primarily involves supportive care, including oxygen therapy and prompt stabilization of long-bone fractures.
option A: Pulmonary embolism most commonly occurs as a result of thrombi from deep vein thrombosis of the leg.
option c: Acute respiratory distress syndrome is diagnosed using the Berlin's criteria. All four of the following conditions must be met:
• It develops within 1 week of clinical insult or worsening respiratory symptoms.
• chest radiograph shows bilateral opacities consistent with pulmonary edema. These opacities are not fully explained by effusions, lobar or lung collapse, or nodules.
• The edema is not due to cardiac failure, or fluid overload.
• There is impaired oxygenation. The ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to the fraction of
inspired oxygen (Pao2/Fio2) is ≤ 3oo mmHg as assessed on 5 cm H2o of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).



option D: occult pneumothorax is a condition that is not suspected on the basis of the symptoms or plain radiography, but is detected with CT imaging. It usually follows a thoracic injury.",,B,
