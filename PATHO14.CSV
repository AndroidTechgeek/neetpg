Q1,which of the following is not a marker for gastrointestinal stromal tumors?,"a)KIT
b)sDH
c)PDGFRA
d)NRG-1","NRG-1 (Neuregulin-1) is not a marker for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).
GIST are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the abdomen, the stomach being the most
common site. They arise from the interstitial cells of cajal, the pacemaker cells of the GIT. GIST is seen in the 5th to 6th decade of life and has an equal preponderance among males and females.
Most patients present with haematemesis, melena, or vague abdominal pain. The most common indications for surgery include bleeding and obstruction.
The GIST may occur in a sporadic form or as part of familial syndromes. In sporadic GIST, the
most common mutations seen are gain-of-function mutation in KIT (75-8o%) and PDGFRA
mutation (8%). Microscopically, GIST has elongated spindle cells or plumper epithelioid cells, or a mixed pattern.
The below image shows the microscopy of GIST composed of bundles, or fascicles, of spindle-shaped tumor cells.


Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient GIST is a subset of wild-type GIST seen with carney triad or carney-Stratakis syndrome.
Imatinib can be used to treat GIST with mutations in KIT or PDGFRA. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) - deficient GIST is imatinib-resistant, so sunitinib, sorafenib, or regorafenib can be used    instead.
During surgical resection of GIST, care must be taken to prevent capsule rupture, which causes seeding of nearby tissues leading to relapse in 1oo% of the cases. If capsule rupture occurs,
adjuvant therapy with imatinib is indicated regardless of tumor extent.
other options:
option A: KIT (cD117): This is the most well-known marker for GISTs. About 85% of GISTs show mutations in the KIT gene, leading to the expression of the KIT protein on the cell surface. KIT is a receptor tyrosine kinase, and its activation is a key driver in the pathogenesis of GISTs.
option B: SDH (Succinate Dehydrogenase): SDH mutations are associated with a subset of GISTs, particularly those that are KIT and PDGFRA wild-type. Loss of SDH function is characteristic of    this subgroup, and SDH deficiency can be demonstrated through immunohistochemistry.



option C: PDGFRA (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha): Mutations in the PDGFRA gene account for approximately 5-1o% of GIsTs. similar to KIT, PDGFRA is a receptor tyrosine   kinase, and mutations in this gene can lead to the development of GIsTs.",,D,2279-1481.PNG
Q2,Identify the given histopathological image of a carcinoma of the lung.,"a)Adenocarcinoma
b)small cell carcinoma
c)squamous cell carcinoma
d)sarcoma","The microscopic image of the tissue shows an increased mucinous type of cells and its
characteristic growth along the pre-existing alveolar septa indicating adenocarcinoma of the lung.
smoking is a major risk factor for developing lung cancer. other risk factors that can contribute are industrial chemical exposure, air pollution, etc.
They are broadly divided into
• small cell lung cancer
• Non-small cell lung cancerAdenocarcinoma
• squamous cell carcinoma
• Large cell carcinoma
Though adenocarcinoma is the most common tumor of the lung in non-smokers, it can be seen in smokers as well. It is also more common in women. Adenocarcinoma of the lung occurs in the
periphery of the lung, frequently in areas of chronic scarring caused by chronic inflammatory changes.
Clinical features include cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, and symptoms due to metastasis. some lung cancers are responsible for paraneoplastic syndromes.
other options:
option B: small cell lung carcinoma is usually identified by small, round cells that lack glandular formation. It is associated with smoking and is known for its aggressive behavior and rapid
growth.




option c: squamous cell carcinoma originates in the squamous cells that line the airways and  typically shows keratinization and the formation of intercellular bridges, rather than glandular structures.


option D: A sarcoma  arises from connective tissues and not from epithelial cells, so it would not show glandular structures on histological examination.",2268-1476.PNG,A,2280-1482.PNG
Q3,Aneurysm due to excessive degradation of connective tissue is seen in which of these disorders?,"a)Marfan's syndrome
b)Ehler Danlos syndrome
c)scurvy
d)Atherosclerosis","Aneurysm due to excessive degradation of connective tissue is seen in Marfan's syndrome.
Marfan's syndrome arises from a mutation in the FBN1 gene, responsible for encoding fibrillin, a crucial protein essential for maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues and
regulating TGF-β signaling. The condition primarily affects the skeleton, eyes, and cardiovascular system. clinical manifestations commonly include tall stature, elongated fingers, bilateral lens
subluxation, mitral valve prolapse, aortic aneurysm, and potentially life-threatening aortic dissection.
cardiovascular complications pose the greatest threat to this disorder. The two primary concerns are mitral valve prolapse and dilation of the ascending aorta due to cystic medial necrosis.
progressive dilation of the aortic root and valve ring results from the loss of medial support,
leading to severe aortic incompetence. Additionally, medial weakening increases the risk of
intimal tears, which can initiate intramural hematomas. These hematomas may cleave through    layers of the aortic media, potentially causing aortic dissection. In some cases, the hemorrhage    extends extensively, from the aortic root to the iliac arteries and may ultimately rupture through the aortic wall.",,A,
Q4,A known case of hemophilia-B comes with pain and swelling of the knee joint. which of the following will be used in his management?,"a)i, ii
b)ii, iv
c)i, iii
d)ii, iii, iv","For Hemophilia B, fresh frozen plasma and cryo-poor plasma can be used.



Hemophilia B, also known as christmas Disease, occurs due to a deficiency of Factor IX, also called christmas Factor, named after the first patient identified with the disease.
Fresh Frozen plasma (FFp)contains all coagulation factors, including factor IX, and can be used to treat Hemophilia B, and cryo poor plasma is the plasma remaining after the cryoprecipitate has
been removed, and it still contains factor IX, making it useful for treating Hemophilia B.
Hemophilia is a coagulation disorder occurring due to a deficiency of clotting factor VIII
(Hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (Hemophilia B), both of which present in the same manner. The disorder is X-linked recessive, meaning males are affected, and females are asymptomatic     carriers.
patients present with ecchymoses, epistaxis, haematuria, menorrhagia, prolonged bleeding after   dental or minor surgical procedures, haemarthrosis. However, Factor IX assays are more specific to diagnose Hemophilia B.
Definitive treatment is by infusions of recombinant Factor IX.
other options:
Factor VIII: This is used in Hemophilia A, not Hemophilia B, because Hemophilia A is caused by a deficiency of factor VIII.
cryoprecipitate: This is used primarily for Hemophilia A and von willebrand disease as it is rich in factor VIII and fibrinogen, but it does not contain significant amounts of factor IX, making it  unsuitable for Hemophilia B.",,B,
Q5,"A patient presents with truncal obesity, abominal striae, poor wound healing. what is the likely cause of his symptoms?","a)Hypercortisolism
b)Addison's disease
c)Hyperestrogenism
d)Increased growth hormone","This patient with abdominal striae, truncal obesity, and poor wound healing most likely has cushing's syndrome. This is characterized by hypercortisolism.
cushing's syndrome is a group of clinical features that occur due to chronic exposure to excess
glucocorticoids of any etiology. cushing's disease is specifically cushing's syndrome occurs due to pituitary corticotrope adenoma.
Management of cushing's syndrome includes: surgical removal of the tumor followed by hydrocortisone replacement with gradual tapering is preferred.
Medical management includes metyrapone and ketoconazole.

Q7,which of the following statements about Hodgkin's Lymphoma is not true?,"a)waldeyer's ring is the most common site to be involved
b)RS cells are immunopositive for CD3o and PAX5
c)RS Cells are of B cell origin
d)Nodular sclerosis is the most common subtype and presents as a mediastinal mass","The statement that waldeyer's ring is the most common site involved in Hodgkin's Lymphoma is incorrect; the most commonly affected sites are the cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes.
The slide below shows the classic appearance of the RS cells showing the owl's eye appearance.





WHo classifies Hodgkin's lymphoma into 5 subtypes:
• Nodular sclerosis: Frequent lacunar cells
• Mixed cellularity
• Lymphocyte-rich
• Lymphocyte depletion
• Nodular lymphocyte predominance
The first 4 subtypes are considered classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. The RS cells are CD15+, PAX5 and CD3o+. The lymphocyte predominant type is considered non-classical Hodgkin's lymphoma   with CD15-, CD3o-, CD2o+, and EB -.
other options:
option B: RS cells are immunopositive for CD3o and PAX5: Reed-Sternberg cells typically express CD3o and PAX5, among other markers. These immunohistochemical markers help in confirming   the diagnosis of Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
option C: RS Cells are of B cell origin: Despite their atypical appearance, RS cells are derived from B lymphocytes, specifically from germinal center B cells.
option D: Nodular sclerosis is the most commonly present as a mediastinal mass: Nodular sclerosis is the most common subtype of Hodgkin's lymphoma and often presents with a     mediastinal mass, particularly in younger patients.",,A,Picture12.png
Q8,A patient presents to the ER with anaphylaxis. which of the following is a part of the clinical criteria to diagnose anaphylaxis?,"a)2,3,4,5
b)1,2,3,4
c)1,2,3,5
d)3,4,5","Anaphylaxis is characterised by all of the above features except for hypertension. It causes hypotension.
Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs rapidly and
affects the whole body. It is characterized by a sudden release of histamines and other chemicals



from the immune system in response to an allergen, such as certain foods, medications, insect
stings, or latex. The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to a few hours after exposure to the allergen.
clinically, anaphylaxis can present with a combination of symptoms that typically include:
• Respiratory symptoms: patients often experience wheezing and respiratory distress due to   bronchoconstriction. other signs may include shortness of breath, coughing, and a feeling of tightness in the chest.
• skin symptoms: urticaria (hives) and angioedema (swelling of the skin and mucous membranes) are common. These skin reactions usually develop rapidly, often within minutes to two hours of     exposure to the allergen.
• cardiovascular symptoms: Hypotension (low blood pressure) is a key indicator of anaphylaxis.
patients may also experience tachycardia (increased heart rate) and, in severe cases, shock.
• Gastrointestinal symptoms: Abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps can occur, particularly if the anaphylaxis is triggered by food allergens.
• Neurological symptoms: Dizziness, lightheadedness, or loss of consciousness can occur due to the sudden drop in blood pressure and reduced oxygen supply to the brain.
specific diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis include the presence of acute onset symptoms
involving the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus, or flushing, swollen     lips-tongue-uvula), plus respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheezing-bronchospasm, stridor,   reduced peak expiratory flow), or hypotension or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction    (e.g., hypotonia, collapse, syncope, incontinence). Alternatively, it can be diagnosed if two or more of the following occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen: involvement of the skin-mucosal   tissue, respiratory compromise, hypotension, or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms.
prompt treatment is critical in managing anaphylaxis. The first-line treatment is the immediate administration of intramuscular epinephrine, which counteracts the effects of histamines and
other chemicals released during the reaction. Additional treatments may include antihistamines, corticosteroids, and bronchodilators to manage symptoms and prevent further complications.
patients with a history of anaphylaxis are typically advised to carry an epinephrine auto-injector at all times and to seek emergency medical care immediately if they experience symptoms of
anaphylaxis. Long-term management may involve identifying and avoiding known allergens, as well as potentially undergoing allergen immunotherapy in certain cases.",,A,
Q9,A patient presents with a neck swelling. An excision biopsy is performed and is shown below. what is the likely diagnosis?,"a)Tuberculosis
b)sarcoidosis
c)Langerhans cell histiocytosis
d)Hodgkin's lymphoma","The given clinical scenario and the slide showing granulomatous inflammation with central caseous necrosis are suggestive of tuberculosis of cervical lymph nodes.
once Mycobacterium tuberculosis enters the macrophage, it inhibits the formation of the
phagolysosome. This allows it to replicate unchecked. M. tuberculosis recruits a host protein
coronin to block the fusion of phagosome and lysosome. Th1 response to M. tuberculosis is
mounted about three weeks following the infection. The antigen-presenting cells (Apcs) present   mycobacterial antigens to the T-cells in the lymph nodes and release IL-12 and IL-18 to cause the differentiation of T-cells into Th1 cells. Th1 cells produce IFN-γ. IFN-γ is the critical step in the



body's defense against M. tuberculosis. It acts by activating macrophages, causing phagolysosome maturation, and inducing nitric oxide synthase enzyme to form more reactive nitrogen species. It  also mobilizes anti-bacterial compounds like defensins and stimulates autophagy.
Th1 response leads to the formation of a granuloma and caseous necrosis. Macrophages that are  activated by the action of IFN-γ differentiate into epithelioid histiocytes. These are the cells that   actually aggregate to form a granuloma. some epithelioid cells may also fuse to form a giant cell.
other options:
option B: sarcoidosis: This granulomatous disease can involve lymph nodes but typically does not produce caseous necrosis. Non-caseating granulomas are more characteristic of sarcoidosis.
option C: Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis: This rare disorder involves the proliferation of
Langerhans cells and can affect lymph nodes, but it does not typically show caseous necrosis.
option D: Hodgkin's Lymphoma: This type of lymphoma often presents with lymph node
enlargement and may show Reed-sternberg cells on biopsy. Necrosis can be seen, but it is not typically caseous in nature.",2270-1477.PNG,A,
Q10,A patient was brought to the emergency following a heavy bleed and was transfused with   multiple units of blood. which of the following is not seen as a result of delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction?,"a)Cola coloured urine in the first 2 hours
b)Failure of rise in Hemoglobin level
c)Increased Indirect Bilirubin
d)Increased LDH","Cola-colored urine in the first 2 hours is not a feature of delayed transfusion hemolytic reaction. This is characteristic of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. Acute reactions present
immediately or within a few hours of transfusion with symptoms like dark urine, fever, chills, and back pain.
Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTR) occur days to weeks after a blood transfusion,
unlike acute reactions that manifest immediately or within a few hours. In DHTR, the recipient's immune system recognizes the transfused red blood cells as foreign and mounts an immune
response against them, leading to their destruction. This delayed immune response is often due to the formation of alloantibodies against minor antigens on the donor red blood cells. Clinically,
DHTR presents with symptoms such as a failure of rise in hemoglobin levels despite transfusion, increased levels of indirect bilirubin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, indicative of ongoing hemolysis. while DHTR is generally less severe than acute reactions, it can still cause significant morbidity and necessitates careful monitoring and management.",,A,
Q11,Given below is the image of a survival analysis curve in patients with organ transplants. which of the following statements are true about the graph?,"a)Both CD4 and CD8 cells take part in allograft rejection
b)Both CD4 and CD8 participate in the protection against allograft rejection
c)CD4 cells are not involved in allograft rejection
d)CD8 cells have a predominant role in graft rejection","From the given graph is it evident that with anti CD8  the increase in graft survival is negligible
compared to the control, however with anti CD4 the graft survival doubles. when anti-CD4 and     anti-CD8 are coadministered, the survival becomes four times that of control. From this, it can be inferred that both CD4 and CD8 cells take part in allograft rejection.
Rejection is a process in which T lymphocytes and antibodies produced against graft antigens react against and destroy tissue grafts. The major antigenic differences between a donor and   recipient that result in the rejection of transplants are differences in HLA alleles. Following     transplantation, the recipient’s T cells recognize donor HLA antigens from the graft by two
pathways. The graft antigens are either presented directly to recipient T cells by graft



antigen-presenting cells (APCs), or the graft antigens are picked up by host APCs, processed, and presented to host T cells. These are called the direct and indirect pathways of recognition of
alloantigens. Both lead to the activation of CD8+ T cells, which develop into cytotoxic T
lymphocytes and CD4+ T cells, which become cytokine-producing effector cells, mainly Th1 cells.
Graft rejection is classified into hyperacute, acute, and chronic, based on clinical and pathologic features :
• Hyperacute rejection is mediated by preformed antibodies specific for antigens on graft endothelial cells.
• Acute rejection is mediated by T cells and antibodies that are activated by alloantigens in the graft.
• Chronic rejection is an indolent form of graft damage that occurs over months or years, leading to progressive loss of graft function.
Methods of increasing graft survival :
In kidney transplants, there is substantial benefit if all the polymorphic HLA alleles are matched. However, HLA matching is usually not done for transplants of the liver, heart, and lungs.
Except for identical twins, immunosuppressive therapy is essential in all donor-recipient
combinations. Immunosuppressive drugs in current use include steroids (which reduce
inflammation), mycophenolate mofetil (which inhibits lymphocyte proliferation), and tacrolimus (inhibitor of calcineurin).",2271-1478.PNG,A,
Q12,A patient was brought to the emergency care following severe hemorrhage and was unable to get the matching blood type. which blood group can be used for immediate transfusion?,"a)1,2,3,4
b)2,4
c)3,4
d)1,2","In this patient who was unable to get matched donor blood, o+ve and o-ve blood types can be administered to him.
In cases of severe hemorrhage where there is an immediate need for a blood transfusion but the matching blood type is not available, both o-negative and o-positive blood can be used for
immediate transfusion, with specific considerations. o-negative blood is the universal donor type for all patients because it lacks A, B, and Rh antigens on the surface of its red blood cells,
minimizing the risk of an adverse reaction in the recipient. This makes o-negative blood particularly valuable in emergency situations where the patient's blood type is unknown.
o-positive blood, on the other hand, can also be used in emergencies but is generally preferred for transfusing Rh-positive patients to conserve the limited supply of o-negative blood for those who   are Rh-negative or when the blood type is entirely unknown. while o-positive blood is not
universally compatible with o-negative, it is still a safe option for patients who are known to be Rh-positive, thus preventing an Rh incompatibility reaction.
Blood types A+ve and B+ve are not suitable for emergency universal transfusion because they
contain A and B antigens, respectively, which can cause severe transfusion reactions if the
recipient has antibodies against these antigens. For example, if a patient with type B blood (who has anti-A antibodies) receives type A+ve blood, it can lead to a dangerous immune response.
similarly, a patient with type A blood (who has anti-B antibodies) cannot safely receive type B+ve blood.",,C,
Q13,which of the following does not differentiate between necrosis and apoptosis?,"a)Intact cell contents
b)Altered cell shape
c)Intact plasma membrane
d)Lysosomal enzymatic digestion","Necrosis and apoptosis cannot be differentiated based on the altered cell shape. They can however be differentiated based on cell size, where necrosis is associated with an enlarged cell and
apoptosis with cell shrinkage.
Necrosis is a pathologic process that is the consequence of severe injury. Necrosis is characterized by denaturation of cellular proteins, leakage of cellular contents through damaged membranes,
local inflammation, and enzymatic digestion. It is characterized by denaturation of cellular    proteins, leakage of cellular contents through damaged membranes, local inflammation, and enzymatic digestion.
Apoptosis is a type of cell death that is induced by a tightly regulated suicide program in which cells destined to die activate intrinsic enzymes called caspases that degrade the cells’ genomic    DNA and nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Apoptotic cells break up into plasma
membrane-bound fragments, called apoptotic bodies, which contain portions ofthe cytoplasm
and nucleus. while the plasma membrane remains intact, its surface components are altered. As a result, the dead cell and its fragments are rapidly devoured, before the contents leak out, and
therefore apoptosis does not elicit an inflammatory reaction.
other options :
option 1 - Apoptosis is associated with intact cellular contents, while necrosis is associated with enzymatic digestion, and contents leak out.
option 3 - Intact plasma membrane is a feature of apoptosis; however, in necrosis, there is a disrupted plasma membrane.
option 4 - Lysosomal enzymatic digestion is a feature of necrosis and not apoptosis.

CD is characterized by acute or chronic inflammation of the bowel. The most commonly involved site is the terminal ileum because of which patients present with diarrhea and right lower
quadrant pain. Extensive inflammation can result in malabsorption and steatorrhea.
Blood investigations may reveal anemia, elevated ESR and CRP. Fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin levels are used to rule out irritable bowel syndrome and as a marker of ileo-colonic inflammation. A colonoscopy is done as part of the evaluation. It shows characteristic skip lesions and a
cobblestone appearance. Biopsy shows transmural inflammation with non-caseating granulomas.

MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tumor) lymphoma is an extranodal marginal zone
lymphoma, most commonly seen in the stomach, but other common sites include the skin,
salivary glands, small bowel, ocular adnexa, and synovium. It is associated with states of chronic inflammation due to either autoimmune diseases (Sjo■gren s syndrome or Hashimoto s
thyroiditis) or chronic infections with organisms like H. pylori (gastric), Borrelia burgdorferi (skin), C. psittaci (conjunctiva), C. jejuni (intestines), and hepatitis C virus.
The essential pathologic feature of MALT lymphoma is the presence of lymphoepithelial lesions,    which result from the invasion of mucosal glands and crypts by the neoplastic lymphocytes. These cells are positive for CD19, CD2o, and CD79a and negative for CD5 and CD1o. Recurrent
cytogenetic abnormalities include t(11;18), t(14;18), t(1;14), t(3;14), and trisomy 8. The t(11;18) is most common, occurring in up to 5o% of MALT lymphomas.
unlike other indolent B-cell lymphomas, MALT lymphomas present most commonly with stage I or II disease. In these cases, radiation therapy may be curative. Alternatively, patients may
respond to antibiotics for the associated underlying infection.
Alpha heavy chain disease / immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (IPSID) is recognized as an infectious pathogen-associated human lymphoma associated with Campylobacter jejuni. It
involves mainly the proximal small intestine, resulting in malabsorption, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. IPSID is associated with excessive plasma cell differentiation and produces truncated alpha   heavy chain proteins lacking the light chains. Early-stage IPSID responds to antibiotics (3o  7o%   complete remission). Most untreated IPSID patients progress to lymphoplasmacytic and

Q16,which of the following is a nuclear neuroendocrine immunohistochemical marker?,"a)Synaptophysin
b)NCAM 1
c)INSM1
d)Chromogranin","INSM1 is a nuclear marker for neuroendocrine tumours.
Insulinoma-associated protein 1 is a nuclear protein that serves as a transcription factor and has    gained prominence as a neuroendocrine marker in pathology. originally identified in insulinomas, INSM1 has been to be a reliable marker for various neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).
other options:
option A: Synaptophysin is a glycoprotein located in the membrane of presynaptic vesicles. It is a marker for neuroendocrine cells and tumors, but it is found in the cytoplasm, not the nucleus.
option B: NcAM 1 (Neural cell Adhesion Molecule 1), also known as cD56, this marker is a cell   surface glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion. It is often used in the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors, but it is not a nuclear marker.
option D:  chromogranin A is a protein found in the secretory vesicles of neuroendocrine cells. It is another commonly used marker for neuroendocrine tumors and is located in the cytoplasm.",,C,
Q17,which of the following is incorrect regarding myelodysplastic syndrome?,"a)More commonly seen in females
b)Treatment induced MDS is not dependent on age
c)Median age of onset 7o years
d)It can be radiation induced","Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is more commonly seen in males than females.
The MDS is a heterogeneous group of hematologic disorders characterized by both cytopenias due to bone marrow failure and a high risk of development of acute myeloid leukemia. Anemia due to  ineffective erythropoiesis, often with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, is seen.
MDS is a disease of the elderly; the mean age at onset is older than 7o years (option c). There is a  slight male predominance (option A). Secondary or therapy-related MDS is not age-related (option B). It occurs as a late toxicity of cancer treatment; radiation (option D) and the radiomimetic
alkylating agents such as busulfan, nitrosourea, or procarbazine (with a latent period of 5–7
years); or the DNA topoisomerase inhibitors (2-year latency). Acquired aplastic anemia, Fanconi anemia, and other constitutional marrow failure diseases can evolve into MDS.
Anemia dominates the early course. Most symptomatic patients complain of the gradual onset of   fatigue and weakness, dyspnea, and pallor. platelets also are large and lack granules. In functional studies, they may show marked abnormalities, and patients may have bleeding symptoms despite  seemingly adequate numbers. Neutrophils are hypo-granulated; have ringed, or abnormally
segmented nuclei; contain Do■hle bodies; and may be functionally deficient. circulating
myeloblasts usually correlate with marrow blast numbers, and their quantity is important for classification and prognosis.
The bone marrow is usually normal or hypercellular, but in about 2o% of cases, it is sufficiently hypocellular to lead to confusion with aplastic anemia. The following are commonly observed:



dyserythropoietic changes (especially nuclear abnormalities) and ringed sideroblasts in the
erythroid lineage; hypogranulation and hyposegmentation in granulocytic precursors, with an
increase in myeloblasts; and megakaryocytes showing reduced numbers of or disorganized nuclei.
only hematopoietic stem cell transplantation offers a cure for MDS. The hypomethylating agents azacitidine and decitabine are frequently used in bone marrow failure clinics. Lenalidomide, a
thalidomide derivative with a more favorable toxicity profile, is particularly effective in reversing anemia in MDS patients with 5q– syndrome.",,A,
Q18,which among the following is not a growth-promoting oncogene?,"a)FGF
b)PDGF
c)TGF beta
d)TGF alpha","TGF beta is not a growth-promoting oncogene among the listed options.
TGF beta (Transforming Growth Factor beta) primarily acts as a regulatory molecule In normal  cells, TGF beta functions mainly as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death), and promoting differentiation. It helps maintain tissue
homeostasis and prevents the uncontrolled cell growth that can lead to cancer. In the early stages of tumorigenesis, TGF beta exerts anti-proliferative effects.
FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) is a family of growth factors involved in various processes,
including angiogenesis, wound healing, and embryonic development. Some members of the FGF family can act as oncogenes, meaning they promote cell proliferation and survival, which can
contribute to the development and progression of cancers. (option A)
PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor) is another crucial growth factor that regulates cell growth and division. In the context of cancer, PDGF is often implicated due to its role in promoting
cellular proliferation and survival. Dysregulation of PDGF signaling pathways is commonly
observed in various tumors, making it a significant contributor to oncogenesis. (option B)
TGF alpha (Transforming Growth Factor alpha) is a growth factor that binds to the EGF
(Epidermal Growth Factor) receptor, promoting cell proliferation and survival. TGF alpha is
frequently overexpressed in various types of cancers, where it stimulates the growth of tumor
cells. Its ability to drive cellular proliferation through the activation of EGF receptors classifies it as a growth-promoting oncogene, contributing to the malignancy of cancers where it is
overexpressed.(option D)",,C,

Medullary thyroid carcinoma is a tumor of parafollicular (c cells) derived from the neural crest. Histological analysis shows characteristic amyloid stroma. High levels of calcitonin and
carcinoembryonic antigen are produced by many medullary tumors.
Hepatoblastoma presents as an asymptomatic mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. It mostly arises from the right lobe of the liver. patients have non-specific symptoms such as
fever, fatigue, weight loss, and anorexia. A biopsy of the liver mass is necessary to make the diagnosis. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFp) is a useful tumor marker that is used in diagnosis and     monitoring.
choriocarcinoma is a type of mixed germ cell tumor. It is highly vascular. Histologically, the     tumor shows syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts. It secretes large quantities of human  chorionic gonadotropin (hcG) hormone, which is used as a tumor marker in the diagnosis and management of the tumor.
pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting tumor derived from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. It most commonly presents as a classic triad of intermittent headache,
palpitation, and profuse sweating, along with hypertension.

Q22,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition induced by which pair of transcription factors?,"a)TF IIA &amp; TF IIB
b)cathepsin &amp; MMP8
c)SNAIL &amp; TWIST
d)STAT-5 &amp; HIF- 1alpha","Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is induced by SNAIL &amp; TWIST.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process where epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and adhesion properties, transitioning into a more motile mesenchymal cell phenotype. This is
critical in embryogenesis, wound healing, and cancer metastasis.
SNAIL and TWIST encode transcription factors whose primary function is to promote
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). SNAIL and TWIST downregulate E-cadherin expression.
• In EMT, carcinoma cells downregulate certain epithelial markers (e.g., E-cadherin) and upregulate certain mesenchymal markers (e.g. vimentin and smooth muscle actin).
• This favors the development of a promigratory phenotype that is essential for metastasis.
• Loss of E-cadherin expression seems to be a key event in EMT.
• EMT has been documented mainly in breast carcinoma
other options:
option A: TF IIA &amp; TF IIB: These are general transcription factors involved in the assembly of the transcription initiation complex, not specific to EMT.
option B: Cathepsin &amp; MMP8: These are proteolytic enzymes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, which may assist invasion during EMT but do not directly induce it.
option D: STAT-5 &amp; HIF-1α: While these factors are involved in cellular responses to cytokines and hypoxia, respectively, they are not directly linked to the initiation of EMT.",,C,
Q23,A young child presents with bleeding gums and bruising for two weeks. Bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry were done. What is the diagnosis?,"a)AML
b)CLL
c)ALL: B Phenotype
d)ALL: T phenotype","Bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry are suggestive of ALL: B Phenotype.
In B ALL, the cells show markers such as intracellular tdt, CD 22, CD 19, and CD 1o on flow
cytometry. Tdt represents that the cells are blasts, and CD 1o, 19, and 22 represent that cells are B cells.
Peripheral smear shows lymphoblasts that have condensed chromatin, less conspicuous nucleoli, and scant basophilic cytoplasm, which lacks granules.
ALL is the most common cancer in childhood. B-cell ALLs usually present as early childhood leukemias, while T-cell ALLs are usually seen in adolescents as thymic lymphomas. Clinical    features include fatigue, infections, bleeding diathesis (due to impaired marrow function),
hepatosplenomegaly, fever, and dyspnea due to mediastinal or thymic infiltration.
Initial evaluation involves a routine complete blood count and peripheral smear. It typically
reveals anemia, thrombocytopenia, and the presence of blasts (immature WBCs) on the smear. Morphologically, myeloblasts and lymphoblasts may be difficult to distinguish.
Immunophenotyping thus plays an important role in confirming the diagnosis.
other options:
option A: Acute myeloid leukemia leads to the accumulation of immature myeloid blasts in the
marrow, resulting in marrow failure and complications related to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and



neutropenia. Bone marrow/peripheral smear shows a large, uniform population of cells
(myeloblasts) with prominent nucleoli. It shows the presence of primary cytoplasmic granules. Auer rods are Needle-shaped azurophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies particularly seen in acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML M3) with t(15;17).


option B: CLL is associated with the deletions of 13q, 11q, 17q, and trisomy 12q. Lymph nodes are diffusely effaced by small lymphocytes with proliferation centers. The peripheral smear shows
small round lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm and smudge cells as seen below.


option D: In T ALL, the cells show markers such as intracellular tdt, CD 1, CD 2, CD 5, and CD 7 on flow cytometry. Tdt represents that the cells are blasts, CD 1, CD 2, CD 5 and CD 7 represent   that cells are T cells.",2275-1480.PNG,C,2295-1486.PNG;2295-1485.PNG;2152-1408.PNG
Q24,A patient presents with a lesion on the hand. Histopathology of the lesion is given. which of the following is incorrect?,"a)The lesion arises from cranial nerve
b)verocay bodies are seen in light microscopy
c)Associated with neurofibromatosis
d)The lesion is malignant and metastasises frequently","The given clinical and histopathological features are suggestive of schwanomma, and they are benign and not malignant and do not metastasise frequently.
schwannomas are benign tumors that often arise from cranial (option A) and peripheral nerves and exhibit schwann cell differentiation. They can be sporadic or associated with
neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) or occur as vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) in cases of neurofibromatosis-2 (NF2) (option C).
They present with features of nerve compression involving both the adjacent structures and the    nerve involved. Most tumors occur in the cranium as acoustic neuromas that affect the vestibular branch of the VIII cranial nerve near the cerebellopontine angle. They present with tinnitus,
hearing loss, and symptoms resulting from compression of the brainstem and cerebellum.
Microscopically, it consists of dense areas called Antoni A area and loose areas called Antoni B area.
• The dense eosinophilic Antoni A areas contain spindle cells that are arranged into cellular   intersecting fascicles. palisading of nuclei is seen, with the nuclear-free zones between them, called Verocay bodies (option B)
• The Antoni B areas contain spindle-shaped cells that are loosely arranged and separated by a prominent myxoid extracellular matrix.",2275-1479.PNG,D,2296-1487.PNG
Q25,"A 3o-year-old female presented with weight loss and a cough. on investigation, it was found  that she had pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, and tree-in-bud appearance on the CT scan. on aspiration of the pleural fluid sample, adenosine deaminase was low, lymphocytes were    high. what would be the finding in the aspirate of the mediastinal lymph node?","a)Necrotized epithelioid giant cells with necrosis
b)Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia
c)Fungal hyphae surrounded by lymphocytes
d)Anthracotic pigment","The given clinical presentations of weight loss, cough, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy are suggestive of tuberculosis. Tree-in-bud appearance on the CT scan and elevated lymphocytes in     the pleural fluid also point to TB. Necrotized epithelioid giant cells with necrosis would be the
finding in the aspirate of the mediastinal lymph node, which is characteristic of tuberculosis.
The given symptoms are classic symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis. Elevated ADA levels are
more commonly associated with TB-related pleural effusions. Low ADA can occur in some cases of TB-related pleural effusions. Lymphocytic pleural effusions are common in TB pleuritis.



In tuberculosis, the characteristic histological feature in involved lymph nodes would be caseating granulomas, which consist of necrotized epithelioid giant cells with central necrosis. These
granulomas are a hallmark of mycobacterial infection and are usually seen in the mediastinal lymph nodes of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis.
other options
option B: Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia is typically seen in viral infections or other causes of non-specific lymphadenopathy, but it is not typical of tuberculosis.
option C: Fungal hyphae surrounded by lymphocytes would suggest a fungal infection (e.g.,
histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis), but the overall presentation in the given scenario does not point toward a fungal infection.
option D: Anthracotic pigment is seen in the lungs and lymph nodes of individuals with chronic exposure to coal dust or pollution but is not associated with tuberculosis.",,A,

Q27,All are hereditary causes of thrombosis except?,"a)PNH
b)Protein S deficiency
c)Antithrombin deficiency
d)Homocystinuria","paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (pNH) is not a hereditary cause of thrombosis.
pNH is an acquired disorder where RBCs are deficient in membrane-bound
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GpI)- CD55 (decay accelerating factor)and CD59 (membrane
inhibitor of reactive lysis), which causes complement-mediated intravascular lysis of RBCs. It is characterised by a triad of pancytopenia with hypercellular marrow, nocturnal hemoglobinuria  (decrease in blood pH during sleep), and acquired thrombosis.
Hypercoagulable states or thrombophilias (thrombosis) can be inherited or acquired:
Inherited causes include:
• Factor V Leiden mutation
• prothrombin mutation
• protein C deficiency
• protein S deficiency (option B)
• Antithrombin III deficiency (option C)
• Homocystinuria (option D) Acquired causes include:
• Surgery
• Malignancy

Q28,which anticoagulant is used in the test tube for estimating Hba1c?,"a)warfarin
b)sodium Fluoride
c)EDTA
d)Heparin","EDTA is used in test tubes as an anticoagulant for estimating HbA1C.
EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is used for estimating HbA1c because it prevents clotting and preserves the integrity of the red blood cells for accurate measurement of glycated
hemoglobin. It is a chelating agent, that works by binding to calcium ions in the blood.
other options:
option A: warfarin is an oral anticoagulant. It is not used in blood collection tubes. It is a
therapeutic anticoagulant, not suitable for preserving blood samples for laboratory testing, such as HbA1c.
option B: Sodium Fluoride is used in grey-top tubes for blood glucose testing. It is specific for glucose preservation, not for HbA1c estimation, as it does not effectively prevent clotting or
preserve red blood cells.
option D: Heparin is used in green-top tubes to collect plasma samples. It can interfere with some analytical methods for measuring glycated hemoglobin and does not preserve red blood cells
effectively for this purpose.",,C,
Q29,Most common cause of inherited coagulopathy,"a)Factor v leiden mutation
b)Antithrombin III deficiency
c)protein C deficiency
d)prothrombin G20210A","The most common genetic cause of inherited coagulopathy is the Factor V Leiden mutation.
primary (inherited) hypercoagulability is most often caused by mutations in the Factor V and prothrombin genes. Factor V Leiden mutation is the most common cause, followed by
prothrombin G20210A mutation.
The Leiden mutation is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The mutation makes Factor
V resistant to cleavage and inactivation by protein C. This leads to the inactivation of an
important antithrombotic counterregulatory pathway.
protein C, protein S, and Antithrombin III deficiency are rare causes of primary
hypercoagulability.
other options:
option B: protein C deficiency causes thrombosis in teenagers. It may also be induced by liver dysfunction, vitamin K antagonists, renal failure, DIC, and active thrombosis.
option C: Antithrombin III forms a complex with thrombin by binding to heparin on endothelial  cells. This complex inhibits coagulation. Its deficiency presents as early-age thrombosis (less than 50 years old) and carries the highest risk for thrombotic events among the inherited



thrombophilias.
option D: The prothrombin G20210A mutation results in increased levels of prothrombin, which demonstrates a higher risk for arterial and venous thrombotic events.",,A,
