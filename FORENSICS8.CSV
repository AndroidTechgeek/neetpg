Q1,Arrange the following in the correct order of symptomatology seen in iron toxicity:,"a)2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 4
b)2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 1
c)3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 1
d)3 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2","The correct order of symptomatology in iron toxicity is 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt;1.
symptoms of iron toxicity are divided into 4 stages:
• stage 1 (few hours after ingestion): vomiting, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, shock, acidosis, and coma
• stage 2 (6-24 hours): Asymptomatic phase
• stage 3 (24-48 hours): Metabolic acidosis, jaundice, hypoglycemia, shock, coma with hepatic and renal failure.
• stage 4 (1-2 weeks): Late complications such as gastric stricture and pyloric stenosis.
Iron exerts its toxic effects by increasing capillary permeability, release of hydrogen ions,
inhibition of mitochondrial function, and direct corrosive action on the gastric mucosa. Ingestion of 2o to 3o grams is considered to be fatal and the fatal period is around 24-3o hours.
Desferrioxamine is the mainstay of treatment with supportive gastric lavage, administration of egg and milk to form iron-protein complexes, oral MgoH solution, and hemodialysis in severe cases.
postmortem changes in iron toxicity include:
• Hemorrhagic necrosis of gastric mucosa with perforation of gastric or jejunal wall
• Acute hepatic necrosis
• Degenerative renal tubular changes",,C,

Mechanism of injury with the above weapons
Axe - it is a heavy weapon that may or may not be sharpened. Injury is produced by chopping   action of the weapon and it may be in a spectrum of an incised wound to laceration depending upon the sharpness of the blade.
RTA - rubbing of epidermis tangential to a rough or hard surface gives rise to graze abrasion also called brush burn. It can occur in an RTA after a pedestrian is being hit by a vehicle and the
victim is slid/grazed for some distance before he comes to a halt.
Blade - it gives rise to a clean-cut wound which is usually deepest at its starting. Tailing of the  wound indicates the direction of injury. Length is the biggest parameter of this type of wound.



Lathi- It is a blunt force injury giving rise to a patterned abrasion with 2 parallel lines and a
normal unbruised area on site of impact or stick/lathi. The lathi forces the blood from the site of impact to either side which gives rise to tramline appearance.

Adipocere formation starts in 4-5 days.
Relaxation of urethral sphincter by 2-3 days.
Marbling of veins starts in 24 hours.
Liquefaction of tissues by 5-1o days.
In postmortem marbling, blood in the vessels is haemolysed to sulfmeth-hemoglobin, which stains the vessel walls and the adjacent tissues, giving rise to a marbled appearance. The marbling of the skin begins by about 24 hours and becomes prominent in 36–48 hours after death. The image
below shows postmortem marbling which is distinctly appreciable in the superficial veins of the abdomen, shoulders, chest, and inguinal region.





urethral sphincter relaxation is of two types;- primary and secondary. primary relaxation occurs before rigor mortis sets in. secondary relaxation occurs at the time of decomposition i.e. around  2-3 days.
Adipocere formation, also called corpse wax, grave wax, or mortuary wax is a late sign of death. A wax-like organic substance is formed by the anaerobic hydrolysis or hydrogenation of fat in
tissues by bacteria like clostridium welchii. It has a greyish-white appearance with a distinctive offensive or sweetish smell. In a country like India, adipocere formation begins within 4-5 days and takes several weeks to complete.
Liquefaction or colliquative changes begin 5 days after death and become prominent in 1o days. soft tissues change into semisolid masses which are black and get separated from bones and fall off.
Note: The first visible sign of putrefaction is greenish (due to sulfmeth-hemoglobin) discolouration of the anterior abdominal wall, usually in the right iliac fossa.",,A,2703-1648.PNG
Q4,which of the following is true about the the cause of the given finding?,"a)Lightning strike
b)Electrocution
c)Marbling
d)Trickling down of acid","The given finding is known as Lichtenberg's figures or filigree burns which are pathognomonic for lightning injury. It is a superficial, thin, tortuous, fern-like pattern of erythema in the skin. It
indicates the path taken by the electrical discharge and tends to follow skin creases and long axis of the body.
They are also known as arborescent burns or feathering as they have a resemblance to the
branches of a tree. Lichtenberg's figures occur due to the rupture of small vessels. They are usually seen over the shoulder or flank within an hour of injury and disappear in 1-2 days.
Medico-legal aspect: Its recognition may be lifesaving in the unaccompanied comatose patient and is important because even delayed resuscitation of lightning victims can be very successful.
Lesions seen in electrical burns or electrocution are:



• Joule burns: when the skin has been in firm contact with an electrical conductor, this may split
the layers of the epidermis or the epidermal-dermal junction and produce a raised blister, called Joule burns.
• spark lesion: when the contact is less firm, an air gap (albeit narrow) exists between skin and     conductor, the current jumps the gap as a spark. This causes the outer skin keratin to melt over a small area. on cooling, the keratin fuses into a hard brownish nodule, usually raised above the
surrounding surface, the so-called spark lesion. The heat generated by the current may melt the calcium phosphate, which is radiologically seen as typical round dense foci known as bone
pearls or wax drippings.
• crocodile skin effect is caused by high-tension current burns. In high-voltage burns, such as those sustained from high-tension grid transmission cables, where the voltage is in the
multi-kilovolt range, sparking may occur over many centimeters. This can cause multiple spark lesions giving rise to a crocodile-skin effect.

Q5,"A 24-year-old man who was accused of murder was taken into police custody. As a part of the interrogation, the prisoner was kept in a prone position with both his wrists and ankles
bound behind his back and secured with a rope. what is this method known as?","a)choke/carotid hold
b)carotid sleeper hold
c)Hog tie
d)Bar arm","This type of physical restraint in which a person is placed in prone position with his wrists and
ankles bound behind his back and secured by a rope is known as hog-tying or total appendage
restraint procedure. This can cause breathing difficulty and the person can become unresponsive. Rarely, death may occur due to asphyxia, soon following the physical restraint.


carotid hold also known as choke hold or bar arm involves placing the forearm straight across the front of the neck. The free hand grips the wrist and pulls it back causing obstruction of the airway and carotids resulting in immediate unconsciousness. Fracture of the hyoid or larynx can occur
with greater force. pressure on the carotid bodies can cause sudden cardiac arrest.





In carotid sleeper hold, also known as lateral vascular neck restraint, the arm is placed about the  neck with the antecubital fossa centered at the midline of the neck. The free hand grips the wrist   and the arm is pulled backward, compressing carotid arteries and jugular veins but not vertebral  arteries or trachea. The person loses consciousness in 1o to 15 seconds and regains consciousness within 1o to 2o seconds upon releasing the pressure. Here, the neck structures are not damaged.  Death may rarely occur due to catecholamine release or hypoxia which can trigger myocardial
infarction or dysrhythmias in patients with ischemic heart disease.",,C,2754-1666.PNG;2755-1667.PNG;2755-1668.PNG
Q6,An 18-year-old female was sexually assaulted by a 2o-year-old male. There was presence of   white stains on the clothes of the victim. Barberio's test was performed on the stains. which of the following is detected by this test?,"a)spermine
b)Acid phosphatase
c)choline
d)Fructose","Barberio's test detects the presence of spermine which is present in prostatic secretions and thus helps in the identification of seminal fluid.



In Barberio's test, a saturated aqueous or alcoholic solution of picric acid is added to the    spermatic fluid. This produces yellow needle-shaped rhombic crystals of spermine picrate.
option B: Acid phosphatase test is a quantitative test for the presence of acid phosphatase
enzyme. High levels of acid phosphatase from prostatic secretions are present in seminal stains    (The normal vaginal secretions have low levels of acid phosphatase). positive reactions are found till 36 hours after which the enzyme levels fall and disappear within 72 hours. In the absence of   demonstrable sperms or aspermia, this test can be considered conclusive.
option C: Florence test detects choline which is secreted by seminal vesicles. The
suspected seminal stain is extracted with 1o% hydrochloric acid and a drop of it is placed over a  slide. A coverslip is placed over it and a drop of Florence solution (potassium iodide, iodine, and water) is made to run under the coverslip. If semen is present, dark brown rhombic or
needle-shaped crystals of choline iodide appear immediately. The test is not confirmatory for the presence of semen, however, a negative reaction rules out the presence of semen.
option D: Fructose acts as an energy source for sperm. Its presence in seminal fluid indicates a patent efferent ductal system, as fructose will be absent in its obstruction.
The absolute proof of semen is finding at least one unbroken spermatozoon or electrophoretic LDH isoenzyme detection of sperms.",,A,
Q7,Match the following with the respective ages of fusion:,"a)A-1, B-2, C-3, D-4
b)A-4, B-1, C-2, D-3
c)A-4, B-3, C-1, D-2
d)A-1, B-4, C-3, D-2","The correct match is A-4, B-1, C-2, D-3.
The respective ages of fusion are:
• The medial end of clavicle at 21-25 years
• sacrum as a single bone at 22-25 years
• Crista scapulae at 5o years
• Lambdoid suture at 45 years
The secondary ossification center at the medial end of the clavicle appears at 18-19 years of age
and fuses by 2o-22 years of age. This occurs 2 years earlier in females. Thus the complete fusion    of the medial end of clavicle can be used for establishment of age of 21 years in medicolegal cases.
The 5 sacral vertebrae are separated by cartilage till puberty. Fusion of epiphysis begins after
puberty and ossification start from below upwards. sacrum becomes a single bone by the age of
25 years.
ossification of scapulae:
• 3o-35 years: lipping starts on ventral margin of glenoid cavity
• 35-4o years: irregular lipping around the clavicular facet and inferior surface of acromion process.
• 45 years: localized bony atrophy
• 5o years: Cristae scapulae



Lambdoid suture starts closing endocranially at 25-35 years and completes fusion by 45-5o years. Endocranial fusion occurs before ectocranial fusion.
The sagittal suture is used for age determination even though age estimation by skull sutures is   not considered to be very reliable. The last skull suture to fuse is the squamous temporal suture, which fuses after 8o years of age.

Q9,The dead body of a 2o-year-old man found in the sea was brought in for postmortem examination. which of the following findings would you see in seawater drowning?,"a)1 and 3
b)1 and 4
c)2, 3 and 5
d)2, 4 and 5","In cases of seawater drowning, hypernatremia and myocardial anoxia are seen. seawater
being hypertonic to plasma causes a shift of fluid from the blood to alveoli causing pulmonary  edema. There is a net decrease in blood volume causing hemoconcentration and a fall in blood pressure.
This hemoconcentration in seawater drowning causes increased viscosity of blood and myocardial anoxia leading to heart failure. Hyperkalemia is not seen in seawater drowning because RBcs get  shrunken in contrast to freshwater drowning.
Freshwater is hypotonic to plasma and is rapidly absorbed from the alveoli into the RBcs
resulting in hemodilution and hyponatremia. The RBcs finally swell up and lyse resulting in the release of intracellular potassium causing hyperkalemia. Increased intravascular blood volume    combined with hyperkalemia causes arrhythmia.

The study of ridge patterns in the skin is Dactylography/ Galton-Henry system/
Dermatoglyphics. Fingerprints are the impressions of patterns produced by the papillary or epidermal ridges present on the fingertips.
some changes in fingerprints include:
• Moderate epidermal ridge atrophy and loss of pattern in celiac disease
• Incomplete atrophy of the ridges in dermatitis
• Ridge alteration occurs in eczema, acanthosis nigricans, scleroderma, and dry or atrophic skin
• permanent impairment of the fingerprint pattern occurs in leprosy, electric injury, and after exposure to radiation



• Distance between the ridges is changed but the pattern is not altered in infantile paralysis, rickets, and acromegaly
classification of fingerprint ridges:
• Loops: radial or ulnar
• whorls: concentric, spiral, double spiral, or almond-shaped
• Arches: plain, tented, exceptional
• composite: They are a combination of 2 or more types
The fingerprint patterns are not inherited and cannot be used to prove paternity. The fingerprint pattern differs even between identical twins.

Q12,"A patient came to the casualty after a road traffic accident. A lacerated wound of 4x1 cm, which is bone-deep, is noted over the scalp of the forehead. which of the following is the correct mechanism of this lacerated wound?","a)shearing force
b)Impact of a semi sharp-edged object
c)overstretching of skin and subcutaneous tissue
d)Tissue crushed between weapon and underlying bone","The description of the wound given in the question suggests a split laceration and the mechanism is the tissue being crushed between the underlying bone (i.e. skull) and the weapon.
A laceration is a tear or a split in the skin, mucous membrane, muscle, or any internal organ produced by blunt force. The margins are irregular and may show minute tears and
bruising. Tears that are seen at the ends, diverging away from the main laceration are
called swallowtails. In skin lacerations, usually one of the margins overhangs the other. This helps in assessing the direction of the force.
classification of a laceration:
• split laceration (incised-like laceration): It occurs when the skin is crushed between two hard
objects. For example, during a fall, the scalp gets crushed between the skull from inside and hard ground outside. This results in a wound, which usually mimics an incised one unless examined
closely.
• Incised-looking lacerated wound is a wound with the linear splitting of the tissue caused by blunt force. It is seen where the skin overlies an area of the bone where there is scanty underlying
subcutaneous tissue such as the scalp, forehead, shin, etc.
• Avulsed laceration: A lesion where the skin separates or peels off by tearing from the underlying  tissues. An avulsion is a laceration produced by a shearing force delivered at an acute angle to tear off a portion of a traumatized surface or viscus from its attachments. It may overhang the wound.  It is also called flaying. This is common in road traffic accidents. (option A)
• Tears: Tearing of skin and subcutaneous tissue can occur from localized impact by or against irregular or semi-sharp objects. It may be due to blows by broken glass, or a fall on a rough
projected object. (option B)
• stretch laceration: It occurs due to the over-stretching of the skin, beyond its elasticity. This is  seen in wounds produced from running over by a motor vehicle, and when a fracture produces a sudden deformity of the bone. (option c)
• cut laceration: Injury by a heavy sharp-edged instrument. For example, cut from ax, chopper, etc

Q13,"The friend and victim had alcohol and got into an argument over a common girlfriend,
following which the friend kills the victim by sitting on his chest and covering his nose and mouth. This is an example of?","a)Burking
b)smothering
c)Traumatic asphyxia
d)overlaying","The given scenario is an example of burking.
Burking is a method of homicidal smothering and traumatic asphyxia where the assaulter kneels or sits on the chest (traumatic asphyxia) and close the nose and mouth with his hands
(smothering). This was the method of killing performed by william Burke and william Hare.
Image shows burking


other options:
option B: smothering is a form of asphyxia that is caused by closing the external respiratory
orifices either by the hand or by other means or blocking up the cavities of the nose and mouth by a foreign substance, such as mud, paper, cloth, etc.



Below image shows smothering


option C: Traumatic asphyxia results from respiratory arrest due to mechanical fixation of the
chest, by a heavy substance or object. The normal movements of the chest wall are prevented.
There is a gross compression ofthe chest and usually abdomen by a powerful force, due to which chest expansion and diaphragmatic lowering are prevented. For example stampede deaths,
crushing by falls of the earth in coal mines, or earthquakes.
option D: overlaying or compression suffocation results due to compression of the chest, so as to prevent breathing. It occurs when an intoxicated parent or other person shares a bed with an
infant. The thoracic movements are limited and respiratory exchange is either reduced or completely prevented which leads to death. It is always accidental.

Q14,"A person comes to the OPD with a burn injury to the right thigh. On examination, a soddened injury is seen along with erythema, blisters, and a line of demarcation that extends down the   limb. what is the most likely cause of the injury?","a)Electric burn
b)chemical burn
c)Dry heat
d)Moist heat","The soddened injury with erythema, blisters, and a line of demarcation that extends down the limb is highly suggestive of a scald injury caused by moist heat.
scald injury is an injury that results from the application of liquid above 6o°c or from steam i.e    moist heat. Redness appears immediately followed by blistering in a few minutes. Removal of the blistered skin leaves a raw, pink surface. Blisters are surrounded by a hyperaemic zone. scalds
appear soddened and bleached but the hair does not get singed. The skin does not get blackened or charred.
scald injuries are limited to the area of contact and are more severe at the initial point of contact. It can occur through clothing, which worsens damage due to a longer period of contact with the    hot liquid and a reduced cooling effect of evaporation.
It can be
• Immersion burns: Accidental or deliberate immersion in hot liquid, usually water.
• splash or spill burns: usually accidental.
• steam burns: Exposure to superheated steam.
clinical degree of scalding:
• Erythema (reddening)
• vesication (blister formation)
• Necrosis of dermis when deeper layers of skin are involved.
The image below shows a scald burn due to moist heat.


other options:
option A: Electric burns are injuries caused due to electric current, characterized by puckering of  the skin at the edges of the burns. It is surrounded by an area of pallor. There is no red line at the point of entry and exit. The characteristic marks seen at the entry point are called Joule burns, or electrical burns/marks. They are chalky white, shallow, centrally collapsed blisters with a raised



border.
The image below shows electric marks.



option B: Chemical burns by acid or alkalis appear as ulcerated patches without blisters. The hair is not singed and the red line of demarcation is absent. sometimes, the burn shows distinct
coloration and is usually uniform in character. strong acids produce dark leathery burns on the skin. strong alkalis cause the skin to slough and leave moist, slimy, greyish areas.
option C: Dry heat injuries are caused by a flame, via direct conduction or radiation to the
skin. These are characterized by singeing of the hair and blackening of the skin. vesication may or may not be present.",,D,2764-1675.PNG;2765-1676.PNG;2753-1664.PNG
Q15,which of the following rules are used in case as tests of insanity?,"a)1, 2, 3 and 4
b)2, 3, 4 only
c)1, 2 only
d)3, 4 only","Durham's rule and curren's rule are used in cases as tests for insanity.
Durhams's rule states that an accused person is not criminally responsible if, his unlawful act is the product of mental disease or mental defect.
curren’s rule states that an accused person is not criminally responsible if, at the time of
committing the act, he did not have the capacity to regulate his conduct to the requirements of the law as a result of mental disease or defect.
In India, the law of criminal responsibility is under section 84 I.P.c. It states that ""Nothing is an   offense which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or what he is doing is either wrong or contrary to the law”. This is slightly different from McNaughten's rule followed in Britain.
McNaughten's rule states that every man is to be presumed to be sane, and possesses a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes until the contrary is proved.
other rules to assess the criminal responsibility of insane persons:
• The Irresistible Impulse
• Federal rule or American Law Institute test (ALT)
• The Brawner rule.
Note: Ashley's rule is used to differentiate males and females based on the combined length of the manubrium and sternum. It is considered to be male sternum when the combined length is

Q16,"A person working in a dye factory presented with nausea, vomiting, dark bloody stools,
conjunctivitis, and a burning sensation in the throat and stomach. which poisoning do you suspect in this case?","a)Potassium permanganate
b)Arsenic
c)Thallium
d)Lead","The given clinical scenario of an industrial worker presenting with nausea, vomiting, dark bloody stools, conjunctivitis, burning in the throat and stomach is suggestive of acute arsenic poisoning.
There are 3 types of arsenic poisoning,
• Gastroenteric type is a common form and resembles bacterial food poisoning. There is a sweetish metallic taste. Features include:
• GIT: constriction in the throat and dysphagia, burning, and colicky pain in the esophagus,
stomach, and bowel occur. Intense thirst and severe vomiting are constant symptoms. Involuntary and frequent dark-colored, stinking, and bloody stools that later become colorless, odorless, and    watery resembling rice-water stools of cholera. A garlicky odor of breath and feces may be noted
• Renal: oliguria, uremia, albuminuria, red cell casts.
• cardiovascular system: Acute circulatory collapse with vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, ventricular tachycardia, and fibrillation.
• central nervous system: Headache, vertigo, hyperthermia, convulsions, coma. Peripheral neuropathy is more sensory than motor.
• Death is usually due to circulatory failure.
• Fulminant type: Massive doses of arsenic when rapidly absorbed cause death in one to three
hours. Death occurs due to shock and peripheral vascular failure. Arsenic also has a direct action



on the heart muscle. In this type gastrointestinal symptoms are absent.
• Narcotic type: The gastrointestinal symptoms are minimal. There is giddiness, formication, delirium. Arseniuretted hydrogen when inhaled as a gas, destroys hemoglobin and causes
hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, and renal failure. Death is instantaneous.
Treatment:
• Repeated stomach washes with warm water and milk.
• Emetics should not be used
• oral hydrated ferric oxide is given in small doses. It converts toxic arsenic to non-toxic ferric arsenite
• Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is preferred, if not available British anti-Lewisite (BAL) is used.
other options:
option A: potassium permanganate causes burning pain from the mouth to the stomach, intense thirst, dysphagia, stridor, and a persistent cough. The oral cavity is discolored, inflamed, and
superficially corroded. Soon after poisoning the color is purple-brown, but later it appears coal-black.
option C: Thallium poisoning is characterized by a triad of symptoms of acute gastrointestinal upset, painful combined polyneuropathy, and hair loss after poisoning. other symptoms
include muscle and joint pain, convulsions, optic neuritis, delirium. Loss of the outer third of eyebrows is significant. Maculo-papular butterfly-shaped skin eruption on the face is
characteristic. There may be Mees lines on the nails.
option D: Acute Lead poisoning causes dry throat, burning abdominal pain, peripheral circulatory collapse, insomnia, paraesthesias, depression, coma, and death. Cerebellar ataxia is common in
children with acute lead poisoning. A screening test for lead poisoning is the presence of
porphyrinuria, mainly due to coproporphyrin III. peripheral smear shows basophilic stippling. A Burtonian line may be visible on the gums.",,B,

b)Blast of air
c)Explosion burns
d)Building collapse","The given history of multiple small puncture wounds to the right side of the chest, below the nipple, and multiple small abrasions and bruising over the left lower abdomen are highly
suggestive of blast injuries sustained due to flying missiles.
Blast injury is a complex type of physical trauma resulting from direct or indirect exposure to an explosion causing a sudden increase or decrease in atmospheric pressure.
T.K.Marshall’s (Marshall's triad) described the characteristic injuries associated with bomb explosions. It includes:
• Abrasions
• Bruises/contusions
• puncture lacerations
Blast injuries are classified as:



primary injuries: Effect of transmitted blast waves on gas-containing structures. The external injuries are absent and are characterized by internal injuries. The middle, ear, lungs, and
gastrointestinal tract are the most susceptible to this.
secondary injuries: Injuries caused by shrapnel and other airborne debris propelled by the    explosion. These injuries may affect any part of the body and sometimes result in penetrating trauma. Most casualties are caused by secondary injuries.
Tertiary injuries: These are caused by blast wind that can throw victims against solid objects.
Quaternary injuries: All other injuries caused by explosions are not included in the above three categories. eg, flash burns, crush injuries, respiratory effects due to toxic dust, gas, etc.
option B: Blast of air or blast wave cause primary injuries which involve internal organs without external injury.
option c: Explosion burns: when the bomb explodes, the temperature of the explosive gases can exceed 2ooo°c, and the heat radiated momentarily can cause flash burns. It is a quaternary type of blast injury.
option D: Building collapse can cause crush injuries which is a quaternary blast injury.",,A,
Q18,"on conducting the autopsy on a victim of hanging, the ligature mark is seen at the lower 1/3rd of the neck. The victim is seen to have a protruded tongue. He was found with his head
hanging to his left side with saliva dribbling from the left angle of his mouth. Both the pupils are dilated and the right eye is open. compression of which of the following structures is the  probable reason for an open right eye in this case?","a)Right internal jugular vein
b)cervical sympathetic chain
c)Left vagus nerve
d)Right internal carotid artery","compression of the cervical sympathetic chain is the probable reason for an open right eye in this case.
Dilated pupils are seen when the ligature knot presses on the cervical sympathetic chain, the eye on the same side may remain open and its pupil dilated termed as le facie sympathique. It
indicates antemortem hanging.
Dribbling of saliva is the surest sign of antemortem hanging. This occurs due to the increased salivation before death due to the stimulation of the salivary glands by the ligature or by
congestive hypoxia. stimulation of pterygopalatine ganglion also causes increased salivation.
Dribbling of saliva occurs from the angle of the mouth opposite to the side of the knot. when the knot is on the nape of the neck, it occurs across the middle of the lower lip.
The ligature mark is usually above the hyoid bone. It runs obliquely, backward, upwards, is non - continuous, and towards the point of suspension. The mark is noncontinuous because of a gap at the nape of the neck. when the knot is in an inverted v shape when it is in contact with the skin,
because the ligature material extends downward on both sides. The skin is usually
depressed/grooved, yellowish-brown, dry, hard, with small abrasions called rope burns at its edges.
protrusion of tongue results from the pressure on floor of the mouth by ligature. It is usually swollen and blue. Injuries include bite marks with or without underlying small hemorrhages  ( marginal  hemorrhages).
Tardieu s spots may be present on the forehead, over the eyelids, under the conjunctiva, and near the temple.
other options:



option A- In partial hanging, internal jugular veins are compressed, but vertebral arteries
continue to supply blood to the head, resulting in congestion of the face and petechiae. when
suspension is complete, face is pale and petechial haemorrhages are relatively uncommon due to the complete obstruction of the arterial system.
option C- vagus nerve compression leads to a sudden halt of the progression of the pure
asphyxial process due to the superimposition of vagal inhibition. In these cases, the face remains pale.
option D- Right internal carotid artery compression can cause transverse tears of carotid artery   intima, known as the Amussat's sign. It is seen with antemortem hanging. These are usually seen in obese victims and in posteriorly placed knots.",,B,2769-1677.PNG
