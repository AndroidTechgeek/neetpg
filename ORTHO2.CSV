Q1,The X-ray image of a patient that presented to the casualty is given below. How will you manage this case?,"a)Nailing
b)plating
c)Tension band wiring
d)knee splint","The given radiograph shows a transverse fracture of the patella which should be managed by tension band wiring.



patellar fractures can be undisplaced, transverse, comminuted, or longitudinal. The radiological    examination includes Ap and lateral views. A skyline view of the patella is required in some cases of undisplaced fractures.
Management of patellar fractures:
• undisplaced fractures: Treated with a cylinder cast extending from the groin to just above the malleoli, with the knee in full extension, left for at least 3 weeks.
• Transverse fractures: surgical reduction using tension-band wiring and K-wire fixation, followed by extensor retinaculum repair and physiotherapy.
• comminuted fractures: open reduction and fixation with patellectomy. patella-saving operations are also being performed with improved fixation techniques.
• Longitudinal fractures: As the extensor apparatus is usually intact, they can be treated with a cylinder cast or extension brace initially, followed by range-of-motion exercises.",5240-3290.PNG,C,
Q2,A 55-year-old female patient presented with a flexion contracture of the hip. which of the following tests is useful in diagnosis?,"a)Allen's test
b)Trendelenburg test
c)Thomas test
d)ober test","Thomas test is useful in diagnosing flexion contracture of the hip.
Flexion deformity is a common hip deformity, often caused by stronger flexor muscles
overpowering the extensor muscles. when there is a spasm of the muscles, the stronger flexors pull the hip in flexion. soft tissue contractures can convert this into a fixed flexion deformity,    making locomotion impossible.
The Thomas test is used to evaluate the degree of flexion deformity. The aim is to eliminate compensatory lumbar lordosis and reveal the obvious flexion deformity for measurement.
During the test, the patient lies supine on a hard surface with legs straight. The patient may
compensate for the flexion deformity by arching the lower back, creating excessive lumbar
lordosis. The easy passage of the examiner's hand between the bed and the back of the patient is considered a positive test as normally this is not possible.
By gradually flexing the unaffected hip, the pelvis tilts and eliminates lumbar lordosis, causing the affected hip to assume the flexed position. The angle between the affected thigh and the bed
indicates the degree of flexion deformity.





other options:
option A: Allen's Test is mainly used to test the adequacy of ulnar collateral blood flow to the hand, which is usually done prior to radial artery cannulation.


option B: Trendelenberg test is used to assess the weakness or paralysis of the gluteus medius muscle.





option D: ober's test is used in physical examination to identify the tightness of the iliotibial band.",,C,5247-3297.PNG;5247-3296.PNG;5248-3299.PNG
Q3,A 1o-year-old came to the OPD with the following deformity of his left upper limb. what is the most likely cause of the fracture?,"a)supracondylar Fracture
b)Olecranon Fracture
c)Radial Head fracture
d)Triad of elbow","The given image shows cubitus varus deformity, where the forearm has deviated medially in
relation to the upper arm, which is a common complication of supracondylar humeral fracture.
Malunion is the commonest complication of a supracondylar fracture and results in a cubitus
varus deformity, also known as gunstock deformity. This occurs when the fracture unites with the distal fragment tilted medially and in internal rotation.
The image below shows gunstock deformity:




cubitus varus is primarily a cosmetic concern with minimal functional impairment. Mild cases may not necessitate treatment, while severe deformities should be corrected through a lateral   closed wedge osteotomy (French osteotomy).
other options:
option B: olecranon fracture results from a direct injury as in a fall onto the point of the elbow. complications include non-union, elbow stiffness, and osteoarthritis
option c: Radial head fracture results from a fall on an outstretched hand and presents with pain over the lateral aspect of the forearm near the elbow along with restricted elbow movements,
pronation, and supination. complications include posterior interosseous nerve injury, myositis ossificans, and osteoarthritis.
option D: Terrible triad of elbow refers to elbow dislocation with fracture of the radial head, coronoid process, and medial collateral ligament rupture.",5241-3292.PNG,A,5248-3298.PNG
Q4,A 4-year-old child was brought to the OPD with a painless deformity. A radiograph of the child's legs is shown below. The most common cause of this deformity is ______.,"a)skeletal dysplasia
b)Rickets
c)scurvy
d)Blount disease","The given X-ray shows bow legs or genu varum which is most commonly seen in rickets.
Rickets is a bone mineralization disorder that primarily affects children with open growth plates, resulting from a deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate.
In toddlers, genu varum is one of the most common initial sign of rickets. In older children, genu valgum or coxa vara might be present.",5241-3291.PNG,B,5249-3300.PNG
Q5,"A 25 year old man involved in a fight, injured his finger and the deformity is shown in the following image. X-ray is normal. The most appropriate management at this stage is:","a)splint the finger in flexion
b)Buddy strapping
c)surgical repair of the flexor tendon
d)splint the finger in hyperextension","Based on the mechanism of injury and the deformity characterized by flexion at the distal
interphalangeal joint, along with a normal radiograph, the likely diagnosis is mallet finger, which is managed by splinting the finger in hyperextension.



Mallet finger, also known as baseball finger, occurs when there is a sudden passive flexion of the   distal interphalangeal joint, causing avulsion of the extensor tendon from its insertion at the base of the distal phalanx.



surgery is considered only if there is a large fragment (&gt;5o%) and subluxation of the DIp joint.",5242-3293.PNG,D,5250-3302.PNG;5250-3301.PNG
Q6,what is your diagnosis from the below X-ray images?,"a)solitary bone cyst
b)Aneurysmal bone cyst
c)Giant cell tumor
d)osteoblastoma","The given radiographs show the anteroposterior and lateral views of the wrist, demonstrating a   solitary lytic lesion with cortical expansion and a soap-bubble appearance in the epiphysis of the distal radius, suggestive of a giant cell tumor (GCT).
GCT usually affects young adults aged 2o to 4o years, with slight female predominance. It is a  benign but locally aggressive tumor. It is exclusively seen in adults and affects the ends of long



bones, typically involving the epiphysis. The most common location of the tumor is the distal
femur followed by the proximal tibia. Involvement of the distal end of the radius is also seen and the tumor is more aggressive in this location.
Important X-ray features of a GCT:
• A solitary, possibly loculated, lytic lesion in the epiphysis
• Eccentric location, most often sub-chondral
• Expansion of the overlying cortex
• soap bubble appearance (the tumor is homogenously lytic with trabeculae of the remnants of bone traversing it, giving it a loculated appearance).
• No calcification within the tumor
• No or minimal reactive sclerosis around the tumor
• Thinned out cortex, may be perforated
The classical ""soap bubble"" appearance of a giant cell tumor (GCT) is shown below:


other options:
option A: A solitary bone cyst is most commonly occurs in the metaphysis ofthe bone. on an X-ray, a bone fracture fragment may be observed resting in a dependent portion of the cyst,
referred to as the fallen fragment or fallen leaf sign. This sign is considered pathognomonic of a simple bone cyst.
The image below shows a bone cyst in the humerus along with a pathological fracture and fallen leaf sign:





option B: on an X-ray, an aneurysmal bone cyst is seen as an eccentric, expansile, lytic lesion with well-defined margins in the metaphysis.


option D: osteoblastoma is a benign bone tumor usually occurring in the jaw and spine. on
X-ray, a radiopaque central nidus with a surrounding radiolucent halo is seen. If occurring in the long bones, it involves the diaphysis or metaphysis, but never in the epiphysis.
The image below shows an osteoblastoma in C7 vertebrae:",5243-3294.PNG,C,5251-3303.PNG;5252-3305.PNG;5252-3304.PNG;5253-3306.PNG
Q7,which of the following is true regarding the scar tissue in patellar clunk syndrome?,"a)superior pole of patella, impinging during flexion
b)superior pole of patella, impinging during extension
c)Inferior pole of patella, impinging during flexion
d)Inferior pole of patella, impinging during extension","In patellar clunk syndrome, the scar tissue which is formed at the superior pole of the patella becomes impinged during knee extension.
patellar clunk syndrome is seen after posterior-stabilized knee arthroplasty. A fibrous nodule
forms on the posterior surface of the quadriceps tendon just above the superior pole of the patella. This can become entrapped in the intercondylar notch of the femoral prosthesis and cause the
knee to ""clunk"" at 3o- 45 degrees to the femoral axis while the patient actively extends the knee.
The recommended treatment is arthroscopic debridement of the nodule.",,B,
Q8,The earliest symptom of acute compartment syndrome is _____________,"a)pain
b)pallor
c)paresthesia
d)paralysis","The earliest symptom of acute compartment syndrome is pain.
Acute compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency caused by increased pressure within a
fascial compartment, leading to tissue ischemia. It is characterized by rapid progression of pain and swelling in an extremity, commonly precipitated by traumatic injury.
The classic features of ischemia in acute compartment syndrome include the 5 p's:
• pain - It is the first symptom of acute compartment syndrome. Ischemic muscle is highly sensitive to touch. on passive stretching of the muscles, severe pain can be elicited.
• paresthesia - It is the first sign of nerve ischemia.
• pallor - It may not be seen always. The skin outside the compartment may be normally perfused, as only the intra-compartmental perfusion may be affected.
• paralysis - paralysis of muscle groups affected in that compartment is a late sign.



• pulselessness - usually, the peripheral pulses and capillary return are intact in the early stages, unless there is a major arterial injury. If pulses are absent, arteriography is indicated.
The diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring the intra-compartmental pressure using a split
catheter introduced into the compartment. The difference between diastolic pressure and
compartment pressure is known as differential pressure (Δp). A differential pressure (Δp) of less    than 3o mm Hg (4.oo kilopascals) is an indication for immediate compartment decompression by performing a fasciotomy.",,A,
Q9,Identify the following marked structures.,"a)1 - sequestrum, 2 - Involucrum, 3 - cloacae
b)1 - sequestrum, 2 - cloacae, 3 - Involucrum
c)1 - Involucrum, 2 - cloacae, 3 - sequestrum
d)1- cloacae, 2 - sequestrum, 3 - Involucrum","In the given radiographs showing features of chronic osteomyelitis, the marked structures are as follows:
• Involucrum is the thick sheath of periosteal new bone that surrounds the sequestrum.
• cloacae are openings in the involucrum that allow drainage of purulent and necrotic material out of the dead bone.
• sequestrum is a piece of devitalized bone that has been separated from its surrounding bone during the process of necrosis.",5244-3295.PNG,C,5254-3307.PNG
Q10,which tumor does not cause osteomalacia and phosphaturia?,"a)osteosarcoma
b)Hemangiopericytoma
c)Fibrosarcoma
d)Breast carcinoma","Breast carcinoma does not cause osteomalacia and phosphaturia.
Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome which presents with
hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia and renal phosphate wasting. It is most commonly seen with mesenchymal tumors.
Tumors associated with osteomalacia are:



• Hemangiopericytoma (option B)
• Non-ossifying fibroma
• osteosarcoma (option A)
• osteoblastoma
• Fibrosarcoma (option C)",,D,
Q11,"A polytrauma patient with femur fracture and massive hemorrhage presents to the emergency department after a road traffic accident. which of the following is not an immediate
treatment consideration in this patient?","a)Administration of IV crystalloids
b)Administration oftranexamic acid
c)check coagulation with thromboelastography
d)Internal fixation of femur fracture","The internal fixation of a femur fracture is not an immediate concern in a patient with polytrauma and hemodynamic instability secondary to severe blood loss. Instead, splinting is preferred until    the patient has been stabilized.
Damage Control orthopaedics (DCo) in unstable/borderline polytrauma patients involves 3 components:
• stage 1: Resuscitative procedures for rapid hemorrhage control
• stage 2: Restoration of normal physiologic parameters
• stage 3: Definitive surgical management
The first stage is early temporary stabilization of unstable fractures and the control of the
bleeding. In femur fracture, the most suited approach is temporary stabilization using an external fixator.
The second stage involves resuscitation and stabilization of the patients in the ICU.
Finally, the third stage involves delayed definitive fracture management after the patient’s
condition becomes suitable. In femur fracture, the definitive procedure is intramedullary nailing which is performed after the patient becomes stable.",,D,
Q12,what is the most common form of arthritis?,"a)Rheumatoid arthritis
b)psoriatic arthritis
c)seronegative arthritis
d)osteoarthritis","osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis.
osteoarthritis is strongly associated with age and is highly prevalent among older individuals.
studies suggest that over 8o% of people aged 55 and above have osteoarthritis in at least one joint.",,D,
