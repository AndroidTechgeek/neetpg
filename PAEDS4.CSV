Q1,which of the following is least likely regarding Rh incompatibility in a newborn?,"a)Increased unconjugated bilirubin
b)Increased fecal urobilinogen
c)Increased urine bilirubin
d)Increased stercobilinogen","Amongst the given options, increased urine bilirubin is least likely with Rh incompatibility in newborns.
Rh incompatibility leads to hemolysis in the newborn, causing the release of large amounts of hemoglobin. This hemoglobin is converted to biliverdin and then to unconjugated bilirubin.
The newborn liver has a limited capacity to convert this large amount of unconjugated bilirubin to its soluble form through glucuronide conjugation. As a result, levels of unconjugated bilirubin
increase (option A). unconjugated bilirubin, being water-insoluble and bound to albumin, is not excreted in urine.
Intestinal bacteria convert unconjugated bilirubin to urobilinogen and stercobilinogen, which are excreted in urine and stool (options B and D).",,C,
Q2,"A 3-year-old toxic child presents with tachypnea, high-grade fever, inspiratory stridor, and developed difficulty in swallowing with drooling of saliva within 4-6 hours of fever. Along   with airway management which of the following needs to be given?","a)Nebulisation with racemic adrenaline
b)Iv ceftriaxone
c)Diphtheria antitoxin
d)start steroids","The clinical presentation of a toxic-looking child with high-grade fever, tachypnea, inspiratory   stridor, dysphagia, and salivary drooling strongly suggests acute epiglottitis. once the airway is secured, empirical antimicrobial therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone is recommended in the    management of acute epiglottitis.
The most common causative agents of epiglottitis in vaccinated children are streptococcus
pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus. The incidence of Haemophilus influenzae type B has decreased significantly due to
vaccination.



The child presents with a high fever, sore throat, dyspnea, dysphagia, and progressive respiratory obstruction. The child may exhibit a toxic appearance, with salivary drooling and assuming a
tripod position. The presence of stridor indicates near-complete obstruction of the airway.
Laryngoscopy should be promptly conducted in a controlled setting, such as an operating room or intensive care unit when the diagnosis of epiglottitis is certain or likely based on clinical
evaluation.
Acute epiglottitis is a medical emergency due to unpredictable clinical course and sudden airway obstruction. Immediate airway management through endotracheal or nasotracheal intubation or tracheostomy is crucial, regardless of the severity of respiratory distress. Empiric treatment with antibiotics like ceftriaxone, cefepime, or meropenem is recommended until culture and
susceptibility results are available. Dexamethasone may also be administered to reduce pharyngeal edema.
other options:
option A: Nebulisation with racemic adrenaline is given in moderate to severe croup.

Q3,A child transfers an object from one hand to another. what does it signify?,"a)visual motor co-ordination
b)Ability to compare objects
c)Ability to handle small objects
d)voluntary release","The milestone of transfer of objects from one hand to another in a child signifies the ability of the child to compare objects. The transfer of objects is a motor milestone occurring at 6 months of
age.
other options:
option A: when the child reaches for objects it implies the onset of visuomotor coordination. It is attained at 4 months
option C: Thumb finger grasp implies the ability to handle small objects. It is attained at 8 months.



option D: The voluntary release/ Release phenomenon is used to denote the disappearance of the palmar grasp, which is seen at 4 months.",,B,
Q4,surgical correction of vsD is performed in an infant. This will help in relieving which of the following features?,"a)Respiratory alkalosis
b)Failure to thrive
c)Arrythmia
d)Heart block","Surgery for ventricular septal defect (VSD) mainly helps to relieve congestive cardiac failure which manifests as a failure to thrive in an infant. The main aim of performing surgery in VSD is to get    the symptoms of heart failure in control and to prevent the development of pulmonary vascular
disease.
Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common congenital heart disease. The most common subtype is the membranous type.
Small VSDs with trivial left-to-right shunts and normal pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) are the  most common. These patients are asymptomatic. A loud, harsh, or blowing holosystolic murmur is present and heard best over the lower left sternal border, and it is accompanied by a thrill.
Small VSDs close spontaneously, especially within the first two years of life. Muscular VSDs have a higher closure rate (up to 8o%) compared to membranous VSDs.
Large VSDs with excessive pulmonary blood flow and pulmonary hypertension can lead to signs of congestive heart failure in early infancy. These signs may include dyspnea, feeding difficulties,
poor weight gain, profuse perspiration, irritability, weak crying, and recurrent pulmonary
infections. The holosystolic murmur associated with a large VSD is less harsh and more blowing compared to that of a small VSD. This is due to the absence of a significant pressure gradient
across the defect.
The indications of surgery in VSD are:
• Large defects in patients of any age with uncontrolled symptoms or failure to thrive.
• Moderate to large defects associated with pulmonary hypertension in infants between 6 and 12 months, even if symptoms are controlled by medication.
• Patients older than 24 months with a Qp: Qs ratio greater than 2:1 (ratio of total pulmonary blood flow-Qp to total systemic blood flow-Qs).
• Supracristal VSDs of any size, due to the higher risk of developing aortic valve regurgitation.
Severe pulmonary vascular disease nonresponsive to pulmonary vasodilators is a contraindication to VSD closure.
other options:
options A and C: Respiratory alkalosis and arrhythmia are other rare complications of VSD.
options D: Heart block may occur perioperatively in VSD.",,B,
Q5,All the following PFT findings in a child are suggestive of asthma except?,"a)Increase in FEV1&gt; 12% after salbutamol inhalation
b)FEV1/FVC&lt; 8O%
c)Day- night variation of FEV1 &gt; 15%
d)Decrease in FEV1&gt;15% after exercise","Day-night variation of FEV1 &gt; 15% is not suggestive of asthma, variation ≥2o% is suggestive of asthma.



Lung Function Abnormalities in childhood Asthma
• spirometry showing airflow limitation: Low FEV1 (relative to the percentage of predicted norms) and FEV1:FVc ratio &lt;o.8o (option B)
• Bronchodilator response (to inhaled β-agonist): Improvement in FEV1 ≥12% and ≥2oo mL after inhalation of a short-acting beta agonist (option A).
• Exercise challenge: worsening in FEV1 ≥15% (option D)
• Daily peak expiratory flow (PEF) or FEV1 monitoring: day to day and/or A.M.-to-P.M. variation
≥2o%
• Exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO): A value of &gt;2oppb (parts per billion) supports the clinical diagnosis of asthma in children.
FEV1: Forced expiratory volume in 1 sec; FVc: Forced vital capacity.
childhood asthma can be classified into two types: recurrent wheezing in early childhood, often triggered by respiratory viral infections and resolves during preschool/lower school years, and    chronic asthma associated with allergies that persist into later childhood and adulthood.
Based on the severity, acute asthma is classified as mild, moderate, and severe.

Q8,Phototherapy converts bilirubin to _________,"a)stercobilin
b)Lumirubin
c)Biliverdin
d)urobilin","phototherapy converts bilirubin to lumirubin. It is used to manage clinical jaundice and indirect hyperbilirubinemia.
It involves exposing the patient to high-intensity light in the visible spectrum. Bilirubin absorbs light most effectively in the blue range (42o to 47onm).
phototherapy converts toxic bilirubin into two forms: lumirubin, formed by irreversible structural isomerization that can be excreted by the kidneys, and a reversible isomer (4z,15E-bilirubin),
formed by photoisomerization that can be excreted in bile without conjugation.



The effectiveness of phototherapy depends on factors such as the appropriate wavelength range, distance to the infant, skin surface area exposure, and the infant's bilirubin metabolism. The
infant's eyes should be covered to prevent corneal damage. continuous conventional phototherapy is typically used, with frequent repositioning of the infant.
phototherapy can be discontinued once two TSB (total serum bilirubin) values 12 hours apart fall below current age-specific cut-offs.
complications of phototherapy may include loose stools, erythematous macular rash, purpuric  rash (linked to transient porphyrinemia), overheating, dehydration (due to increased insensible water loss and diarrhea), and hypothermia from exposure.
Bronze baby syndrome is a dark grayish-brown skin discoloration seen in infants undergoing   phototherapy in the presence of direct hyperbilirubinemia. porphyria is a contraindication for phototherapy because photosensitivity and blistering can be severe in these infants.",,B,
Q9,Identify the vitamin which when deficient can lead to neonatal seizures.,"a)pyridoxine
b)Thiamine
c)Riboflavin
d)pantothenic acid","pyridoxine deficiency can cause refractory seizures in the neonatal period and infancy.
pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (p5p) is the active form of pyridoxine and functions as a cofactor for
enzymes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, amino acid metabolism, and glycogen
metabolism. Intracellular p5p deficiency in the brain can lead to a seizure disorder that does not respond to typical anticonvulsant medications but shows a response to pyridoxine.
Antiquitin deficiency is the most common cause of pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (due to mutations in the ALDH7A1 alleles)
They primarily present with generalized seizures in the early days of life. The seizures can be of various types, recurrent focal motor seizures, generalized tonic seizures, and
myoclonus. Additional manifestations may include dystonia, respiratory distress, abdominal distention with vomiting, hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, and hypothermia.
Increased α-aminoadipic semialdehyde and pipecolic acid levels are observed in the cSF, plasma, and urine. Treatment with vitamin B6 (5o-1oo mg/day) shows significant improvement in
seizures. Life-long therapy is needed.
other options:
option B: Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency causes beriberi.
option c: Riboflavin (vitamin B2) deficiency causes glossitis, cheilosis, keratitis, and corneal vascularization.
option D: pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) deficiency causes burning feet syndrome.",,A,
Q10,"A baby assessed 5 minutes after birth is found to be pink, with blue extremities, and irregular respiration. Heart rate is 8o beats per minute. There is grimace and some flexion. what is the Apgar score for this baby?","a)2
b)3
c)4
d)5","The Apgar score for this baby will be 5.
• color; body pink, extremities blue: score-1



• Heart rate; 8o beats per minute: score 1
• Grimace: score-1
• some flexion: score-1
• Irregular respiration: score-1
The Apgar score is a systematic way of assessing the infant after birth at 1 and 5 minutes of life. It  gives a maximum score of 1o which indicates the newborn is in the best possible condition. scores between o-3 require immediate resuscitation.
changes in the Apgar scores denote the response of the infant to resuscitation. If the score at 5    minutes remains less than 7, the infant should be assessed again every 5 minutes for the next 2o minutes.


causes for false positive Apgar score are:
• prematurity
• Drugs like analgesics, narcotics, sedatives, magnesium sulfate
• Acute cerebral trauma
• precipitous delivery
• Airway obstruction (choanal atresia)
• congenital pneumonia or sepsis
• Hemorrhage- hypovolemia
False-negative Apgar score is seen in maternal acidosis and high fetal catecholamine levels.",,D,5563-3547.PNG
Q11,A child suffering from steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome is brought to the OpD for vaccination. which of the following is true about vaccination in this child?,"a)All live vaccines under NIS can be given as per schedule
b)All killed vaccines under NIS can be given
c)Only pneumococcal vaccine should be given to the child in acute phase
d)Live vaccines are contraindicated in the child’s sibling","In a child with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome, all killed vaccines can be given.



option A: Live virus vaccines are administered with caution in children receiving corticosteroid therapy. They can be given to patients in whom the prednisone dose is below 1mg/kg daily or     2mg/kg on alternate days. If the patient is receiving corticosteroid-sparing agents
(cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine), live virus vaccines are contraindicated.
option C: only live vaccines are contraindicated in this child. Full pneumococcal vaccination (with the 13-valent conjugate vaccine and 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine) and influenza vaccination     can be given annually to the child and their household contacts.
option D: Immunization of siblings/healthy household contacts with live vaccines is necessary to reduce the risk of infection transmission to the immunosuppressed child. Direct exposure to the  gastrointestinal/respiratory secretions of the household contacts is avoided for about 3-6 weeks    after vaccination.
Minimal change nephrotic syndrome is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome. It
is characterized by heavy proteinuria, edema, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia. The
diagnosis is confirmed by performing a urinalysis and urine protein: creatinine ratio. Nephrotic range proteinuria is proteinuria greater than 3.5 g per 24 hours (3+ or 4+) or a urine protein :
creatinine ratio exceeding 2.
The recommended initial treatment for nephrotic syndrome is a daily dose of 2mg/kg (max 6omg) of prednisolone for 6 weeks followed by an alternate dose of 1.5mg/kg (max 4omg) for the next 6-8 weeks.
Definitions regarding the course of nephrotic syndrome:
• Frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome: ≥2 relapses in 6 months or 3 or more relapses in 12 months.
• steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome: Relapse during steroid tapering or within 2 weeks of discontinuation.
• steroid resistance: Failure to achieve remission despite therapy with daily prednisolone for 6 weeks
Alternative drugs used in steroid-dependent patients, frequent relapsers, steroid-resistant
patients, and those with severe corticosteroid toxicity are cyclophosphamide, calcineurin
inhibitors: cyclosporine and Tacrolimus, mycophenolate, levamisole, and rituximab (a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD2o).",,B,
Q12,"A young girl presents with the complaints of continuous dribbling of urine. However, she also voids normally. Her parents tell you that she had never been totally dry since her birth. what



is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Ectopic ureter
b)ureterocele
c)congenital megaureter
d)vesicoureteric reflux","The clinical presentation of a young girl with continuous dribbling of urine, despite normal voiding, strongly suggests the diagnosis of an ectopic ureter.
An ectopic ureter refers to a condition where the ureter drains outside the bladder. It is more common in females and opens either into the urethra below the sphincter or into the vagina.
Hence, they present with constant urinary dripping all day, even though the child voids regularly (paradoxical incontinence).
The terminal part of the ureter is frequently narrowed, leading to hydroureteronephrosis. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common due to urinary stasis.



In males, ectopic ureters usually enter the posterior urethra above the external sphincter, hence they are usually continent and most patients present with UTI or epididymitis.
Investigations include renal ultrasound (USG), voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), and renal scan to assess function. USG shows a hydronephrotic kidney or dilated upper pole and ureter. If there  is a satisfactory function, the recommended treatment options are ureteral reimplantation into
the bladder or ureteroureterostomy. The poor function may require partial or total nephrectomy.
other options:
option B: A ureterocele is a cystic dilation of the terminal ureter, typically obstructive due to a
small ureteral opening. In childhood, they commonly present with infections. Larger ureteroceles can cause obstruction at the bladder neck.
option C: Congenital megaureter (dilated ureter) presents UTI, urinary stones, hematuria, and flank pain because of urinary stasis.
option D: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is characterized by the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder to the ureter and kidney. They usually present with recurrent attacks of UTI.",,A,
Q13,A 14-month-old child with Hb 6.3 was undergoing repeated blood transfusions. The last    transfusion was given in the 9th month. which of the following investigation is used for a definitive diagnosis?,"a)High performance liquid chromatography
b)Ferritin levels estimation
c)Bone marrow aspiration
d)Globin gene sequencing","The given clinical scenario of repeated transfusion, low hemoglobin level, and target cells in the smear are suggestive of thalassemia. Globin gene sequencing is used for its definitive diagnosis.
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used as a screening test for thalassemia (option A).
Thalassemia is a hemoglobinopathy that arises due to deficient synthesis of the globin chains.
Depending on the chain affected, it is classified into α-thalassemia and β-thalassemia.
β-thalassemia is caused by point mutations of the β-thalassemia gene on chromosome 11, which   diminish the synthesis of β-globin chains. Splicing mutations are the most common cause of (β+) thalassemia.
There is a deficit in the synthesis of HbA with an elevation of HbA2 and HbF levels in
β-thalassemia. Children with severe thalassemia present with distinctive facial features such as maxilla hyperplasia, a flat nasal bridge, and frontal bossing. other manifestations include
pathologic bone fractures, significant hepatosplenomegaly, and cachexia.
Blood smears show marked anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, and microcytic hypochromic anemia.
Target cells, basophilic stippling, and fragmented red cells also are common. A radiographic image of the skull shows the classic 'crew cut' appearance.
Hb Electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are used as screening tests for thalassemia. DNA diagnosis to detect β-thalassemia mutations is used for definitive
diagnosis. The Mentzer index is the ratio of MCV to RBC count. It is used to differentiate between iron-deficiency anemia and β-thalassemia trait. The Mentzer index is &lt;13 in thalassemia minor   syndrome.
Transfusions are administered every 3-4 weeks to maintain a pretransfusion hemoglobin level of
9.5-1o.5 g/dL. Transfusion-induced hemosiderosis is a significant complication in
transfusion-dependent thalassemia. Iron deposition occurs in the liver, endocrine organs, and



heart, resulting in complications including hypothyroidism, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, growth hormone deficiency, hypoparathyroidism, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and
arrhythmias.
