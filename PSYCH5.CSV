• Decline in the level of consciousness.
• Fluctuating course - unpredictable fluctuations in severity and other clinical manifestations
• Sundowning - worsening of symptoms at night

"Q7","seman's squeeze technique is used for which of the following conditions?","a)Retrograde ejaculation
b)Erectile dysfunction
c)premature ejaculation
d)painful ejaculation","seman's squeeze technique is used for premature ejaculation, to prolong the time period until ejaculation.
seman's technique (stop-start technique): It is a variation of the squeeze technique where a man approaches the point close to ejaculation and then stops before ejaculation and relaxes before
starting stimulation again. This method prolongs the time until ejaculation by relying on behavior modification.
other treatments for premature ejaculation:
• squeeze technique (Master and Johnson's technique)- as a man approaches a climax, he
squeezes the tip of the penis just below the head of the penis. The pressure is held there until the sensation of impending orgasm diminishes. The process can then be started over again so that
over time a man prolongs the time period until he reaches ejaculation.
• sensate focusing- refocussing on the non-coital aspects of sexual activity.
• selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssRIs)- delays ejaculation. e.g.- dapoxetine, paroxetine.","","C",""
"Q8","Addison's disease can present with symptoms similar to which of the following disorders?","a)Depression
b)Generalised anxiety disorder
c)Bipolar disorder
d)panic disorder","Addison's disease presents most similarly to depression. Apathy, social withdrawal, impaired sleep, decreased concentration, and prominent fatigue is frequently seen which is usually
mistaken for depression.
Following infection, trauma, or surgery, a patient with previously unrecognized Addison's disease may suffer from an Addisonian crisis. such patients present with either shock or hypoglycemia.    This is a medical emergency requiring urgent medical referral.

Addison's disease	Depression
Hyperthyroidism	Mood disorder, panic disorde r, generalized anxiety disorde r
Hypothyroidism	Depression,hypomania, delus ions, schizophrenia (myxede   ma madness).

"Q10","which of the following is not true about Alzheimer's disease?","a)Intracellular neurofibrillary tangles are seen
b)Neuritic plaques made of beta amyloid are found
c)Nucleus of Meynert is not affected
d)short term memory is affected","Nucleus of Meynert is affected in Alzheimer's disease.
Biochemically, there is a reduction of acetylcholine and degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert that project throughout the cortex. There is also noradrenergic and
serotonergic depletion due to degeneration of brain stem nuclei such as the locus ceruleus and the dorsal raphe.
Microscopically, there are neuritic plaques containing amyloid-β , neurofibrillary tangles, and amyloid-β accumulation in the blood vessel walls of the cortex and leptomeninges.
The FDA recently approved Flortaucipir F18 for intravenous injection, the first radioactive
diagnostic agent for adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for
Alzheimer’s disease. It is indicated for PET imaging of the brain to estimate the density and
distribution of aggregated tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a primary marker of Alzheimer’s disease.","","C",""
