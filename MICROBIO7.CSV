Q1,"A 35-year-old HIV positive¦ patient presents with mucosal lesions in the mouth as shown in the image below. on microscopy, budding yeasts and pseudohyphae are seen. what is the
likely diagnosis?","a)oral candidiasis
b)Hairy leukoplakia
c)Lichen planus
d)Diphtheria","An HIV patient with white patches over the tonsils and posterior pharynx showing budding yeasts and pseudohyphae on microscopy suggests a diagnosis of oral candidiasis.
oral candidiasis or thrush is a patchy, pseudomembranous lesion that develops over the tongue, lips, gum or palate. It is composed of epithelial cells, yeasts, and pseudohyphae and can be
scraped off. The causative agent is usually candida albicans. It occurs in almost all individuals    with AIDS. other risk factors include hyperglycemia, cellular immunodeficiency, corticosteroids or antibiotics. It is treated with topical nystatin, oral ketoconazole or fluconazole.
option B: Hairy leukoplakia is a wart-like growth on the tongue, caused by Epstein-Barr virus. It is commonly seen as a white lesion on the lateral side of the tongue.
option c: Lichen planus is a pruritic disease characterized by papules commonly seen over the flexor surfaces and trunk. oral and vulvovaginal lesions may also occur. oral lesions appear as lacy, white, and raised lesions.
option D: Diphtheria is characterized by the presence of a grey pseudomembrane covering the tonsils and pharynx. It is caused by corynebacterium diphtheriae.",1479-903.PNG,A,
Q2,zika virus is transmitted by:,"a) Aedes aegypti
b)culex
c)Anopheles
d)papatasii","zika virus is transmitted by the bite of infected Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.

Q4,Identify the class of immunoglobulin¦ shown in the image below.,"a)Ig A
b)Ig G
c)Ig M
d)Ig E","The above image shows a dimeric structure, characteristic of secretory IgA.
IgA immunoglobulin is the major antibody responsible for mucosal immunity. Its serum levels are usually low. It is predominantly present in the extravascular secretions. It is present in secretions  such as milk, saliva, and tears, and in secretions of the respiratory, intestinal, and genital tracts.
when present in the serum, it exists as a monomer similar to IgG. However, when it is secreted, it exists as a dimer. The dimeric structure consists of two monomers, which are stabilized by two
additional polypeptides:

• J chain, which stabilizes the molecule.
• secretory component, which is incorporated into the IgA when transported through the epithelial cell.",1480-904.PNG,A,1491-913.PNG
Q5,A 14-year-old boy presents with a history of vomiting within 3 hours of consumption of food at a party. which of the following organism is most likely to cause these symptoms?,"a)staphylococcus aureus
b)clostridium botulinum
c)clostridium perfringes
d)salmonella typhi","vomiting 2 hours after the consumption of food is likely food poisoning by staphylococcus
aureus.
staphylococcus aureus can grow in carbohydrate and protein food sources, producing
enterotoxins. There are 15 types, all of which are superantigens. They are preformed toxins that are relatively heat stable. They stimulate the vagus nerve,  vomiting centre of the brain and
intestinal peristaltic activity. Type A enterotoxin is responsible for most cases of food poisoning.
The common sources of infection are the foods that are not cooked after handling. These include sliced meats, puddings, pastries, and sandwiches. Ingestion of such contaminated food causes
food poisoning within 3o minutes to 6 hours after consumption. Patients present with nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and diarrhoea.",,A,
Q6,which of the following organisms produces superantigen?,"a)staphylococcus epidermidis
b)streptococcus pyogenes
c)Clostridium perfringens
d)vibrio cholera","streptococcus pyogenes produces streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (sPE), which is a superantigen.
superantigens are protein toxins that stimulate large numbers of T cells, irrespective of antigen  specificity. They bind to the class II MHC molecule outside the peptide-binding groove and vß    region of the TCR. some examples of superantigens are staphylococcal enterotoxins, toxic shock syndrome toxin, and group A streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin.
The below image shows the binding of superantigen to T-cell receptor.",,B,1492-914.PNG
Q7,"A female patient who is from the north-eastern part of the country came to the hospital with complaints of progressive swelling of the upper limbs. she has a history of coronary artery     disease for which she underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. on examination, the    upper limbs are more swollen proximally than distally. what is the next best step in the
management of this patient?","a)Echocardiography
b)Night blood test for worms

India.",,B,
Q8,"which of the following helminthic infections, that is commonly transmitted by soil, is characterized by¦ the egg in stool as shown in the image below?","a)Trichuris trichiura
b)Ancyclostoma duodenale
c)Necator americanus
d)Ascaris lumbricoides","The given image shows the egg of Trichuris trichiura (whipworm).
The characteristic features of whipworm eggs are:
• Barrel-shaped in the middle
• projecting colourless mucus plug at each pole
• contains an unsegmented ovum.
• Floast in the saturated salt solution.
• It has a triple shell. The outermost layer is stained brown.
Humans acquire infection by swallowing embryonated eggs in contaminated food or water.  The     eggs hatch in the small intestine, and the larvae produced pass into the cecum. The larvae become mature adults in 2-3 months. Adult females pass immature un-embryonated eggs in the stool.
Thus, diagnosis of whipworm infection is done by microscopic identification of the eggs in a stool specimen.
Most infections are asymptomatic. Moderate whipworm infection (2o adult worms or less), the worms are confined to the caecum and ascending colon. The symptoms include epigastric and
lower abdominal pain, diarrhoea (rarely bloody), vomiting, flatulence and distention, weight loss, and increased blood and iron loss. In heavy infections of 2oo adult worms or more - trichuriasis

dysentery syndrome -, the worms are in the distal colon and rectum. The symptoms include
bloody diarrhoea with profuse mucus, abdominal pain, tenesmus, weight loss leading to cachexia, severe anemia, and rectal prolapse. on examination, clubbing may be present. Blood
investigations may show moderate eosinophilia.
chronic infection leads to growth retardation and nutritional deficiencies. Around o.oo5 ml of   blood is lost per day per worm. In heavy infections, as much as 4 to 5 ml can be lost per day per worm. Treatment is mebendazole or albendazole.",1482-906.PNG,A,1493-915.PNG
Q9,"A 3o-year-old female from tribal area presented with fever for the last 3 days. on examination of the peripheral smear, a diagnosis of malaria was made. which of the following is most
likely to be the causative agent?","a)P. falciparum
b)P. malariae
c)P. ovale
d)P. vivax","The image shows ring forms/ early trophozoites in erythrocyte, which are binucleate (double chromatin) resembling stereo headphones in appearance, characteristic of P. falciparum.

Q10,The test kit shown in the image below works on the principle of:,"a)ELISA
b)Immunochromatography
c)Immunofluroscence
d)Chemiluminiscence","The above image shows a HbsAg card test kit which works on the principle
of immunochromatography.
In immunochromatography, a nitrocellulose membrane is used to absorb the antigen from a
specimen. The membrane is impregnated with anti-HBsAg antibody and colloidal gold dye. The specimen (serum) travels through the membrane by capillary action. If the serum contains
HBaAg, a coloured reaction (in the form of a band) appears directly on the membrane at the test site. These assays are rapid and include a built-in internal control.",1483-907.PNG,B,
Q11,"A 22-year-old student presented with high-grade fever, and purpuric rash as shown in the image below. CSF sample showed gram-negative diplococci. which of the following is the  most likely aetiology?","a)Neisseria meningitidis
b)pseudomonas aeruginosa
c)streptococcus pneumoniae
d)E.coli","This patient has a high-grade fever and is a student, so he presumably spends a lot of time in crowded areas. The above image shows a purpuric rash. This patient's features are seen in
meningococcemia caused by Neisseria meningitidis, which are gram-negative diplococci.
The organism enters the body through the nasopharynx by attaching to the epithelial cells with
the help of pili. From the nasopharynx, they enter the bloodstream producing bacteremia, and the symptoms may resemble upper respiratory tract infection.
Fulminant meningococcemia is the severe form, where the patient presents with high-grade fever and hemorrhagic rash. There is thrombosis of several small blood vessels in various organs with   perivascular infiltration and petechial hemorrhages. some patients with fulminant
meningococcemia may also develop disseminated intravascular coagulation, and circulatory collapse, a condition known as waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome.",1484-908.PNG,A,
Q12,which of the following is the predominant pathogen to infect renal transplant recipients one to four months following transplantation?,"a)cytomegalovirus
b)Jc virus
c)BK virus
d)Epstein-Barr virus","The predominant pathogen to infect renal transplant recipients in the period around 1 to 4 months following the transplantation is cytomegalovirus (CMV).
CMV is the most common virus to affect recipients after organ transplantation (kidney, heart,
lung etc). The maximal risk occurs between 1 and 4 months after transplantation (in the absence    of prophylaxis). The most common CMV presentation in kidney transplant patients includes fever, leukopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, myalgia, and arthralgia.

Q14,which of the following helps in bacterial adhesion?,"a)cytoplasmic membrane
b)Mesosomes
c)Fimbriae
d)Lipopolysaccharides","Fimbriae help in bacterial adhesion.
Fimbriae, also called pili, are hair-like surface appendage that projects from the cell surface as
straight filaments. They are primarily seen in Gram-negative bacteria. They are polymers of pilin. Fimbriae are classified based on the function as ordinary pili - for adhesion - and sex pili -
involved in bacterial conjugation. The functions of pili are given below:
• Bacterial conjugation through sex pili, which transfer of genetic material occurs.
• Bacterial adhesion of symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria to host cells using adhesins.
• Resistance to phagocytosis.
• Antigenic pilin proteins are responsible for the immune response.
• Twitching motility to bacteria.",,C,

b)Entamoeba histolytica
c)Microsporidia
d)cryptosopridia","The histopathology shows trophozoites of Giardia lamblia in the duodenal lumen (marked in arrows).


• Giardia lamblia, also called Giardia duodenalis, is the causative agent of giardiasis. It is the only common pathogenic protozoan found in the duodenum and jejunum of humans.
• Infection is acquired by the consumption of water or food contaminated with cysts and may also be transmitted by the faeco-oral route.
• It is weakly pathogenic in humans. secretory IgA and IL-6 are responsible for clearing the infection. Hence, giardiasis usually occurs in immunosuppressed, agammaglobulinemia, or malnourished individuals.
• The symptoms include acute or chronic diarrhea, weight loss, malaise, abdominal cramps,
distension, and weakness. The stools may be watery, greasy, bulky, or foul-smelling at various times during the course of the infection.

• Histopathology of the duodenum reveals several heart-shaped or pear-shaped trophozoites with two equally sized nuclei. The small intestinal morphology is usually normal. However, in heavy     infections, there may be villous blunting and intraepithelial infiltrates.",1485-909.PNG,A,1496-917.PNG
