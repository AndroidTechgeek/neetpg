Q1,Identify the structure marked in the image.,"a)Fossa of Rosenmuller
b)Tubal tonsil
c)opening of eustachian tube
d)Adenoid","The image shown is the endoscopic view of lateral wall of the nasopharynx, and the marked structure is the fossa of Rosenmuller.
The nasopharynx is present above the soft palate and is made up of the roof, floor, posterior wall, and two lateral walls.
Important structures seen in the nasopharynx are
• pharyngeal opening of the eustachian tube
• Torus tubarius- tubal elevation which is present behind the opening of the eustachian tube.
• Fossa of Rosenmuller - A lateral pharyngeal recess that is present above and behind the torus tubarius. It is the most common site for nasopharyngeal carcinoma
• Adenoids or nasopharyngeal tonsil, which is present in the roof and posterior wall



• passavant's ridge
The tubal tonsil is a collection of subepithelial lymphoid tissue situated at the tubal elevation. It is a part of the waldeyer’s ring and infection can cause eustachian tube occlusion.",3334-2083.PNG,A,3338-2088.PNG;3338-2087.PNG
Q2,A 3o-year-old male presents with nonaxial proptosis ofthe left eye. The patient gives a history of a road traffic accident 15 years back. The CT image is given below. what is the most likely   diagnosis?,"a)Frontal mucocele
b)Frontal meningioma
c)Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma
d)pseudotumor of orbit","The given clinical scenario and the image findings are suggestive of a frontal mucocele.
Mucoceles are slow-growing, mucous-filled benign masses that can develop years after head injury. post-traumatic mucocele formation occurs due to chronic obstruction of the sinus
ostium. The frontal sinus is most commonly involved in mucocele formation.
The sinuses commonly affected by mucocele in the order of frequency are the frontal &gt; ethmoidal &gt; maxillary &gt; sphenoid.



Frontal mucocele presents with headache, diplopia, and proptosis. A cystic non-tender swelling is noticed with eggshell crackling.
The image given below shows a coronal MRI demonstrating a frontal mucocele and an orbital cystic mass.


other options:
option B: Frontal meningiomas are benign brain tumors presenting with headaches, seizures, vomiting, sensory and motor weakness, and visual impairment.
option C: Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is a benign neoplasm of the nasopharynx presenting with spontaneous recurrent epistaxis, nasal obstruction, and nasal discharge.
option D: pseudotumor of the orbit is an idiopathic inflammation of the orbit presenting with   painful proptosis, diplopia, and orbital congestion. Imaging shows swollen eye muscles (orbital myositis) and enlarged tendons.",3335-2085.PNG,A,3339-2089.PNG
Q3,The instrument shown in the image is not used for which of the following?,"a)Airway toileting
b)upper airway examination
c)Acute nasopharyngeal obstruction
d)prolonged mechanical ventilation","The image shows a tracheostomy tube. It is not used for upper airway examination.
Tracheostomy involves making an opening and placing a stoma in the anterior wall of the trachea.
Functions:
• provides an alternative pathway for breathing by bypassing the obstruction.
• Improves alveolar ventilation by reducing dead space by 3o-5o% and reducing airway resistance
• uses a cuff to protect the airways from secretions and blood
• Allows suction of secretions in the setting of the impaired cough reflex.
• Allows positive pressure respiration



• Allows administration of anesthesia
Indications:
• Respiratory obstruction due to
• Infections (laryngo-tracheo-bronchitis, epiglottitis, diphtheria)
• Trauma due to external injury, mandibular or maxillofacial fractures
• Neoplasms
• Foreign bodies or edema
• Bilateral abductor paralysis
• congenital anomalies
• Retained secretions
• Inability to cough due to coma, spasm, or paralysis of respiratory muscles
• Aspiration of pharyngeal secretions
• painful cough
• Respiratory insufficiency due to emphysema, chronic bronchitis",3335-2084.PNG,B,
Q4,"A 1o-year-old child presents with throat pain, fever, and ear pain. He is diagnosed with recurrent tonsillitis. which nerve is responsible for the ear pain in this patient?","a)Tympanic branch of glossopharyngeal nerve
b)Greater auricular nerve
c)Auriculotemporal nerve
d)Auricular branch ofvagus nerve","The tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX) is responsible for referred otalgia from tonsillitis.
The tonsils and tonsillar fossa are supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve. The glossopharyngeal  nerve and the styloid process lie in relation to the lower part of the tonsillar fossa. Therefore, any irritation or pain can be referred to the ear along the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal
(Jacobson's) nerve.
The image below shows the anatomic relations of the tonsil and tonsillar bed.






The ear receives extensive sensory innervation via four cranial nerves (V, VII, IX, and X) and two spinal segments (c2 and c3).
Referred otalgia transmitted by the glossopharyngeal nerve may be secondary to lesions and/or    inflammatory processes of the nasopharynx, palatine tonsil, soft palate, or posterior one-third of the tongue.
causes of referred otalgia via glossopharyngeal nerve:
• Acute pharyngitis
• Tonsillitis
• peritonsillitis
• peritonsillar abscess
• post-tonsillectomy
• Foreign bodies embedded in the base of the tongue or tonsillar area
• Elongated styloid process
other options:
option B: The great auricular nerve provides sensory sensation for the lower two-thirds of the pinna.
option c: causes of referred pain via the auriculotemporal nerve which is the branch of the
trigeminal nerve include caries tooth, ulcerative lesions of the oral cavity, temporomandibular joint disorders, and sphenopalatine neuralgia.
option D: causes of referred pain via the auricular branch of the vagus nerve include malignancy or ulcerative lesion of the vallecula, epiglottis, larynx, and esophagus.",,A,3294-2049.PNG
Q5,"A 55-year-old patient comes with hoarseness of voice and difficulty swallowing. The patient was diagnosed with laryngeal carcinoma and surgical management was done. The
post-operative image of the patient is given below. which of the following surgery was done on this patient?","a)partial laryngectomy
b)percutaneous tracheostomy
c)standard tracheostomy
d)Total laryngectomy","The given image shows a post-operative tracheal stump created for breathing in patients undergoing total laryngectomy for laryngeal carcinoma.
In total laryngectomy, the entire larynx, including the hyoid bone, pre-epiglottic space, strap
muscles, and one or more rings of trachea, are removed. The pharyngeal wall is repaired, and the tracheal stump is sutured to the skin to allow respiration.
The indications of total laryngectomy are as follows:
• T3 lesions
• All T4 lesions
• Invasion of thyroid or cricoid cartilage
• Bilateral arytenoid cartilage involvement
• Lesions of the posterior commissure
• Failure after radiotherapy or conservation surgery



• Transglottic cancers with cord fixation
It is contraindicated in patients with distant metastasis.
other options:
option A: partial laryngectomy is a conservation procedure that involves the excision of the vocal cord and anterior commissure region in partial front lateral laryngectomy and the excision of
supraglottis in partial horizontal laryngectomy. This surgery is performed to conserve the voice and avoid a permanent tracheal opening.
option B: percutaneous tracheostomy is done in ICU patients under sedation when the patient is already intubated and being monitored. The image below shows the procedure of percutaneous    tracheostomy.


option C: standard tracheostomy can be therapeutic (used for respiratory obstruction, remove    tracheobronchial secretions or assisted ventilation) and prophylactic (for anticipated respiratory obstruction or aspiration of blood or pharyngeal secretions).",3336-2086.PNG,D,3342-2090.PNG
Q6,"A female patient with hearing loss is examined and is found to be Rinne negative at 256 Hz and 512 Hz, while Rinne positive at 1o24 Hz. what is the expected air conduction and bone conduction gap?","a)3o-45 dB
b)15-3o dB
c)45-6o dB
d)&gt;6o dB","The given clinical scenario of hearing loss with a negative Rinne at 256 Hz and 512 Hz and positive Rinne at 1024 Hz indicates air conduction and bone conduction gap of 30-45 dB.
Tuning fork tests are performed commonly with tuning forks of frequencies such as 128, 256, 512, and 1024. The tuning fork of 512 Hz is considered ideal as forks oflower frequencies produce a
sense of bone vibration, while those of higher frequencies have a shorter decay time.
Rinne’s test is done by placing a vibrating tuning fork on the patient’s mastoid and when he stops hearing, it is brought beside the external auditory meatus (EAC). If he still hears the sound, air
conduction (AC) is better than bone conduction (BC).
The inferences are as follows:



• Rinne's test is considered positive (normal) when the air conduction AC&gt;BC is seen in normal people and people with sensorineural deafness.
• It is considered negative when the BC&gt;AC, and is seen in patients with conductive deafness. It suggests a minimum hearing loss of 15-2o dB.
A prediction of the air-bone gap can be made using tuning forks of 256, 512, and 1o24 Hz:
• A Rinne test negative for 256 Hz but positive for 512 Hz indicates an air-bone gap of 2o-3o dB.
• A Rinne test negative for 256 and 512 Hz but positive for 1o24 Hz indicates an air-bone gap of 3o-45 dB.
• A Rinne negative for 256, 512, and 1o24 Hz indicates an air-bone gap of 45-6o dB.",,A,
