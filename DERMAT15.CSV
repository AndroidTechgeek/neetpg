Q1,"A child presents with orangish hue skin with rough and scaly skin as shown in the image. on histopathological examination, orthokeratosis and parakeratosis are seen. what is the most    likely diagnosis?","a)Follicular psoriasis
b)Lichen planus
c)pityriasis rubra pilaris.
d)keratosis follicularis","The image shows prominent erythema and scale on the palms ofthe hands and wrists with
marked orange■yellow palmoplantar keratoderma which is a feature of pityriasis rubra pilaris.
Features of pityriasis rubra pilaris:
• salmon red or orange red-coloured dry scaly plaques are seen characteristically, which coalesce together, leaving islands of normal skin, typically known as 'islands of sparing' in between the
lesions
• Most common site - trunk
• on the elbow and wrist, nutmeg grater papules are seen due to follicular hyperkeratosis
• palmoplantar keratoderma - keratoderma on the sole is very thick that it appears as a sandal. (keratotic sandal)



• Nails - thickened, discoloured distally, showing splinter haemorrhages
Histologically, pityriasis rubra pilaris is characterized by hyperkeratosis with follicular plugging, alternating ortho- and parakeratosis, dilated but non-tortuous dermal capillaries, sparse
lymphocytic infiltrate, and possible acantholysis in the adnexal epithelium.
The image below shows islands of sparing in pityriasis rubra pilaris.


The image below shows keratotic sandal.


other options:
option A: Follicular psoriasis affects hair follicles on the trunk and limbs and can occur alone or alongside plaque psoriasis. The lesions are smaller than those seen in guttate psoriasis and may  appear clustered or spread out. In children, it can be mistaken for pityriasis rubra pilaris.
option B: Lichen planus is a papulosquamous lesion presenting as pruritic, purple, polygonal, planar, papules and plaques. These papules are often highlighted by white dots or lines called



wickham striae, which are created by areas of hypergranulosis.
option D: keratosis follicularis or Darier's disease or dyskeratosis follicularis, is an autosomal
dominant condition arising from mutations in the ATP2A2 gene which affects the SERcA2
calcium pump. It presents with greasy hyperkeratotic papules and plaques in seborrheic regions. Neuropsychiatric features such as depression, psychosis and mental retardation may also occur.",3734-2396.PNG,C,3743-2408.PNG
Q2,A patient presented with a slight loss of sensation along the ulnar nerve and a solitary nodule in the forearm. Intradermal antigen was injected. The histopathology image is shown below.  which of the following is true regarding this condition?,"a)Lepromatous leprosy with dermal test positive
b)Tuberculoid leprosy with dermal test positive
c)Lepromatous leprosy with dermal test negative
d)Erythema nodosum leprosum with negative skin test","The patient’s slight loss of sensation along the ulnar nerve, solitary forearm nodule, and
histopathology showing well-defined granulomas indicate tuberculoid leprosy with a dermal test positive.
In tuberculoid leprosy, dermal granulomas, consisting of groups of epithelioid cells with giant
cells, are seen. The granulomas are elongated and generally run parallel to the surface, following  neurovascular bundles. The granulomas extend up to the epidermis, thereby obscuring the Grenz zone. It also shows high positivity of the lepromin skin (dermal) test.
Leprosy is a chronic granulomatous condition caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It affects the skin, cutaneous and peripheral nerves, and mucous membranes. The most commonly affected
peripheral nerves are the posterior tibial nerve, followed by the ulnar, median, and lateral
popliteal nerves. The most frequently involved cranial nerve is the facial nerve. It has a long
incubation period, usually 2 to 12 years. It commonly presents as an area of numbness on the skin or a visible skin lesion, which could be a hypopigmented or erythematous macule.
The Grenz zone is most prominent in lepromatous leprosy, as there are scarce granulomas to fill up the space. It is also seen in the borderline spectrum.


cardinal signs for the diagnosis of leprosy:
• characteristic skin lesions- hypopigmented or erythematous lesions with definite impairment of sensation.



• Peripheral nerve involvement- thickening of the nerve with sensory impairment. Nerve tenderness can also be seen.
• Detection of acid-fast bacilli in slit-skin smear, skin biopsy, or positive biopsy PCR.
The presence of two of the three signs can establish the diagnosis of leprosy. other tests done for  diagnosis of leprosy include nerve biopsy in pure neural leprosy and PGL-1 antibody in cases with low bacterial load.",3735-2398.PNG,B,3744-2410.PNG
Q3,which of the following is associated with the'' box sign''?,"a)Lichen planus
b)Lichen nitidus
c)Morphea
d)Amyloidosis","The ""box sign"" is associated with morphea, also known as localized scleroderma.
Morphea is a condition characterized by localized skin sclerosis and fibrosis due to increased
collagen deposition. This can lead to well-defined, box-like patches of thickened, hardened skin.
The ""box sign"" refers to the sharp, boxy edges of these lesions, which can vary in depth and extent, sometimes involving deeper tissues such as muscle and bone.
Biopsies taken during the indurative stage often display squared-off edges, resulting in a
""box-shaped"" or ""boxed dermis"" appearance under the microscope, which can vary in depth and extent, sometimes involving deeper tissues such as muscle and bone. This characteristic sign
occurs because of extensive collagen sclerosis throughout the reticular dermis and extending into the subcutaneous fat septa. The pronounced sclerosis of the collagen fibers causes this distinct
boxy appearance. similar squared-off edges may also be observed in morphea-lichen sclerosus overlap and scleredema, due to comparable changes in the dermal and subcutaneous tissue
structure.
The epidermis in morphea can exhibit varying changes, from normal to flattened with loss of rete ridges, or slightly acanthotic. In the inflammatory phase, the reticular dermis shows edema and a dense perivascular infiltrate, which gradually gives way to thickened, horizontally oriented
collagen bundles. The loss of adnexal structures, such as hair follicles and eccrine glands, is
common, and the subcutaneous fat may be replaced by collagen, contributing to the appearance of a ""box sign.""
Management of morphea focuses on controlling inflammation and preventing disease
progression. Early intervention is crucial and may include topical treatments like corticosteroids or tacrolimus for localized lesions. For more extensive or resistant cases, phototherapy and
systemic treatments, such as methotrexate or oral corticosteroids, may be considered. The choice of therapy often depends on the extent and activity of the disease, with the goal of minimizing
skin damage and improving functional outcomes.
other options:
option A: Lichen planus is a papulosquamous lesion presenting as pruritic, purple, polygonal, planar, papules and plaques. These papules are often highlighted by white dots or lines called  wickham striae, which are created by areas of hypergranulosis.
The characteristic lesions in lichen planus is shown below:





option B: Lichen nitidus is a rare variant of lichen planus, where both are histologically similar in early lesions. It is mostly seen in children and young adults. Lesions of lichen nitidus are typically described as a minute pinpoint to pinhead-size, flat or dome-shaped papules with a shiny surface. They are most commonly found over the forearm, dorsum of the penis, abdomen, chest, and
buttocks.


option D: Amyloidosis refers to extracellular deposits of fibrillar proteins. The kidney is the most common organ involved in amyloidosis. Abnormal fibrils are produced by the aggregation of
misfolded proteins. The fibrillar deposits bind a wide variety of proteoglycans and
glycosaminoglycans, including heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate, and plasma proteins,    notably serum amyloid P component (SAP). Amyloid appears as an amorphous, eosinophilic, hyaline, extracellular substance.",3735-2397.PNG,C,3675-2349.PNG;3746-2411.PNG
Q4,A 32-year-old man presents with painful vesicular lesions over the genital area. He has a history of multiple sexual partners and inconsistent condom use. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)chancroid
b)Genital Herpes
c)primary syphillis
d)Granuloma inguinale","The most likely diagnosis for this patient with painful vesicular lesions over the genital area is genital herpes.
The diagnosis of genital herpes is suggested by the presence of painful, multiple vesicular ulcers  clustered on the genitalia, along with inguinal lymphadenopathy. These symptoms are indicative of an infection caused by the Herpes Simplex virus-2 (HSv-2), which is the primary cause of
genital herpes.
Genital herpes is characterized by vesiculoulcerative lesions, which appear as grouped vesicles
filled with clear fluid on the penis in males or on the cervix, vulva, vagina, and perineum in
females. The painful nature of these lesions, combined with the history of multiple sexual partners and inconsistent condom use, supports the diagnosis. Recurrences of genital herpes are common   and generally tend to be milder compared to the initial outbreak.
other options:
option A: Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi may also present with soft wide indurated painful genital ulcers and painful genital lymphadenopathy.
option C: In primary syphilis, the typical primary chancre usually begins as a single painless papule that rapidly becomes eroded and usually becomes indurated, with a characteristic
cartilaginous consistency on palpation of the edge and base of the ulcer.
option D: Granuloma inguinale (also known as donovanosis) is caused by klebsiella granulomatis. It presents with a painless papule or nodule that erodes into a beefy red granulomatous ulcer with rolled edges and often no lymphadenopathy.",3736-2399.PNG,B,
Q5,"An adult male presented with asymptomatic macules over the chest, moist grey, perianal
lesions, and findings on the scalp as shown. what is the most likely causative organism of this condition?","a)Malassezia
b)Trichophyton
c)Treponema pallidum
d)Microsporum","The most likely causative organism for this condition is Treponema pallidum, which caused the asymptomatic macules on the chest, moist grey, perianal lesions, and moth-eaten pattern
alopecia seen in secondary syphilis.
The causative organism for this condition is Treponema pallidum, a spirochete bacterium. In
secondary syphilis, the macular or roseolar rash is often the earliest sign, which may fade, leaving hypopigmented areas around the neck, known as leucoderma syphiliticum or ""necklace of venus."" This stage also features a papular rash that can appear on the palms and soles.
Additionally, secondary syphilis can present with nummular lesions that resemble psoriasis, often with easily removable scales due to serous discharge. on the oral mucosa, papules may form grey  oval patches, leading to ""snail-track"" ulcers (as shown below).





Condyloma lata, which are moist, well-demarcated papules and plaques, are commonly seen in
the genital area and are highly infectious. syphilitic alopecia, characterized by non-scarring patchy hair loss, and generalized lymphadenopathy are also notable features.
The systemic manifestations of secondary syphilis include panuveitis, periostitis, joint effusions,  and involvement of various organs such as the kidneys, liver, and heart. The lesions in secondary syphilis typically resolve spontaneously, transitioning into the latent stage of the disease.",3737-2401.PNG,C,3748-2413.PNG
Q6,Match the structures shown in the image:,"a)A- Apocrine sweat gland; B- Eccrine sweat gland; C- sebaceous gland; D- Erector pili muscle
b)A- Eccrine sweat gland; B- Apocrine sweat gland; C- sebaceous gland; D- Erector pili muscle
c)A- sebaceous gland; B- Apocrine sweat gland; C- Eccrine sweat gland; D- Erector pili muscle
d)A- Eccrine sweat gland; B- sebaceous gland; C- Apocrine sweat gland; D- Erector pili muscle","The correctly matched option (B)- A- Eccrine sweat gland; B- Apocrine sweat gland; C- sebaceous gland; D- Erector pili muscle.




Human skin contains various structures, including sweat and sebaceous glands. Eccrine sweat
glands, which are crucial for temperature regulation, are distributed across most of the body and   are identified early in fetal development. These glands have a coiled secretory portion in the lower dermis and a duct that opens directly onto the skin surface. They are most concentrated on the
palms, soles, and forehead.
Apocrine sweat glands, found in areas like the axillae, genital, and mammary regions, differ from eccrine glands in that they release secretion via decapitation, where parts of the cell pinch off.
They are connected to hair follicles and have a larger lumen compared to eccrine glands. Their primary function remains unclear, and they have a lower secretory output.
sebaceous glands secrete sebum, providing skin lubrication and waterproofing. These glands are associated with hair follicles and are absent in non-hairy skin.
The erector pili muscle, a smooth muscle bundle, extends from the dermis to the follicle wall and is involved in hair erection.",3737-2400.PNG,B,3748-2412.PNG
Q7,which of the following causes the condition shown in the image below?,"a)Candida albicans
b)Trichophyton species
c)Epidermophyton floccosum
d)Microsporum species","The above image shows numerous fungal spores within the hair shaft suggestive of endothrix type of tinea capitis, which is caused by Trichophyton tonsurans.
Tinea capitis is of four types:
other options:
option A: candida is the most common cause of opportunistic mycoses in the world.
Immunocompromised individuals are at an increased risk of systemic candidiasis. clinically,
infection with candida can present as cutaneous &amp; mucosal candidiasis, systemic candidiasis, or rarely, as chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.
Morphologically, they are yeast-like fungi. It appears as budding gram-positive yeast cells with pseudohyphae
option c: Epidermophyton floccosum: Distinguished by absent microconidia and club-shaped macroconidia, which are smooth, thick-walled, and occur in clusters. It is a dermatophyte
responsible for superficial fungal infections of the skin, particularly tinea pedis (athlete’s foot), tinea cruris (jock itch), and tinea unguium (nail infection).
option D: Tinea cruris, a superficial fungal skin infection that affects the groin area, is primarily caused by Epidermophyton floccusum. Typical symptoms include redness and inflammation in   the groin region, accompanied by sensations of itching, burning, or stinging. The characteristic   lesions exhibit raised borders surrounding a central clearing, thus imparting a ring-like
appearance.

Q8,"A 65-year-old treated leprosy patient came with complaints of a well-demarcated, non-tender ulcer on his foot with hyperkeratotic borders as given below for the last 3 months. what
should be the appropriate next step?","a)Restart MDT
b)Rest the limb, non weight bearing splints and foot care
c)Admit the patient and aggressive debridement and antibiotics
d)Amputation","The given scenario and the image indicate a neuropathic ulcer. This can be managed by limb rest, utilising non-weight-bearing splints, and administering foot care.
Leprosy, a condition affecting the skin and peripheral nerves, results in peripheral neuropathy
and subsequent loss of sensation. This can lead to the development of chronic trophic or
neuropathic ulcers characterised by punched-out appearance, regular margins, and calluses due to repeated trauma in the presence of anaesthesia of feet.
Management primarily focuses on relieving pressure through the application of non-weight
bearing splints for even pressure distribution across the entire foot, limb elevation to mitigate swelling, and regular foot inspection to promptly identify trauma, in addition to the use of
microcellular rubber footwear.
other options:
option A: Trophic ulcers are not an indication for restarting MDT in an already treated leprosy patient.
option c: Due to the absence of debris or signs of infection in the ulcer, aggressive debridement and antibiotics are not indicated.
option D: As there are no signs of vascular compromise or gangrene, amputation of the limb is not required.",3739-2404.PNG,B,
Q9,"A man presents with multiple lesions on his face and upper back, diagnosed as acne vulgaris. which of the following is the most effective treatment for his symptoms?","a)systemic Minocycline
b)systemic Isoretinoin
c)systemic Doxycycline
d)Topical Dapsone","The presence of multiple nodular and cystic lesions over the face and upper back implies that this is a case of acne vulgaris. systemic Isotretinoin is the most effective treatment for acne.
systemic retinoids are a very efficient treatment for acne vulgaris. Their mechanism of action si by inhibiting the formation of keratin, a protein that can clog pores and cause acne. oral retinoids
are usually reserved for severe cases of acne that do not respond to topical creams and gels.
Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit. comedonal lesions are the earliest lesions of acne. They represent the keratin plugs of the pilosebaceous duct.
when the keratin plug is inside the follicle, it is called a closed comedone (whitehead). when the keratin plug is exposed to the environment, it gets oxidized by the air and turns black which is
known as open comedone (blackhead).",3739-2403.PNG,B,
Q10,"A 42-year-old man comes with vesicular eruptions in the buccal mucosa. Direct
immunofluorescence is done and the image is shown below. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Lupus vulgaris
b)pemphigus vulgaris
c)Bullous pemphigoid
d)Borderline Leprosy","The given image shows a characteristic fish-net appearance on direct immunofluorescence, which is diagnostic of pemphigus vulgaris.
This pattern is due to intraepidermal intercellular deposition of IgG and C3.
Direct or indirect immunofluorescence cannot be used to differentiate between pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus, as they present similarly.
other options:
option A: Lupus vulgaris(Cutaneous TB) is the most common form of cutaneous tuberculosis in adults. The characteristic lesion is a plaque, composed of soft, reddish brown papules, the
appearance on the diascopy being said to resemble apple jelly. The image below shows the characteristic lesion:


option C: Bullous pemphigoid present linear or shoreline pattern is seen due to IgG and C3 deposits along the dermo-epidermal junctions, as seen in the following image.






option D: In borderline leprosy, inverted-saucer-shaped lesions are seen and are characterized by a dome-shaped appearance with central infiltration and a gradually sloping peripheral edge.",3740-2405.PNG,B,3751-2415.PNG;3751-2414.PNG
Q11,A 3-year-old boy had patches of partial hair loss with mild itching and scales. The picture of   his scalp is shown below. His sister also has a similar condition. which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)Alopecia areata
b)Tinea capitis
c)pediculis capitis
d)pyoderma scalp","patchy hair loss and multiple black dots within the areas of alopecia along with fine scaling and itching of the scalp point towards the diagnosis of tinea capitis.
Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection primarily occurring in children. clinical features of tinea capitis are patchy hair loss, scaling, tender lymphadenopathy, and in severe cases, there might be  pustules and crusting of the affected area along with sinus formation.
The clinical variants of tinea capitis are:
Endothrix - a non-inflammatory type in which multiple black dots are present within the areas of alopecia. It is most commonly caused by T. tonsurans and T. violaceum.
Ectothrix - a mild inflammatory type in which single or multiple scaly patches with hair loss are seen. Microsporum audouinii, M.canis, M.equinnum, and M.ferrugineum cause ectothrix
infection.
kerion - a severe inflammatory type that presents with an inflammatory mass with thick crusting   and matting of hair with pus and sinus formation. It is commonly caused by T. verrucosum and T. mentagrophytes.
Favus - is characterized by the presence of yellowish, cup■shaped crusts known as scutula that develop around hair follicles. It is caused by T. schoenleinii.
other options:
option A: Alopecia areata is a chronic inflammatory disease causing non-scarring hair loss. It is characterized by a circumscribed, smooth patch of hair loss. Exclamation mark hairs are often    seen at the margins of the bald patches during active phases of the disease.



The image below shows alopecia areata.


option C : pediculis Capitis (head louse infestation) is very common in children. The majority of the transmission is by head-to-head contact, which is frequently observed with overcrowding (as in schools), poverty, and poor hygiene.
symptoms include severe itching of the scalp. on examinations, nits are seen, which are firmly attached to hair shafts on which they can be freely glided.


option D : pyoderma of the scalp is an idiopathic cutaneous disorder. It is characterized by
progressive painful ulceration which can cause destruction of underlying structures. It is a benign lesion, which typically develops after truama to that area.",3741-2407.PNG,B,3753-2417.PNG;3753-2416.PNG
Q12,"A middle aged man comes with complaints of painless progressively enlarging lesions on his scalp and perianal region for the last 3 months. He has had liver and kidney transplant 2
years back and is on Mycophenolate Mofetil, Tacrolimus and prednisolone for his immunosupression. which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Drug induced eruption
b)Malakoplakia
c)cutaneous TB
d)pyoderma Gangrenosum","clinical scenario of painless progressive nodular, ulcerated lesions in an immuno-compromised patient with the clinical image showing yellow-erythematous-purple plaque and histopathology  image showing Michaelis–Gutmann bodies are consistent with the diagnosis of cutaneous
malakoplakia.
Malakoplakia is a rare inflammatory condition that typically occurs in the urinary tract. The
cutaneous form of malakoplakia is less prevalent and it most commonly occurs in the perianal or genital regions. . It is caused due to acquired defects in phagocyte function, chronic bacterial
infection by Escherichia coli or proteus species, and immunosuppression (renal transplant patients).
The term malakoplakia means soft plaques. Grossly, malakoplakia appears as soft, yellow, slightly raised mucosal plaques.
Microscopically, they are composed of large, foamy macrophages mixed with occasional
multinucleate giant cells and lymphocytes. The macrophages in malakoplakia have abundant
granular cytoplasm due to phagosomes stuffed with undigested bacterial products and
intracellular deposition of calcium and iron within enlarged lysosomes form laminated basophilic concretions. These are known as Michaelis–Gutmann bodies, pathognomonic of malakoplakia
(shown below).


The image given below shows the von kossa stain demonstrating calcium and iron-containing Michaelis-Gutman bodies (MG bodies) in malakoplakia.





other options :
option A : Drug induced eruption can mimic a wide range of dermatoses. They can develop due to traditional pharmaceutical agents, biologic agents and targeted immunotherapeutic agents, food     additives, and dyes. The morphologies of dryg induced eruptions can be morbilliform, urticarial,    papulosquamous, pustular, and bullous.
option c : cutaneous TB (Lupus vulgaris) is the most common form of cutaneous tuberculosis in adults. The characteristic lesion is a plaque, composed of soft, reddish brown papules, the
appearance on diascopy being said to resemble apple jelly.
option D : pyoderma gangrenosum is a non■infectious neutrophilic dermatosis commonly
associated with inflammatory bowel disease. central necrosis and ulceration of the epidermis and dermis surrounded by a strong inflammatory cell infiltrate are typical findings.",3741-2406.PNG,B,
