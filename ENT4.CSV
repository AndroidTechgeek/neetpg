Q1,A patient underwent total laryngectomy for laryngeal cancer. Identify the modality of voice production in this patient shown in the image given below.,"a)Electro-larynx
b)chicago implant
c)Tracheoesophageal prosthesis
d)Esophageal speech","The modality of voice production shown in the given image is a tracheoesophageal voice prosthesis.
In a tracheoesophageal prosthesis, the exhaled air from the trachea is diverted to the esophagus    through a device that connects the trachea and esophagus. It has a one-way valve, which prevents food from entering into the trachea. A variety of tracheoesophageal prostheses are available
including the provox, Blom-singer, and panje devices.
other options:
option A: Electrolarynx is a vibrating device that produces a low-pitched sound in the
hypopharynx. It is then articulated by the palate, tongue, and teeth.


option B: chicago implant is a hearing aid.
option D: In oesophageal speech, the patient is trained to swallow air and slowly release it into the pharynx. 6-1o words can be spoken in a rough manner before re-swallowing the air.",3218-1973.PNG,C,3224-1979.PNG
Q2,Anterior most air cells of anterior ethmoidal sinus are known as?,"a)Bulla ethmoidalis
b)onodi cell
c)Agger nasi
d)Haller cell","Agger nasi is the anterior-most air cells of anterior ethmoid air cells. when enlarged it may cause mechanical obstruction to frontal sinus drainage.
other options:
option A: Bulla ethmoidalis is the largest air cell in the ethmoidal air sinus. It is situated behind the uncinate process and forms the posterior boundary of hiatus semilunaris through which the  maxillary, frontal, and anterior ethmoidal sinuses drain.
The image below shows the ethmoidal bulla:


option B: onodi cell is formed from posterior ethmoidal air cell. The optic nerve lies in its lateral wall and can be injured while operating in the cells.

The image below shows onodi air cell:


option D: Haller cells are formed from either anterior or posterior ethmoid air cells. They present in relation to the floor of the orbit and roof of the maxillary sinus, enlargement may prevent
drainage of the maxillary sinus.

Q3,A patient complaining of vertigo without hearing loss has consulted an ENT surgeon. The   surgeon performs a diagnostic maneuver and cautiously performs a therapeutic maneuver. what is the diagnostic maneuver?,"a)Hampton's maneuver
b)Dix-Hallpike maneuver
c)Epley's maneuver
d)simon's maneuver","The given clinical scenario of a patient with vertigo without hearing loss is suggestive of benign
paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The diagnostic maneuver used in BPPV is the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, the gold standard for diagnosing BPPV. The therapeutic maneuver is Epley's
maneuver.

BPPV is characterized by vertigo, recurrent brief (&lt;1 minute) episodes triggered by specific head movements, and is not associated with hearing loss or other neurological symptoms.
It is thought to be caused by the dislodgement of crystals of calcium carbonate from the
degenerating macula of the utricle. when this crystal settles on the cupula of the posterior canal, it causes displacement of the cupula and vertigo.
A patient presenting with vertigo should be evaluated for ruling out the central lesions (like a
tumor in the fourth ventricle, cerebellum, temporal lobe, or multiple sclerosis) before confirming the diagnosis of BPPV. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver helps to differentiate a peripheral from a
central lesion.
Dix-Hallpike maneuver: The maneuver starts with the patient in a sitting position. Their head is   turned 45 degrees towards the ear to be tested. Then the examiner quickly brings the patient to a supine position with their head 3o degrees below the horizontal. The 45-degree head rotation is    maintained during the procedure. Now the examiner observes the patient for nystagmus.


The features of nystagmus differentiate between BPPV and central lesions:
The therapeutic maneuver is the Epley maneuver which displaces the otolith out ofthe posterior canal. This ends the sensation of vertigo with positional changes relieving the symptoms.

Nystagmus	BPPV	central lesions
Latency	2-2o seconds	No latency
Duration	<1 minute	>1 minute
Direction	fixed, towards the lower-plac ed ear	changing
The result on repetitions of t he test	nystagmus is not seen (fatigu able)	nystagmus persists (nonfatig uable)
symptoms during the test	severe vertigo	Absent/mild",,B,3227-1984.PNG;3228-1986.PNG

Q6,which of the following is not a branch of the external carotid artery in kiesselbach’s plexus?,"a)Anterior and posterior ethmoidal
b)sphenopalatine artery
c)Greater palatine artery
d)septal branch of superior labial","Anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries are branches of the ophthalmic artery which in turn is a branch of the internal carotid artery.
kiesselbach’s plexus is an arterial anastomosis at the anterior inferior part of the nasal septum
(Little's area). It includes the anterior ethmoidal artery, septal branch of the superior labial artery,

septal branch of the sphenopalatine artery, and septal branch of the greater palatine artery. It is the usual site of epistaxis in children and young adults.
The blood supply of the nasal septum can be divided into two main systems, the internal carotid system, and the external carotid system.
• Internal carotid system: Branches of the ophthalmic artery, anterior ethmoidal artery, and posterior ethmoidal artery.
• External carotid system: sphenopalatine artery (branch of the maxillary artery) gives
nasopalatine and posterior medial nasal branches, septal branch of the greater palatine artery (branch of the maxillary artery), and septal branch of the superior labial artery (branch of the  facial artery).",,A,3197-1963.PNG

Q12,"A 55-year-old female came to the hospital with a history of trauma to the ear. on
examination, there is swelling, tenderness, and discoloration of the ear. which of the following is false regarding the given image?","a)All cases should receive prophylactic antibiotic
b)May lead to pugilistic ear
c)caused by accumulation of blood in perichondrial space
d)Resolves spontaneously","The given clinical history of trauma to the ear along with swelling, tenderness, and discoloration    of the pinna is highly suggestive of hematoma of the auricle (perichondrial hematoma). It does not resolve spontaneously.
It is a collection of blood between the auricular cartilage and its perichondrium known as
perichondrial space (option C). It is commonly seen in boxers, wrestlers, and rugby players due to blunt trauma and can result in a deformity called cauliflower ear, wrestler's ear, or pugilistic
ear (option B). severe perichondritis may occur if the hematoma gets infected.
All cases should receive prophylactic antibiotics (option A). Aspiration of the hematoma under   strict aseptic precautions and a pressure dressing is done to prevent reaccumulation. Aspiration may need to be repeated. when aspiration fails, incision and drainage should be done.",3223-1978.PNG,D,
