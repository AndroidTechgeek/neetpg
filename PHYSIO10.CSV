Question 1,which physiological adaptation does not happen at high altitudes?,"a) pulmonary vasoconstriction
b) polycythemia
c) Respiratory acidosis
d) Hypoxia","The physiological adaptation that does not happen at high altitudes is respiratory acidosis.
Respiratory alkalosis is the physiological adaptation seen at high altitudes due to hyperventilation. It is a method of acclimatization. compensatory mechanisms that are carried out to increase altitude tolerance are called acclimatization.
Following are the physiological changes that occur during acclimatization:
• Hyperventilation leads to respiratory alkalosis and shift of the oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve to the left (and shifts to right after aclimitization).
• Increased erythropoietin secretion, leading to an increase in circulating red blood cells
• Increased number of mitochondria
• Increased myoglobin to facilitate the movement of o2 into the tissues.
• Increased tissue cytochrome oxidase
• Increased sympathetic tone
• Renal suppression of carbonic anhydrase and excretion of dilute alkaline urine brings the pH of the blood to normal.
• Decreased maximal exercise capacity (by ~1% for every 1oo meters gained above 15oo meters)
other options:
option A- In response to the high altitude hypoxia, pulmonary vasoconstriction occurs due to which blood flow is distributed where it is most effective, leading to distribution of blood flow to the pulmonary areas in proportion to their alveolar o2 pressures.
option B- Polycythemia - Erythropoietin secretion increases on the ascent to high altitude which results in polycythemia
option D- Hypoxia - Total barometric pressure decreases as altitude increases, resulting in decreased Po2 (partial pressure of oxygen) leading to hypoxic hypoxia.",,C,
Question 2,countercurrent mechanism is present in which of the following parts of the body?,"a) 1 and 2 are correct
b) 1,2,3 are correct
c) 1,2,3,4,5 are correct
d) 2,3,4,5 are correct","The countercurrent mechanism is present in the testis, kidney, gut, and lungs. when the inflow runs parallel to, counter to, and in close proximity to the outflow for some distance it is called as the counter current mechanism.
spermatogenesis requires a temperature considerably lower than that of the interior of the body. The testes are kept cool by heat exchange in a countercurrent manner between the spermatic arteries and veins.
The concentration of the urine by the kidney requires an osmolality gradient. This gradient is produced by the loop of Henle as counter-current multipliers and maintained by vasa recta as counter-current exchangers.
The functioning of the loop of Henle depends upon:
• The high permeability of the thin descending limb to water ( via aquaporin-1)
• Active transport of Na+ and cl- from the thick ascending limb, thereby diluting the tubular fluid.
• The inflow of tubular fluid from proximal tubule and outflow to the distal tubule.
The countercurrent mechanism is used in the villi to decrease the oxygen availability for local metabolic reactions of the gut. Hence this will increase the blood flow in the intestine during gastrointestinal activity.
countercurrent exchange of oxygen is seen in the lungs as well.",,D,571-500.PNG
Question 3,Match the following molecules with their carriers in plasma:,"a) 1-b, 2-c, 3-d, 4-a
b) 1-a, 2-b, 3-c 4-d
c) 1-a, 2-d, 3-b 4-c
d) 1-b, 2-c, 3-a, 4-d","plasma contains various components like ions, inorganic and organic molecules which help in the transport of substances across various parts of the body. Albumin, globulin, and fibrinogen fractions are important plasma proteins. some of the plasma proteins act as antibodies and are also concerned with blood clotting. where some others are non-specific carriers of hormones, drugs, and other solutes. Majority of plasma proteins are synthesized in the liver. The above table shows some of the proteins synthesized by the liver and the molecules they carry.
Thyroxine is carried by thyroid-binding pre-albumin which is also known as transthyretin.
Albumin is a carrier protein as well as an osmotic regulator which carries hormones, amino acids, vitamins, and steroids too.
Hemopexin binds with heme, particularly for heme recycling.
Haptoglobin binds to free hemoglobin and prevents its excretion in urine.Hence, haptoglobin levels decrease in the presence of free hemoglobin as seen in hemolytic anemia.

Question 4,Myosin ceases to be in contact with actin filaments as a result of:,"a) Dissociation of ADp and pi
b) cessation of calcium release from sarcoplasm
c) conformational change in Troponin T
d) Attachment of ATP to myosin head","Myosin ceases to be in contact with actin filaments as a result of the attachment of ATP to the myosin head.
Muscle contraction occurs by sliding of thin filament over thick filament. The sequence of events are as follows:
• Troponin I is bound to actin and tropomyosin and covers the sites where actin interacts with myosin heads in a resting muscle. The myosin head contains tightly bound adenosine phosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi).
• Following an action potential, cytosolic ca2+ is increased due to the ca2+ released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. simultaneously ca2+ influx happens through voltage-gated ca2+ channels too.
• The free ca2+ binds with troponin c. This binding will weaken the troponin I interaction with actin and exposes the actin-binding site for myosin.
• This results in the formation of myosin-actin cross-bridges.
• The cross-bridge between the head of the myosin and the active site of the actin causes a conformational change in the head and the power stroke occurs, moving the thin filament relative to the thick filament.
• once the head of the cross-bridge tilts, the ADP and phosphate ion that were previously attached to the head are released and a new ATP molecule can bind in that place.
• The binding of the new ATP molecule to the free site on the myosin causes detachment of the head of the myosin from the actin.
• ATP is hydrolyzed and Pi released, causing a re-cocking of the myosin head and completing the cycle.",,D,573-502.PNG
Question 5,Transport of iron into enterocytes is done by which of the following proteins:,"a) Transferrin
b) Ferroportin
c) Hepcidin
d) Divalent metal transporter - 1","Transport of iron into enterocytes is done by divalent metal transporter-1 protein.
Iron absorption occurs in the duodenum. Iron in our gut exists in 2 forms, they are nonheme and heme iron.
Luminal nonheme iron is mostly in the Fe3+ (ferric) state and is reduced to Fe2+ (ferrous) iron by ferrireductases. Fe2+ iron is then transported across the apical membrane by divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1).
Given below is an image of iron absorption that shows divalent metal transporter-1 protein in intestinal mucosal cells.
Heme iron is moved across the apical membrane into the cytoplasm through heme transporters.
In the duodenal cells, Fe2+ iron can follow one of two pathways: transport to the blood or storage as mucosal iron. The nonstorage form of Fe2+ iron is transported from the cytoplasm into circulation by the protein ferroportin (option B).
once in circulation, Fe2+ is again oxidized back to Fe3+ iron by hephaestin and ceruloplasmin. The newly absorbed Fe3+ iron binds rapidly to transferrin (option A), which delivers iron to red cell progenitors in the marrow.
Hepcidin (option C), is a protein secreted from the liver that plays a major role in the regulation of iron absorption. when the body’s iron stores are adequate, it downregulates the expression of ferroportin and thereby decreases iron absorption.",,D,573-501.PNG
Question 6,"vessel A has a length of L and diameter of D and vessel B has 2L and 2D. considering the flow is laminar through both the cylinders, the flow through B is how many times as much as the flow through A?","a) 4 times
b) 8 times
c) 16 times
d) 32 times","Flow through B will be 8 times more than the flow through A.
According to poiseuille Hagen formula,
F= Δp x π/8 x 1/n x r4/L
F = flow
Δp = pressure difference between two ends of the tube
η = viscosity
r = radius of the tube
L = length of the tube
Hence flow directly varies to the 4th power of radius and inversely varies to length.
Flow through B = (2r)4/2L = 8 times",560-495.PNG,B,
Question 7,"If the pH is reduced from 7.4 to 7.3 with the Po2 being constant at 1oo mmHg, which line would Pco2 follow?","a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4","If the pH is reduced from 7.4 to 7.3 with the alveolar po2 being constant at 1oo mmHg, pCo2 would follow line 1.
This concept can be understood in three steps.
step 1- Effect of Co2 on ventilation, when the alveolar po2 is kept constant.
when the alveolar po2 (pao2) is kept constant, an increased amount of inspired Co2 leads to increase in the ventilation. The relation is a straight line.
The below graph shows the effect of Co2 on ventilation when alveolar pao2 is kept constant at 1oomm Hg.
step 2. The shift of the above graph when Po2 changes.
when Po2 changes, the relation between the amount of Co2 inhaled and ventilation still remains in a straight line. However, the slopes of the lines change. The slope increases when alveolar Po2 decreases and vice versa. In other words, the lines move towards the left when Po2 decreases.
However, the point of intersection of all these lines remains the same.
The below graph shows the relation between inspired Co2 and ventilation when alveolar Po2 is maintained at 4omm Hg, 55mm Hg, and 1oo mm Hg. As the alveolar Po2 has decreased, the lines have shifted to the left. But they are all intersecting at the same point on the x-axis.
step 3. The shift of the above graph when pH changes.
when pH decreases, as in acidosis, the Co2 response curve is similar to the above. The only difference is they are shifted to the left and have different points on the intersection on x- axis.
The below graphs show Co2 response curves when pH is 7.4, 7.3, and Po2 is 4omm Hg, 55mm Hg, and 1oomm Hg. The lines have shifted to the left and have a different point of intersection.
In the question image, only line 1 has been shifted to the left and has a different point of intersection on x-axis compared to other lines. Therefore, line 1 is the answer.",561-496.PNG,A,575-504.PNG
Question 8,"substances and the type of transport across a membrane are given below, choose the correct combination:","a) 1 and 2 are correct
b) 1, 2, and 4 are correct
c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correct
d) 1, 2, and 5 are correct","All the given combinations 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correct.
1) oxygen is a non-polar molecule and hence can diffuse across the lipid membrane of the cells.
2) Facilitated diffusion - Transporting the molecule from one side of the cell membrane to the other is done with the help of transport proteins called carriers. Molecules move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. No energy input is required when carrier proteins move substances in the direction of their gradients. Glucose transport by the glucose transporter is an example, which moves glucose down its concentration gradient from the ECF to the cytoplasm of the cell.
3) voltage-gated channels are simple ion channels acting as transport proteins, gated by membrane potential alterations. sodium transported via voltage-gated channels is an example.
4) Transporting more than one substance together using a single transport protein against the gradient is known as secondary active transport. An example is sGLT 1, the cotransporter of sodium and glucose from the intestinal lumen into mucosal cells.
5)Active transport - Transporting of substances against the gradients, and requires energy. ca2+ ATpase that pumps out calcium out of the cells is an example.",,C,576-505.PNG
Question 9,"A and B in the graph below represent which of the following ions, in terms of permeability for action potential generation?","a) A is Na+, B is K+
b) A is Na+, B is ca2+
c) A is K+, B is ca2+
d) A is ca2+, B is K+","In the given graph, showing action potential generation in terms of ion permeability, wave A represents Na+ and B represents K+.
The sequence of events during the action potential occurs in 7 steps as described below.
1. Resting-state - Both channels are closed
2. Na+ channels open in response to depolarizing stimulus. sodium enters the cell. The membrane reaches threshold potential.
3. The sodium influx causes the opening of more Na+ channels through a positive feedback mechanism. Rapid depolarization occurs.
4. sodium conductance decreases.
5. Na+ channels close and K+ channels open. Repolarization occurs.
6. sodium channels are reset, and are ready to respond to another depolarizing stimulus (relative refractory period). During this phase, the potassium channels remain open and slowly return to closed state causing after-hyperpolarization.
7. Both channels are closed. The membrane returns to RMP.",562-497.PNG,A,578-508.PNG
Question 10,Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is used to relieve pain. what is the mechanism behind it?,"a) Gate control theory
b) conditioned pain modulation
c) Descending inhibition
d) central inhibition","Gate theory of pain is the mechanism behind transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). This method uses electrodes to activate Aα and Aβ fibres near the injury to relieve pain.
At the site of sensory afferent termination, transmission in nociceptive pathways can be interrupted. This is done by the actions within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Pain subsiding when the site of injury is rubbed or shook is an example. Afferents of innocuous cutaneous mechanoreceptors emit collaterals that terminate in the dorsal horn. The responsiveness of dorsal horn neurons to their input from nociceptive afferent terminals is reduced by these afferents This is called the gate-control mechanism of pain modulation.
The given image depicts the gate control theory of pain:",,A,579-510.PNG
Question 11,The parents notice that their child is tired and that he has shortness of breath on climbing stairs and while lying down. what is the first investigation that you would do?,"a) Echocardiogram
b) chest x-ray
c) Spirometry
d) MRI to rule out enlarged heart","The first investigation to be done for a child who feels shortness of breath on climbing stairs and in the supine position is a chest x-ray.
The child having shortness of breath on climbing stairs is known as dyspnea on exertion. The most common cause is congestive heart failure. The child feeling shortness of breath in the supine position is orthopnea. It is relieved on sitting or standing.
Respiratory causes include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism. Cardiovascular causes include congestive heart failure(CHF), pulmonary edema, valvular heart defect, and pulmonary hypertension.
Evaluation begins with assessing the airway, breathing, and circulation of the patient. Oxygen saturation can appear normal at rest, and hence oxygen saturation during physical activity should be obtained. A chest x-ray is the first diagnostic test which can show pulmonary pathology or pumonary edema and other signs of CHF that could help in identifying the cause and further evaluation.
other options:
option A: An echocardiogram can be done if the chest X-ray is abnormal. It is done to evaluate cardiac function, valvular function, and pericardial space.
option C: spirometry is done when the chest x-ray is normal. It is done to determine lung function. Abnormal spirometry can indicate either an obstructive pathology such as asthma, or CopD or a restrictive disease such as interstitial fibrosis.
option D: Cardiac MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) is an emerging modality done to look for cardiomegaly. It is for the accurate evaluation of left and right ventricular mass, size, and function. It is also used for localizing ischemic and non-ischemic causes such as myocarditis.",,B,
Question 12,Match the following molecules with their carriers in plasma:,"a) 1-b, 2-c, 3-d, 4-a
b) 1-a, 2-b, 3-c 4-d
c) 1-a, 2-d, 3-b 4-c
d) 1-b, 2-c, 3-a, 4-d","The correct pairs are as follows:
1. Thyroxine - B. pre-albumin
2. vitamin B12 - C. Transcobalamin
3. Hemoglobin - D. Haptoglobin
4. Heme - A. Hemopexin
Thyroxine is carried by thyroid-binding prealbumin, which is also known as transthyretin.
vitamin B12 binds to transcobalamin II in the ileal cells and is secreted into the plasma.
Transcobalamin II delivers vitamin B12 to the liver and other cells of the body, including rapidly proliferating cells in the bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract.
Hemopexin binds to porphyrins, particularly heme, for heme recycling.
Haptoglobin binds to free hemoglobin and prevents its excretion in urine.",,A,
Question 13,Arrange the following steps of ventricular action potential in the correct order.,"a) B, A, C, D
b) D, C, B, A
c) C, D, A, B
d) A, B, C, D","The correct sequence for ventricular action potential is as follows:
C. opening of voltage-gated sodium channels
D. Transient outward flow of potassium
A. opening of voltage-gated calcium channels
B. Repolarizing K+ currents
The events of action potential occur in the following sequence:
• phase o: voltage-gated Na+ channels open in response to depolarizing stimulus (rapid depolarization phase)
• phase 1: Inactivation of voltage-gated Na+ channels and transient outward flow of K+ causes rapid repolarization (rapid repolarization phase)
• phase 2: opening of slow voltage-gated Ca2■ channels causes the influx of calcium into the cells and results in the plateau phase (plateau phase)
• phase 3: opening of various K+ channels results in the efflux of K+ from the cells and results in slow repolarization (slow repolarization phase).
• phase 4: Return to resting membrane potential",,C,581-511.PNG
Question 14,what does the zero pressure indicate in the pressure-volume curve?,"a) Residual volume
b) Functional residual capacity
c) Tidal volume
d) Inspiratory reserve volume","The zero pressure in the pressure-volume curve indicates the functional residual capacity.
The pressure-volume relationship is basic to the understanding of the fundamental relationship between the compliance of the lungs and the chest wall. It is measured by a spirometer.
The functional residual capacity is the volume of the air that remains in the lungs after normal expiration. The normal value is about 2.5 liters.
other options:
option A: Residual volume is the air left in the lungs after a maximal expiratory effort.
option C: Tidal volume is the amount of air that moves in during each inspiration or the amount of air that moves out with each expiration, during quiet breathing. The normal tidal volume is 5oo–75o mL.
option D: Inspiratory reserve volume is the air inspired with a maximal inspiratory effort in addition to the tidal volume.",,B,
Question 15,How is cerebral perfusion pressure calculated?,"a) systolic blood pressure + Intracranial pressure
b) systolic blood pressure - intracranial pressure
c) Mean arterial pressure/intracranial pressure
d) Mean arterial pressure - intracranial pressure","Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is calculated as mean arterial pressure (MAP) - intracranial pressure (ICP).
However, ICP values are not readily available. In this case, CPP may be calculated as MAP - central venous pressure (CvP), and if CvP > ICP.
The brain depends on continuous perfusion for oxygen and glucose delivery, thus its survival. The blood flow to the brain is normally about 55 mL per 1oo g of brain tissue. If the cerebral flow reduces to less than 2o mL per minute, the brain undergoes ischemia.
Blood flow depends on cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Normally the CPP is 75-1o5 mmHg, MAP is 9o-11o mmHg and ICP is 5-15 mmHg.
According to Monro kellie doctrine, the cranium is a rigid box containing a nearly incompressible brain. In cases of head trauma, there is an expansion of cranial content, in the form of hematomas and brain swelling. This increase in cranial pressure is accommodated initially by the exclusion of fluid components, venous blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. Further increase in the cranial pressure leads to an uncontrolled rise in ICP resulting in a compromise in cerebral perfusion and eventually cerebral herniation.
Acute rise in ICP causes Cushing reflex, a triad of widened pulse pressure (increasing systolic, decreasing diastolic) bradycardia, and irregular respirations.
Thus, in cases of head injury with intracranial bleeding, cranial decompression is performed to avoid further complications due to the raised ICP.",,D,
Question 16,Fluid leaving the proximal convoluted tubule in the absence of antidiuretic hormone is:,"a) Isotonic
b) Hypotonic
c) Hypertonic
d) Depends on fluid intake","Fluid leaving the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) in the absence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is isotonic.
The PCT is the site of maximum water reabsorption under normal physiological conditions.
It reabsorbs around 6o% of the filtered NaCl and water and other nutrients such as glucose and amino acids. Isosmotic reabsorption occurs in the PCT, so the amount of solute and water reabsorbed are coupled and proportional to each other. Here, sodium is reabsorbed along with the water. The large amounts of sodium and water reabsorption are essential in maintaining the ECF volume.
In addition to the isosmotic reabsorption, the water reabsorption in the PCT also occurs through aquaporin-1 which are active water channels. Reabsorption of sodium and water in PCT is not affected by ADH levels. Thus even in the absence of ADH, fluid is isotonic in PCT.",,A,
Question 17,"2,3-BPG causes the unloading of oxygen to tissues by _________.","a) Increasing ATP production
b) Binding to beta subunit of Hb
c) Inhibiting taut structure
d) Decreasing ATP production","2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) causes the unloading of oxygen to tissues by binding to the beta subunit of Hb.
2,3 BPG is formed from glycolysis. It is found in high amounts in red blood cells and in trace amounts in most other cells. 2,3 BPG facilitates increased oxygen delivery by reducing the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen.
Hemoglobin exists in 2 forms in the blood. The deoxyhemoglobin form is called the taut or T form. This hemoglobin has a low affinity for oxygen. The oxyhemoglobin form is called the relaxed or R form. This hemoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen.
2,3 BPG binds more selectively to deoxyhemoglobin and stabilizes the taut conformation of hemoglobin (option C).
other options:
options A and D: The process of unloading oxygen by 2,3 BPG is independent of ATP production.",,B,
Question 18,The graph below shows oxygen dissociation curves. what does the curve marked as 'A' indicate?,"a) Myoglobin
b) carboxyhemoglobinemia
c) Methemoglobin
d) Fetal hemoglobin","The curve 'A' shows a hyperbolic curve that is characteristic of oxygen dissociation in myoglobin.
Myoglobin is an iron-containing component of the skeletal muscle. Myoglobin can bind only to one oxygen molecule and hence lacks co-operative binding. It has a higher affinity to oxygen than hemoglobin and hence releases oxygen only at low Po2 values. This leads to a leftward shift in the myoglobin oxygen dissociation curve.
Myoglobin is present in large quantities in muscles that are commonly used for sustained contraction. During such contractions, muscle blood supply is decreased due to compression. Myoglobin facilitates oxygen supply in these conditions.
other options:
option B: Carbon monoxide (Co) reacts with hemoglobin to form carbon monoxyhemoglobin (carboxyhemoglobin or CoHb). The affinity of hemoglobin for Co is 21o times its affinity for o2, and CoHb liberates Co very slowly. An additional difficulty is that when CoHb is present, the dissociation curve of the remaining Hbo2 shifts to the left, decreasing the amount of o2 released.
option C: Hemoglobin normally has ferrous ion. when it is oxidized to ferric iron, it is called methemoglobin. It causes dark-coloured blood.
option D: Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is structurally similar to hemoglobin A except for the gamma chains. It binds less avidly to 2,3 bisphosphoglycerate and hence has higher affinity for oxygen leading to left ward shift in the dissociation curve.",564-498.PNG,A,
Question 19,which among the following organs has the least arteriovenous oxygen difference?,"a) Brain
b) Kidney
c) skin
d) Liver","The organ with the least arteriovenous oxygen difference is the kidney.
The arteriovenous oxygen difference is the amount of oxygen the tissues take up from the blood. If the amount of oxygen utilized by the tissues is more, the greater the arteriovenous oxygen difference.
The renal cortical blood flow is comparatively greater as the main function is to filter large volumes of blood through the glomeruli. Here, the oxygen extracted from the blood is relatively less. The arteriovenous oxygen difference for the kidney is only 14 mL/L of blood, which is very less when compared to the brain and heart.
organs: Brain, Kidney, skin, Liver, Heart muscles
Arteriovenous oxygen Difference (mL/L): 62, 14, 25, 34, 114",,B,
Question 20,The image shows changes in membrane potential during an action potential. The region marked between 4 to 5 is due to ________.,"a) Influx of Na+
b) Efflux of Na+
c) Influx of K+
d) Efflux of K+","The region marked between 4 and 5 in the action potential curve indicates repolarization due to the efflux of K+ ions across the cell membrane.
The sequence of events during the action potential occurs in the following sequence.
1. Resting state: Both channels are closed.
2. Na+ channels open in response to depolarizing stimulus. sodium enters the cell. The membrane reaches threshold potential.
3. The sodium influx causes the opening of more Na+ channels through a positive feedback mechanism. Rapid depolarization occurs.
4. sodium conductance decreases.
5. Na+ channels close and K+ channels open. Due to K+ efflux, repolarization occurs.
6. Na+ channels are reset and are ready to respond to another depolarizing stimulus (relative refractory period). During this phase, the K+ channels remain open and slowly return to the closed state causing after-hyperpolarization.
7. Both channels are closed. The membrane returns to RMP.",565-499.PNG,D,578-508.PNG
Question 21,what is the value of normal tissue oncotic pressure?,"a) 12 mmHg
b) 25 mmHg
c) 32 mmHg
d) 54 mmHg","The value of normal tissue oncotic pressure is 12 mmHg. It refers to the interstitial osmotic pressure.
The interstitial oncotic pressure, while very small, is the pressure exerted by a small amount of protein present in the interstitium that tends to pull fluids out of the capillaries. It is different for each organ based on the level of protein components. It is mostly negligible, but sometimes can be as high as 6 mmHg in the brain. The values are also positive in the liver and kidneys.
The colloid osmotic pressure or oncotic pressure is the osmotic pressure exerted due to the presence of colloidal proteins like albumin and globulin within the plasma. The colloidal proteins are impermeable to the semi-permeable cell membrane and cannot cross the membrane. Thus, it exerts osmotic pressure, which pulls fluid into the capillaries.
The lowest number in the given options is 12 mmHg and, hence, is the best possible answer to this question.",,A,
Question 22,where is the signaling sequence in a type 2 membrane protein located?,"a) Inside the membrane at the N-terminal end
b) Inside the membrane at the C-terminal end
c) outside the membrane at the N-terminal end
d) outside the membrane at the C-terminal end","The signaling sequence in a type 2 membrane protein is located inside the membrane (transmembrane region).
A membrane protein can be either integral protein (spans the thickness of the cell membrane) or peripheral protein (attached to the peripheral side of the membrane).
Integral membrane proteins or transmembrane proteins are embedded in the cell membrane, spanning through the entire thickness. They are anchored by hydrophobic interactions and require the use of detergent for solubility. Examples are ligand-binding receptors for hormones or neurotransmitters, transport proteins like Na+-K+ ATPase, pores, ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and GTP-binding proteins (G proteins).
Peripheral proteins are attached only to one surface of the cell membrane and do not penetrate all the way through. They are often attached to integral proteins. Examples are cell surface receptors, enzymes, ankyrin.
signaling sequences are 16 to 3o amino acid residues in length and located at the N-terminal extension of the membrane proteins. After an appropriate trigger, they are either cleaved (and bind to MHC class I of the endoplasmic reticulum) or act as a membrane anchor (transporting proteins across the membrane).
Integral proteins can be divided into:
• Type I integral proteins have a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence (towards the cytosol).
Examples include histocompatibility antigens, glycophorin, and membrane immunoglobulin.
• Type II integral proteins have a non-cleavable N terminal combined signal/anchor sequence.
Examples include transferrin receptors and glycosyl transferases.",,A,588-513.PNG
Question 23,which of the following primary second messengers is involved in the contraction of ciliary muscles while focusing on near objects?,"a) cAMP
b) cGMP
c) Na+ inflow through a channel
d) IP3","IP3 is the primary second messenger involved in the contraction of ciliary muscles to focus on a near object.
on focusing on a near object, stimulation of the parasympathetic nerve fibers leads to the contraction of the bilateral ciliary muscle, via short ciliary nerves, which relaxes the lens ligaments. The lens becomes thicker and the increase in the refractive index allows the eye to focus on the near object. This is known as the accommodation reflex.
In the ciliary muscles of the eye, contraction is mediated via M3 > M2 receptors, while relaxation is mediated via the β2 receptor.
M3 receptors act via the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), leading to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase C, respectively. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ sets up a chain reaction which eventually leads to contraction of the ciliary smooth muscle of the eye.
Thus, in the contraction of the ciliary muscle during focusing on a near object, the second messenger involved is the IP3-DAG pathway.",,D,
Question 24,which of the following tissues are dependent on insulin for glucose uptake?,"a) Brain
b) Adipose tissue
c) Pancreas
d) Muscle","Adipose tissue is dependent on insulin for glucose uptake.
The uptake of glucose in skeletal muscles is also dependent on insulin but may be mediated via non-insulin-dependent mechanisms as well (such as muscle contractions). Therefore the best answer out of the given options is adipose tissue.
Glucose uptake by skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and adipose tissues is via GLUT-4 which is insulin-dependent. In the presence of insulin, GLUT-4 receptors translocate to the cell membrane and hence, glucose uptake by the cell occurs.
Most of the other GLUT transporters are not insulin sensitive and are constitutively expressed in the cell membrane. Ex: GLUT-1 in RBCs, brain and kidneys. (GLUT-3 is also present in the brain and kidneys)",,B,
Question 25,The second phase of saliva secretion involves:,"a) Active Na+ reabsorption, passive Cl- reabsorption, passive K+ secretion, active secretion of HCO3-
b) passive Na+ reabsorption, active Cl- reabsorption, passive K+ secretion, active secretion of HCO3-
c) passive Na+ secretion, active Cl- reabsorption, active K+ secretion, passive secretion of HCO3-
d) Active Na+ reabsorption, passive Cl- reabsorption, active K+ secretion, passive secretion of HCO3-","During the second phase of salivary secretion, Na+ is actively reabsorbed, Cl- is reabsorbed passively, K+ is secreted actively and HCO3- is secreted passively (part of the secretion may be active as well, but among the given options, option D is the most accurate with respect to all the ions).
salivary secretion occurs in two stages:
The first stage involves acini, which secrete ptyalin and/or mucin together with some ions. The composition of the ions is similar to that of the extra-cellular fluid.
The second stage involves the ducts. As the primary salivary secretion flows through the ducts, two active transport processes occur:
• Na+ is actively re-absorbed and K+ is actively secreted, in exchange for Na+.
• HCO3- is secreted by the ductal epithelium into the lumen of the salivary ducts. some of this secretion occurs by passive bicarbonate exchange for Cl- and partly active secretion.
As a result, the Na+ and Cl- concentrations are lower than that of plasma, while K+ and HCO3- concentrations are higher than that of plasma.
Composition of ions:
• Under resting conditions, the Na+ and Cl- concentrations in saliva are about 15 mEq/L each, which is 1/7th to 1/1oth of the plasma concentrations.
• K+ concentration is about 3o mEq/L, which is seven times higher than that of plasma.
• HCO3- concentration is 5o to 7o mEq/L, which is two to three times higher than that of the plasma.",,D,
Question 26,Macula densa is made of specialized cells located at:,"a) Junction of thick descending limb and DCT
b) Junction of thick descending limb and pCT
c) Junction of thick ascending limb and DCT
d) Junction of DCT and collecting duct","Macula densa are the specialized cells present at the distal end of the thick ascending loop of Henle, where it reaches the glomerulus. Distal convoluted tubule starts from macula densa.
Macula forms the part of the juxtaglomerular apparatus.
signals from the renal tubules affect filtration in its glomerulus. As the rate of flow through the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and the first part of the distal tubule increases, glomerular filtration in the same nephron decreases, and vice versa. This is known as tubuloglomerular feedback which maintains the constancy of the load delivered to the distal tubule.
The sensor is the macula densa. The Na+ and cl- in the fluid enter the macula densa cells via theNa+–K–2cl- cotransporter in their apical membranes. The increased Na+ increases the Na+-K+ ATPase activity causing ATP hydrolysis and the formation of adenosine. This acts on adenosine A1 receptors on the macula densa cells, causing the release of ca2+ into the vascular smooth muscle in the afferent arterioles, leading to vasoconstriction and decreased GFR.",nan,C,588-513.PNG
Question 27,which of the following can be used to calculate the cardiac output?,"a) A, B, C, D
b) A, D
c) B, C, D
d) A, C, D","Fick principle, thermodilution, and EcHo can be used to measure cardiac output.
cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped by the heart into the aorta every minute. The average cardiac output is 5L/min and can be measured by various indirect methods.
Fick's principle uses the total amount of oxygen absorbed from the air by the lungs and the arteriovenous oxygen difference of blood to calculate the cardiac output using the following formula:
cardiac output (L/min) 〓 (o2 absorbed per minute by the lungs (mL/min)) / (Arterio-venous o2 difference(mL/L of blood))
Thermodilution method employs cold saline which is infused into the right atrium through a double-lumen swan–Ganz thermodilution catheter and the temperature change is measured at the pulmonary artery using a thermistor at the end of the catheter. The mean decrease in the temperature of blood is inversely proportional to the cardiac output.
An EcHo uses ultrasound waves from a transducer placed on the chest wall to measure the velocity of blood flowing from the left ventricle into the aorta. stroke volume can be calculated from this. cardiac output 〓 Heart Rate X stroke volume.
The other methods that can be used to measure cardiac output include impedance cardiography a.k.a. thoracic electrical bioimpedance, electromagnetic or ultrasonic flowmeter,and indicator dilution method.
ventilation-perfusion scan is not a method of cardiac output measurement. It is used to assess pulmonary circulation.",,D,

Question 29,"consider the following statements about sympathetic, parasympathetic, and motor nerves. which of the following statements are true?","a) 1,3
b) 1,4
c) 2,3
d) 2,4","The true statements are 1,4.
Sympathetic efferents are distributed extensively all over the body whereas parasympathetic distribution is limited to head, neck, and trunk regions.
Sympathetic fibers travel short distances to the sympathetic ganglionic chain, before finally synapsing and then have a long course to supply the target organs. parasympathetic fibers travel a longer distance to their respective ganglia which are located close to the target organs.
Motor neurons are located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord from where the axons come out and divide into several branches, each of which supplies an individual muscle fiber. A motor unit comprises a motor neuron and a group of skeletal muscle fibers it innervates.",,B,
Question 30,what is the normal insensible water loss?,"a) 1oo mL/hour
b) 15o mL/hour
c) 5o mL/hour
d) 2oo mL/hour","The normal insensible water loss is 5o mL/hour.
In human beings, there is a loss of water through vaporization from the respiratory tract (3oo–4oo mL) and diffusion from the skin (3oo–4oo mL). This is called insensible water loss. It is about 5o mL/hour. This insensible water loss via the skin is independent of sweating and occurs in people without sweat glands as well.",,C,
Question 31,A woman has vomiting whenever she eats spicy food. Arrange the sequence of events during vomiting.,"a) 6, 4, 2, 5, 1, 3
b) 6, 4, 2, 3, 1, 5
c) 4, 6, 2, 1, 3, 5
d) 4, 6, 2, 5, 3, 1","The correct sequence of vomiting is 6, 4, 2, 3, 1, 5.
6. Reverse peristalsis in the small intestine.
4. Relaxation of the pyloric sphincter.
2. Strong contractions in the stomach.
3. Inspiration against a closed glottis.
1. LES is open and UES is closed.
5. LES opens and UES opens.
The sensory signals that initiate vomiting are located in the pharynx, esophagus, stomach, and upper portions ofthe small intestines. Excessive distention or irritation of the duodenum provides a strong stimulus for vomiting. Area postrema constitutes the vomiting centre.
In the early stage, reverse peristalsis begins often minutes before vomiting. It begins far down in the ileum and travels up the intestine. This process pushes a large share of lower small intestine contents to the duodenum and stomach. Relaxation of the pyloric sphincter occurs during this process.
At the onset of vomiting, strong intrinsic contractions are seen in the duodenum and stomach. once the vomiting centre has been stimulated, inspiration occurs against the closed glottis. It prevents the flow of vomitus into the lungs. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is open and the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) is closed at this stage.
The muscles of the abdominal wall contract, building intra-gastric pressure. Finally LES relaxes completely and UES also relaxes allowing the expulsion of the gastric contents.
Note: The esophageal smooth muscle functions as LES at the gastro-esophageal junction. It normally remains tonically constricted. Receptive relaxation of LES occurs when the peristaltic wave passes down the esophagus.",,B,
