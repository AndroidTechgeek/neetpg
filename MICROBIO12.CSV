Q1,"A patient hailing from Delhi presents with fever, arthralgia, and extensive petechial rash for 3 days. Lab investigations revealed a hemoglobin of 9 g/dL, a white blood cell count of 9ooo
cells/mm3, a platelet count of 2oooo cells/mm3, and a prolonged bleeding time. The clotting time was normal. what is the most likely diagnosis?","a)Dengue
b)Malaria
c)scrub typhus
d)Typhoid","The given clinical vignette is suggestive of dengue fever.
Dengue is an acute febrile disease caused by the mosquito-borne dengue viruses (DENVs),
consisting of four serotypes (DENV 1 to 4), that are members of the Flaviviridae family, genus Flavivirus.
Dengue virus is transmitted from person to person by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
After an incubation period of 3–15 days, classical dengue fever begins with an abrupt onset of high fever. The condition is self-limiting though debilitating with headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, petechiae rash, and leucopenia. A macular-papular recovery rash appears 3–4 days
after the onset of fever, and it usually starts on the trunk before spreading peripherally. The rash in dengue appears as 'white islands in a red sea' due to erythema with petechiae.
shown below is an image of the rash in dengue:",,A,1654-1053.PNG;1583-1001.PNG
Q2,which of the following statements is true about Trichomonas vaginalis?,"a)It cannot be cultured
b)Twitching motility is seen on wet saline mount
c)cysts are seen on wet saline mount of vaginal secretions
d)It is not a sexually transmitted infection","Trichomonas vaginalis has a jerky or twitching type of mobility on the wet saline mount. option B is the correct answer.
T. vaginalis is the only protozoan with one stage in its life cycle, i.e., trophozoite form (no cyst
stage is seen). It is an obligate parasite and cannot live without close association with vaginal,
urethral, or prostatic tissues. sexual transmission is the main route of infection. other modes are fomites, and babies during passage through the infected birth canal.
The incubation period ranges from 4 days to 4 weeks.
The common presentation of trichomoniasis is foul-smelling frothy vaginal discharge, itching, dysuria, and dyspareunia. petechial hemorrhage and mucosal capillary dilation give the
appearance of a strawberry cervix. chicken-like epithelium occurs due to intracellular edema



which is also a characteristic feature.
The gold standard for diagnosis is culture on cysteine-peptone-liver-maltose (CPLM) medium or plastic envelope medium (PEM). The treatment of choice is metronidazole 2 g orally as a single   dose.
T. vaginalis infection in women may lead to infertility, preterm birth, and low-birth-weight
infants. In men, trichomoniasis has been also associated with infertility through inflammatory damage to the genitourinary tract or interference with sperm function.

Q3,"A lady from west Rajasthan presented with an ulcer surrounded by erythema on the right leg. Microscopy of the biopsy from the edge of the ulcer showed organisms with dark staining
nuclei and kinetoplast. what is the most likely causative agent?","a)Leishmania tropica
b)Babesia
c)Trypanosoma
d)Histoplasma","The above clinical vignette is suggestive of cutaneous leishmaniasis.
Leishmaniasis is a slowly progressing indigenous disease caused by a protozoan parasite of the
genus Leishmania. It is transmitted by the bite of an infected female Phlebotomus sandfly which    inoculates the flagellated promastigotes into the skin of the host in developing countries. In India, it is endemic to Bihar, west Bengal, Jharkhand, and uttar Pradesh.
Causative organisms include:
• old world leishmaniasis: Leishmania donovani, Leishmania major, and Leishmania tropica
• New world leishmaniasis: Leishmania mexicana complex and Leishmania braziliensis complex The image given below shows a phlebotomus sandfly.





The image given below shows chiclero ulcer/New world cutaneous leishmaniasis.


The image below shows Lutzomyia sandfly responsible for the New world cutaneous leishmanisis.





In human beings, the disease presents in four different forms with a broad range of clinical manifestations:
• visceral leishmaniasis, or kala-azar, • cutaneous leishmaniasis,
• Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, and
• Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis.
The life cycle of Leishmania involves two forms:
• The promastigote which develops and lives extracellularly in the sandfly vector and
• The amastigote multiplies intracellularly in the reticuloendothelial cells of the host.
when the infected sandfly bites a person, infectious promastigotes are released into the host
dermis along with the sandfly saliva, which potentiates parasite infectivity. Amastigote form (as shown in the image below) is also known as Leishman-Donovan (LD) body. It is an intracellular form found inside macrophages, monocytes, and reticuloendothelial cells. It contains a
kinetoplast, which consists of a parabasal body and a blepharoplast. Flagellum is absent.





promastigote form (as shown in the below image) is present in the midgut of the female sandfly. The kinetoplast lies transversely near the anterior end. A single flagellum is seen. It is the
infective form of L. donovani for humans.


Given below is the lifecycle of L. donovanii.





This condition causes fever with rigor and chills associated with splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. It lowers immunity, causes persistent fever, anemia, and liver and spleen enlargement, and if left  untreated, death may occur due to opportunistic infection.
Diagnosis of kala-azar is mainly by demonstration of amastigotes within macrophages in tissue aspirates such as blood smears, bone marrow, splenic, or lymph node aspirate. It is the gold
standard for diagnosis.
The image below shows amastigotes located intracellularly within macrophages.


Tests to detect leishmaniasis include:
• Rapid diagnostic test: rk39 Rapid diagnostic test and kala-azar dipstick test strip. This is recommended by National Vector Borne Disease Control programme (NVBDCp) in India.
• parasitological diagnosis: Demonstration of LD bodies in buffy coat smear - confirmatory.
• Aldehyde test of Napier: widely used for surveillance.



• Serological tests for diagnosis: Rapid dipstick test, Direct agglutination test, ELISA, indirect fluorescent antibody test
• Leishmanin (Montenegro) test: Induration of 5mm or more is considered positive, usually
positive 4-6 weeks (delayed-hypersensitivity) after onset in cutaneous leishmaniasis, valuable for distinguishing immune from nonimmune subjects and endemicity.
Drugs used in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis are
• Sodium stibogluconate
• Miltefosine
• Amphotericin B
In Bihar, there is resistance to antimony so amphotericin-B-deoxycholate or miltefosine is preferred.
other options:
option B: Babesia is a protozoan parasite that causes babesiosis, a tick-borne disease. Babesiosis manifests as a malaria-like illness with fever, chills, and hemolytic anemia.
option C: Trypanosoma is a genus of protozoan parasites responsible for diseases like African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease). These
diseases present with different clinical features, such as fever, swollen lymph nodes, and
neurological symptoms in African trypanosomiasis, and fever, swelling at the infection site, and cardiomyopathy in Chagas disease.
option D: Histoplasma is a dimorphic fungus that causes histoplasmosis, a systemic mycosis. It primarily affects the lungs and can disseminate to other organs in immunocompromised
individuals. The clinical presentation of histoplasmosis is variable, but it does not typically present as a skin ulcer with erythema as described in the clinical scenario.",,A,1656-1056.PNG;1656-1055.PNG;1657-1057.PNG;1658-1059.PNG;1658-1058.PNG
Q4,A child presents with a fever and a rash. urine examination showed cells with owl's eye appearance. what is the most likely diagnosis?,"a)cytomegalovirus
b)Epstein-Barr virus
c)Herpes simplex virus
d)Toxoplasma gondii","The most likely causative agent is cytomegalovirus (CMV) based on the clinical symptoms and the presence of the owl's eye appearance on urinary examination.
CMV is the largest virus in the herpes family of viruses. It causes the following conditions:
• Immunocompetent individuals - asymptomatic or mononucleosis-like infection such as fever and rash
• Neonates - devastating systemic infections
• Immunosuppressed individuals - serious, life-threatening, disseminated CMV infections of the lungs (pneumonitis) and gastrointestinal tract (colitis)
CMV spreads through contact with salivary secretions and sexual contact, blood transfusion, and organ transplantation.
Laboratory diagnosis is by recovery of the virus from urine, saliva, or other bodily fluids into  human fibroblast cells. Antibody demonstration using ELISA is used for diagnosis of primary infection.



A cytomegalic pneumocyte containing characteristic intranuclear basophilic inclusion surrounded by a clear halo known as an owl’s eye appearance.
other options:
option B: Epstein Barr virus: conditions associated with EBV infection are
• Glandular fever (infectious mononucleosis): fever, pharyngitis, and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy
• Hodgkin lymphoma
• Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
• Burkitt's lymphoma
• Nasopharyngeal carcinoma
• EBV■associated lymphoproliferative disease
option c: Herpes simplex virus causes cutaneous infections like herpes labialis caused by viral reactivation in febrile patients. It presents as blisters around the mouth, cheeks, and forehead. Gingivostomatitis and pharyngitis are the most frequent manifestations of primary herpes
infections. HSV esophagitis presents as dysphagia, sub-sternal pain, and weight loss.
option D: Acute congenital toxoplasmosis may manifest as fever, jaundice, petechial rashes, microphthalmia, cataract, glaucoma, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, myocarditis,   cerebral calcifications, and chorioretinitis.
Most infections in adults who are immunocompetent are usually asymptomatic. Active progression of infection is more likely in immunocompromised individuals.",,A,1661-1060.PNG
Q5,Infection with clonorchis sinensis is associated with an increased risk of____________.,"a)cervical cancer
b)cholangiocarcinoma
c)Gastric carcinoma
d)Bladder carcinoma","clonorchis sinensis or chinese liver fluke causes clonorchiasis. It is also associated with an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma.



clonorchis sinensis infection is endemic in south china, Japan, korea, and Taiwan due to a long tradition of consuming raw freshwater fish or shellfish. Humans are infected by eating raw or
undercooked fish containing encysted larvae (metacercariae).
The immature flukes after excystation in the duodenum enter the biliary ducts and differentiate into adults.
The hermaphroditic adults produce eggs that are excreted in the feces. upon reaching freshwater the eggs are ingested by snails, which are the first intermediate hosts. The eggs hatch within the   gut and differentiate first into larvae (rediae) and then into many free-swimming cercariae.
cercariae encyst to form metacercariae under the scales of certain freshwater fish (second intermediate host) which are then ingested by humans.
In humans, it infects the common bile duct and gallbladder. Liver imaging shows a dilated biliary tract. It is a risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma.
The life cycle of clonorchis sinensis is given below:


other options:
option A: cervical cancer - Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, particularly with high-risk  strains like HPV-16 and 18, is the main risk factor for cervical cancer. clonorchis sinensis is not associated with cervical cancer.
option c: Gastric carcinoma - Helicobacter pylori infection is a major risk factor for the   development of gastric carcinoma. clonorchis sinensis is not linked to gastric carcinoma.
option D: Bladder carcinoma - The vesical blood fluke schistosoma haematobium primarily  infects the urinary bladder and increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder. clonorchis sinensis is not associated with bladder carcinoma.",,B,1662-1061.PNG
Q6,"A patient presented with complaints of persistent cough and weight loss. He had a history of  contact with multiple sexual partners. He was diagnosed as HIV positive 6 months back and   is poorly adherent to his medications. The fungal culture of sputum was negative. on Gomori methamine silver staining, the cells showed darkly stained crescent-shaped cysts. what is the most likely causative organism?","a)paracoccidiodes brasiliensis
b)Histoplasma capsulatum
c)coccidiodes immitis
d)pneumocystis jerovecii","The given clinical vignette is suggestive of pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii.



p. jirovecii pneumonia (pCp) is an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. It  usually occurs when the CD4 count falls below 2oo cells/μL. patients usually present with fever and nonproductive cough with progressive shortness of breath. It can also affect other organs    like lymph nodes, spleen, and liver.
Laboratory and radiographic findings are also non-specific and show an increase in lactate
dehydrogenase levels and symmetric, perihilar, and diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates,
respectively. The classic radiographic appearance of symptomatic pneumocystis pneumonia
consists of diffuse bilateral symmetric interstitial infiltrates that are perihilar. CT will show
diffuse ground-glass opacities. Giemsa stain, toluidine blue, methenamine silver, and calcofluor  white stains demonstrate trophozoites. The cyst wall appears black with Gomori's methenamine silver stain.
shown below is an image of the staining showing the black-stained crescent-shaped cysts
resembling the crushed ping-pong balls of p. jirovecii. The stain used for staining the causative organism is Gomori’s methenamine silver stain.


Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination (commonly known as co-trimoxazole) is the
treatment of choice for pCp, and it is administered for 21 days, followed by a course for secondary prophylaxis. Concomitantly, glucocorticoids should also be administered to reduce pulmonary
inflammation.
patients who are susceptible to pCp are also given co-trimoxazole as prophylaxis. For patients who are unable to tolerate co-trimoxazole, IV pentamidine is the drug of choice.
prophylaxis is indicated for other opportunistic infections like Mycobacterium avium complex
(MAC) infection if CD4 counts fall below 5o cells/μL; Coccidioides, if CD count is &lt;25o/μL; and Cryptococcus, when the CD count is &lt;1oo/μL.
other options:
option A: paracoccidioides brasiliensis causes paracoccidioidomycosis, which usually presents   with ulcerations in the oral and nasal mucosa, lymphadenopathy, and pulmonary lesions, but it does not form crescent-shaped cysts.



option B: Histoplasma capsulatum causes histoplasmosis and may be associated with similar symptoms as pneumocystis jirovecii, but it does not show crescent-shaped cysts on Gomori     methenamine silver staining.
option c: coccidioides immitis causes coccidioidomycosis, which is characterized by respiratory symptoms, skin lesions, and joint pain. It also does not show crescent-shaped cysts on Gomori    methenamine silver staining.",,D,1663-1062.PNG
Q7,"A sewage worker presented with abdominal pain, jaundice, conjunctival suffusion, and blood in the urine for the past 5 days. which of the following is the investigation of choice?","a)widal test
b)Microscopic agglutination test
c)weil-Felix reaction
d)paul-Bunnell test","The given clinical scenario is suggestive of leptospirosis (weil's disease). A microscopic agglutination test is the investigation of choice for the diagnosis of leptospirosis.
Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Leptospira interrogans. Humans are infected when the leptospirae in water contaminated with the urine of carrier animals enter the body through    cuts or abrasions on the skin or through the intact mucosa of the mouth, nose, or conjunctiva.    Hence, a sewage worker is at an increased risk of it.
clinical features include fever, jaundice, vomiting, headache, and intense injection of the eyes.   some may present as aseptic meningitis or with hepatorenal damage (weil's disease). There are two clinical types of leptospirosis: icteric and non-icteric. It can also manifest as aseptic
meningitis.
The life cycle of Leptospira is depicted below:",,B,1644-1051.PNG
Q8,which of the following laboratory test is used to diagnose rotavirus diarrhea?,"a)Antigen detection in the stool sample
b)Antigen detection in blood
c)Antibody detection in serum
d)Light microscopy of stool specimen","Antigen detection in the stool sample is the laboratory test used to detect rotavirus diarrhea.
Rotavirus is the most common identifiable viral cause of diarrhea in children below the age of 5  years and is most frequent between 6-24 months of age. The incubation period is 1-3 days. Most



cases are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms like watery diarrhea, vomiting, low-grade fever, and temporary lactose intolerance.
Diagnosis can be made by rapid antigen detection of rotavirus in stool specimens. Laboratory
diagnosis depends on the demonstration of the virus in stool samples which is collected at an
earlier course of illness. Antigen enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) are used to detect the virus in the stool. The polymerase chain reaction is the most sensitive detection method for genotyping of rotavirus nucleic acids from stool specimens.
Treatment is supportive including the correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance. The main   goals of treatment are avoiding and treating dehydration. Maintaining nutrition is a secondary goal.",,A,
Q9,A boy presented with a fever and chills. Rapid test was positive for specific antigen HRp-2. which of the following species of plasmodium is the most likely causative agent?,"a)plasmodium falciparum
b)plasmodium malariae
c)plasmodium vivax
d)plasmodium ovale","The given clinical scenario and the HRP-2 positivity are suggestive of P. falciparum malaria.
Malaria is a parasitic infection caused by the Plasmodium species transmitted by
the Anopheles mosquito. It is characterized by many nonspecific symptoms, including but not     limited to tachycardia, tachypnea, chills, malaise, fatigue, diaphoresis (sweating), and headache.
The fever of malaria is characterized by periodicity depending on the infective Plasmodium
species. The fever returns every other day for P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. falciparum, and every three days for P. malariae.
The newer tests include rapid antigen detection tests that employ immunochromatographic
methods. The parasite-F test is one of them. This test is based on the detection of histidine-rich  protein-2 (HRP-2) which is produced only by the asexual forms of Plasmodium falciparum that  are present on the surface of RBCs. The test strip has monoclonal antibodies against the HRP-2 antigen. This test has very high sensitivity and specificity. The disadvantages of the test include  that it can detect only Plasmodium falciparum HRP-2 antigen but not the other three species of Plasmodium. Also, the test remains positive until 2 weeks after the cure.
Another diagnostic test of significance is the dual antigen test. This test detects both the parasite  lactate dehydrogenase of trophozoites and gametocytes of all the Plasmodium species and HRP-2 produced by P. falciparum simultaneously.",,A,
Q10,"A child was brought with complaints of high fever, multiple seizures, headache, and neck rigidity. CSF analysis showed low glucose, high protein, and many polymorphs. The CSF  culture showed pleomorphic gram-negative bacilli. what is true about the causative
organism?","a)It is bacitracin sensitive.
b)produces non-lactose fermenting colonies on MacConkey agar
c)Exhibits satellitism around Staphylococcus aureus colonies
d)It exhibits alpha hemolysis on sheep blood agar","This clinical vignette is suggestive of meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae. H. influenzae is a gram-negative pleomorphic bacillus that is non-motile and non-spore-forming. The correct
statement about this causative organism is that it exhibits satellitism around Staphylococcus colonies, i.e option C.
when present in the sputum, H. influenzae appears as a coccobacillus, but in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), it appears as a filamentous bacillus.
H. influenzae requires growth factors V and X that are present in the blood.
• Factor V  is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a coenzyme, and is heat labile.



• Factor X is hemin. It is required for cytochrome synthesis and the function of enzymes like catalase and peroxidase. It is heat stable.
when H. influenzae is cultured on the same plate as Staphylococcus aureus. The colonies of H.   influenzae that are closer to S. aureus, have larger growth. This is termed satellitism (option c). This occurs because factor V is released by the hemolytic action of S. aureus.
The image below shows satellitism.



H. influenzae has a capsular polysaccharide, which is a major antigenic determinant. capsular typing is done to identify strains. Importantly, the type b capsular polysaccharide has a
polyribosyl ribitol phosphate (PRP) antigen. PRP is targeted during immunization.
H. influenzae can also cause meningitis, laryngo-epiglottitis, pneumonia, bronchitis, and suppurative lesions like arthritis, endocarditis, and pericarditis.
cefotaxime or ceftazidime is the drug of choice for the treatment of Haemophilus meningitis. H. influenzae produces beta-lactamase, hence resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics like ampicillin.",,C,1666-1064.PNG;1666-1063.PNG
Q11,"A patient presented with a high fever, altered sensorium, headache, neck rigidity, and
seizures. He was diagnosed with HSV encephalitis. which of the following tests can be used



to confirm the diagnosis?","a)IgM in CSF
b)Tzanck smear of CSF
c)CSF PCR for viral DNA
d)CSF culture on chick embryo lines","HSV-DNA demonstration in CSF by PCR is the investigation of choice for HSV encephalitis.
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis is defined as inflammation of brain parenchyma caused by the herpes virus, and it typically presents as an acute febrile illness.
Patients typically present with acute onset of fever, altered levels of consciousness, personality
changes, and evidence of either focal or diffuse neurologic signs and symptoms, especially in the   temporal lobe. Focal or generalized seizures occur in many patients with HSV encephalitis. other most commonly encountered focal findings include aphasia, ataxia, upper motor neuron or lower motor neuron type lesions, and cranial nerve deficits.
HSV-DNA demonstration in CSF by PCR is the investigation of choice for HSV encephalitis. other investigations that can help include CSF examination, CSF culture, serological studies, MRI, CT,    EEG, and brain biopsy.
The T2-weighted MRI of the brain will show hyperintensity in the temporal lobe in most of the patients. Bilateral involvement of the temporal lobe is more common in HSV encephalitis.
The image below is a coronal T2-weighted MR image showing a high signal intensity in the temporal lobes in a patient with HSV encephalitis.


Management includes supportive therapy (monitoring of intracranial pressure, fluid restriction, avoidance of hypotonic IV fluids), anticonvulsants for seizures, and intravenous acyclovir is
beneficial in the treatment of HSV encephalitis.
other options:
option A: IgM antibodies in CSF - Serological tests to detect antibodies are used for primary herpes infections.
option B: Tzanck smear of CSF - A positive smear shows multinucleated giant cells with faceted nuclei and ground glass appearance. It is a rapid, inexpensive, and fairly sensitive diagnostic



test. The Tzanck smear is typically used to diagnose cutaneous herpes infections, such as herpes     simplex or varicella-zoster virus. It is not an appropriate diagnostic test for HSV encephalitis, as it does not provide definitive confirmation of the presence of HSV in the CSF.
option D: CSF culture in chick embryos - It is not a sensitive test used for the diagnosis of HSV    encephalitis. Negative CSF viral cultures have no value in ruling out HSV encephalitis. Although   this method can be used to isolate HSV, it is not as sensitive or specific as PCR for viral DNA and it can take a longer time to obtain results.",,C,1667-1065.PNG
Q12,"In a patient presented with a fever and a positive filarial antigen test, what is the next appropriate method of management?","a)Bone marrow biopsy
b)DEC provocation test
c)Detection of microfilariae in the blood smear
d)ultrasound of the scrotum","A patient with fever and filarial antigen test positive is suggestive of filariasis. The next most appropriate step for this patient is the detection of microfilariae in the blood smear.
Classical filariasis occurs due to the obstruction of lymphatics by the adult worms, which results in lymph stasis. The disease initially causes acute attacks of lymphangitis and lymphadenitis. As time goes by the lymphedema worsens and is associated with the thickening of the skin and
fibrosis of lymph vessels or blockage by adult worms. The lymphatic vessels of the male genitalia  are most commonly affected in bancroftian filariasis, producing episodic funiculitis, epididymitis, and orchitis. Hydrocele or elephantiasis is a very common sign of chronic bancroftian filariasis.
The standard method for diagnosing active infection is the identification of microfilariae in a
blood smear by microscopic examination. The microfilariae that cause lymphatic filariasis
circulate in the blood at night showing a nocturnal periodicity. Microfilariae can be detected in
blood smears of samples obtained at night between 1o PM to 2 AM. A thick smear should be made and stained with Giemsa or hematoxylin and eosin. For increased sensitivity, concentration
techniques like membrane filter concentration can be used.
DEC provocation test (option B) refers to the administration of Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) at a dose of 1oo mg or 2 mg/kg body weight orally and subsequently collecting blood samples. This  causes the mobilization of microfilariae into the peripheral blood and thus microfilariae can be detected 2o-5o minutes after the DEC administration in the sample of peripheral blood.
Although the DEC provocation test has the advantage of blood sample collection even during day time, the guidelines from CDC, NVBDCP, and IAPSM suggest blood sample collection at night,    followed by identification of microfilariae in a blood smear by microscopic examination as the
standard method for diagnosis (option C).
Methods to detect adult worms include:
• Lymph node biopsy to detect adult worms. Bone marrow biopsy is not a standard diagnostic   procedure for filariasis, as adult worms typically reside in the lymphatic system rather than the bone marrow (option A).
• X-ray (if worms are calcified)
• High-frequency ultrasound and doppler of the scrotum (option D).
Serologic techniques provide an alternative to the microscopic detection of microfilariae for the
diagnosis of lymphatic filariasis. Patients with active filarial infection typically have elevated levels of anti-filarial IgG4 in the blood and these can be detected using routine assays.



• Antigen detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELIsA) and immunochromatographic test (ICT)
• Antibody detection tests have low sensitivity and specificity
• Molecular diagnosis is done by PCR (polymerase chain reaction). This test is positive only when microfilaria are present in peripheral blood. It is negative in chronic filariasis.
Diethylcarbamazine is the drug of choice. WHO has recently recommended
a triple-drug combination of ivermectin, DEC, and albendazole as a faster and more effective alternative to expedite the elimination of filariasis.",,C,1565-981.PNG
Q13,A man presents with a history of dysuria and urethral discharge after having unprotected   sexual intercourse. Gram-staining of the purulent discharge is seen in the following image. what is the treatment of choice for this infection?,"a)Erythromycin
b)Azithromycin
c)ceftriaxone
d)penicillin G","This clinical scenario along with the microscopic findings of gram■negative intracellular   diplococci indicates infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The treatment of choice for the infection is ceftriaxone.
Gonorrhea is a disease acquired by sexual contact. The first step in infection is the adhesion of
gonococci to the urethra or other mucosal surfaces. The incubation period is 2-8 days. The major symptoms include purulent urethral discharge and dysuria.
In males, the disease starts as acute urethritis presenting with purulent discharge. The patients   may also have penile lymphangitis when the soft tissue inflammation is extensive. This infection may extend along the urethra to involve the prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymis.
In females, the initial infection involves the cervix uteri and urethra which may extend to
Bartholin glands, endometrium, and fallopian tubes. Pelvic inflammatory disease and salpingitis may lead to sterility. Rarely peritonitis may develop with perihepatic
inflammation (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome).
The discharge is collected and subjected to Gram stain, revealing gram■negative intracellular diplococci within phagocytes. stuart's transport medium is used. Cultures can be obtained
from chocolate agar or Mueller-Hinton agar. specifically, Thayer-Martin agar is used to



isolate N. gonorrhoeae.
Single-agent therapy with ceftriaxone is preferred for the treatment of gonococcal infections. According to CDC guidelines (2o21), treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections is as  follows:
• weight &lt;15o kg – Ceftriaxone 5oo mg intramuscular (IM) in a single dose
• weight ≥15o kg – Ceftriaxone 1 g IM in a single dose
The doses of ceftriaxone are higher than the previous guidelines as the gonococcal minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are rising worldwide. The British BASHH guidelines also     recommend a high dose of 1g.
Concurrent chlamydial infection must also be treated unless it has been excluded by molecular testing.
First-line drug administered is
• oral doxycycline 1oo mg BD for 7 days partner treatment is also required.
other options:
option A: Erythromycin: This is not the preferred treatment for gonorrhea, as it is less effective and has a higher rate of resistance compared to ceftriaxone.
option B: Azithromycin: Although it can be used in combination with ceftriaxone for the treatment of gonorrhea, it is not the treatment of choice as a single agent.
option D: penicillin G: This was once a treatment option for gonorrhea, but it is no longer recommended due to widespread resistance.",1652-1052.PNG,C,
