• Mitochondria appear as round or elliptical bodies of o.5-2.o micron long on an electron microscope, consisting of an outer and an inner mitochondrial membrane, cristae, and mitochondrial matrix.
• Golgi bodies (or Golgi apparatus) appear as stacks of flatenned membranous cisternae surrounded by clusters of vesicles.
• Ribosomes may be attached to the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (as shown in the image below), or else, they may exist as monosomes or as a chain of granular structures called polyribosomes associated with mRNA.",44.PNG,C,54.PNG

Q22,Meissner corpuscles are present in:,"a) papillary dermis
b) Reticular dermis
c) Basal epidermis
d) stratum lucidum","Meissner corpuscles are present in the papillary dermis.
