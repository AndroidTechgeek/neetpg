Q1,All of the following are true about oculomotor nerve palsy except _____.,"a)ptosis
b)Mid-dilated pupil
c)Loss of light reflex
d)Lateral and upward gaze","Lateral and upward gaze is a sign of trochlear (4th) nerve palsy and not of oculomotor palsy. oculomotor (3rd) nerve palsy leads to lateral and downward gaze.
3rd cranial nerve palsy presents with
• Ptosis(option A) due to weakness of levator palpebrae superioris muscle (LPS)
• Abduction and depression in the primary position (""down and out"") due to unopposed action of the lateral rectus (6th nerve supply)  and superior oblique muscles (4th nerve supply)
• Dilated pupil(option B), loss of light reflex(option c) and defective accommodation due to parasympathetic palsy (involvement of Edinger westphal parasympathetic supply)
• Limited adduction, elevation and depression due to ipsilateral paralysis of medial rectus, inferior oblique and inferior rectus .


4th cranial nerve palsy presents with superior oblique muscle paralysis.
clinical findings of trochlear nerve palsy include:
• Hypertropia (elevation) in the primary position
• Extorsion that is greatest in abduction
• compensatory head posture with contralateral face turn and head tilt with chin slightly depressed. This position is assumed to avoid Diplopia.
• Limitation of depression
• Normal abduction and elevation

Q2,The center for vertical gaze is ________,"a)pontine paramedian Reticular Formation
b)Raphe Nuclues
c)Rostral Interstitial Nucleus of cajal
d)Nucleus of perlia","The Rostral Interstitial Nucleus of cajal is the center for vertical gaze.
vertical eye movement initiation in the frontal lobes is mediated by the impulses generated via the vertical gaze center called Rostral interstitial Nucleus of cajal. This nucleus is a prominent group   of cells present within the Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus (MLF) in the midbrain.
Pontine Paramedian Reticular Formation(option A) is the center for horizontal gaze. classically, initiation occurs in the premotor cortex frontal eye fields from where impulses for horizontal
movement pass to the contralateral paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF).
Both horizontal and vertical gaze are saccadic types of conjugate eye movements. conjugate eye movements, also known as versions, are binocular movements in which the eyes move
synchronously in the same direction.",,C,2941-1779.PNG
Q3,You can use a stenopaeic slit for all of the following except ____________.,"a)Fincham’s test
b)corneal tattooing
c)Optical Iridectomy
d)To find out the axis in astigmatism","stenopaeic slit is not used for corneal tattooing.
stenopaeic slit is an ophthalmological instrument that is used in:
• Fincham’s test (option A) : This test is used to differentiate between the colored halos due to immature cataract and corneal abnormalities such as corneal edema due to glaucoma.
• To find out the axis in astigmatism (option D) for prescribing the correction glasses.
• To find out the optimal site for optical iridectomy (option c) for treating cases of central macular or leucomatous corneal opacities.
corneal tattooing was done mainly in the past for cosmetic purposes. It is commonly done for firm scars of corneal opacities in a eye without any useful vision.

Q4,A 55-year-old male patient came to OpD with the complaints of glare during night drives. He  had undergone cataract surgery 1 year back. The best-corrected visual acuity is RE = 6/12 and LE = 6/9. No improvement with pinhole. what is the probable diagnosis?,"a)cystoid macular edema
b)pseudophakic bullous keratopathy
c)ARMD
d)posterior capsular opacification","The given clinical picture of a post cataract surgery patient coming with symptoms of glare and
reduced visual acuity which doesn't improve on pinhole testing is suggestive of posterior capsular opacification (pco).
pinhole testing is done to differentiate between the various causes of reduced visual acuity.on
pinhole testing if the visual acuity remains the same or worsens it is suggestive of either a macular disease or posterior capsular opacification.
posterior capsular opacification also known as secondary cataract or After cataract is a late postoperative complication that follows extracapsular extraction of the lens.



Different types of after cataract include:
• Elschnig’s pearls: where the subcapsular epithelial cells proliferate and develop into vacuolated soap bubble like clusters along the posterior capsule
• soemmering’s ring: A peripheral dense ring is formed behind the iris and is enclosed between layers of the capsule.
• Dense membranous after cataract: formed in the pupillary area impairing the vision.
• Thin membranous after cataract (thickened posterior capsule) Treatment of after cataract is by:
• Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy of the posterior capsule whose principle is photodisruption.
• surgical posterior capsulotomy.


The below given image is of Elschnig’s pearls type of after catarct.




option A: Cystoid Macular edema (CME) is a collection of fluid between the outer plexiform layer and the inner nuclear layer of the retina following a break in the blood-retina barrier.

Q7,what is the adjuvant therapy in fungal corneal ulcer?,"a)pilocarpine e/d
b)Lignocaine e/d
c)Dexamethasone e/d
d)Atropine sulfate eye ointment","Atropine sulfate (1%) eye ointment or eye drops is used as the nonspecific supportive treatment in both bacterial as well as a fungal corneal ulcer.
Atropine sulphate (1%) is a cycloplegic drug that is used as an adjunct in the treatment of corneal ulcers to
• reduce pain from ciliary spasm
• prevent posterior synechiae formation that can develop from secondary iridocyclitis
• Increase blood supply to the anterior chamber that gets more antibodies into aqueous humor
• Reduce exudation by decreasing hyperpermeability of the vessels
Another cycloplegic that can be used as an adjunct is homatropine 2%.
Topical steroids such as Dexamethasone(option C) will increase fungal replication and corneal invasion and hence are contraindicated in the treatment of fungal corneal ulcers.
Management of fungal corneal ulcer includes
Definitive treatment:
• Topical antifungal eye drops: used for 6-8 weeks
• Filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus and Fusarium- Drug of choice (DOC) is natamycin (5%).
Others include amphotericin B (o.1-o.3%), fluconazole (o.2%) or voriconazole 1o%.
• yeast such as Candida- Drug of choice (DOC) is Amphotericin B. Others include Nystatin 3.5%.
• Intracameral or intracorneal administration of voriconazole in cases with intraocular extension or anterior chamber involvement.
• systemic antifungals such as tablet fluconazole are given in severe cases of deeper fungal keratitis.



• Therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty for unresponsive cases.
Adjunct therapy:
• cycloplegics : Atropine sulphate 1% or homatropine 2%
• systemic analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs such as paracetamol, ibuprofen to decrease pain and edema.
• vitamins A,B-complex,c- to aid healing of the ulcer.
• Hot fomentation, dark goggles, rest, good diet.",,D,
Q8,All are ocular manifestations of dengue except ________.,"a)cataract
b)subconjunctival hemorrhage
c)uveitis
d)Retinal hemorrhage","cataract is not an ocular manifestation of dengue.
Dengue has varied manifestations, in different organ systems, mainly of inflammation and
bleeding. The mechanisms for ocular manifestations in dengue include a direct viral effect on the eye, an immune-mediated vasculitis, and a variety of secondary effects related to dengue-induced vascular leakage and hemostatic abnormalities.
ocular manifestations of dengue are:
• visual impairment which can be either painless or painful
• Retro orbital pain
• conjunctival injection and subconjunctival hemorrhage(option B)
• uveitis(option c)
• complications such as retinal hemorrhage(option D), retinal edema, macular ischemia, macular edema, vitreous hemorrhage, vitritis, and optic neuritis or papillitis.

Q9,"A 5-year-old boy was brought with the complaints of protrusion of the right eye with no h/o    fever. cT Scan showed a well-defined mass in the orbit with an irregular border and adjacent bony destruction. Biopsy showed small, round cells which were positive for Desmin in
Immunohistochemistry. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)Retinoblastoma
b)cavernous Hemangioma
c)orbital cellulitis
d)Rhabdomyosarcoma","The clinical scenario of a patient with complaints of protrusion of eye with well-defined mass in
the orbit and adjacent bony destruction on cT scan and biopsy showing small, round cells positive for Desmin favors rhabdomyosarcoma.
cavernous hemangioma(option B) and orbital cellulitis(option c) usually are associated with fever, hence ruled out. Retinoblastoma(option A) is associated with Flexner–wintersteiner rosettes on     microscopy, therefore its not correct.
Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood usually in the head and neck region, most common primary orbital malignancy in children. They are malignant tumors
arising from voluntary muscle and produce a rapidly increasing proptosis. It extends in all directions. Diagnosis is done using biopsy in which cross-striations in the tumor cells are   pathognomonic. Myoglobulin is a specific marker but it can also be positive for desmin.



subtypes include embryonal(majority), alveolar, botryoid and pleomorphic.
Treatment includes combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
• Two injections of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and actinomycin D are given at weekly intervals before radiotherapy.
• Radiotherapy is given during which vincristine and cyclophosphamide are administered weekly.
• After radiotherapy, a combination of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin is given for a year or longer in those patients in whom metastases were detected.
other options:
option A: Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy in children. It is associated with mutations in the RB1 gene at chromosome 13q14.  white pupillary reflex or leukocoria is the  most common presenting feature, followed by a squint which is usually convergent.
Histopathology of the tumor shows small round cells with large nuclei. Microscopic features
includes Flexner-wintersteiner rosettes(highly specific of retinoblastoma), Homer-wright
rosettes, pseudorosettes, and fleurettes formation. Areas of necrosis and calcification can also be seen.
option B: cavernous hemangioma is the most common primary benign orbital tumor in adults.
They are composed of large, dilated vascular channels; are more infiltrative; frequently involve
deep structures; and do not spontaneously regress. on histologic examination, the mass is sharply delineated but unencapsulated with large, cavernous blood-filled vascular spaces, separated by
connective tissue stroma.
option c: orbital cellulitis is the most common cause of unilateral proptosis in children. It refers to the acute infection of the contents of the orbit behind the orbital septum. Features
include pain, lid edema, erythema, chemosis, and axial proptosis. Increased pain with movement of eyes and ophthalmoplegia(decreased ocular motility) is a classic symptom. with posterior
exenteration cavernous sinus thrombosis, subdural empyema, and intracranial abscess develop.",,D,
Q10,"A 65-year-old female patient with a history of chronic arthritis on treatment came with
complaints of defective vision in both eyes. on examination, vision in RE = 6/12, LE = 6/18, IoP = 18 mmHg in both eyes, the anterior segment was normal, fundus examination and
fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) findings given in the figure. what is the probable diagnosis?","a)choroiditis
b)chloroquine toxicity
c)Steroid-induced glaucoma
d)Macular edema","The given clinical viginette of female patient on treatment for chronic arthritis which is most
likely the drug chloroquine given for rheumatoid arthritis, now presenting with decreased visual acuity, fundoscopy with a typical bull's eye sign and Fundus fluroscein angiography showing
increased fluroscence in the macular area is suggestive of chloroquine toxicity.
chloroquine and it's derivative hydroxychloroquine (HcQ) are antimalarial drugs which is also used to treat connective tissue disorders such as Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic Lupus
Erythematosus (sLE) and Discoid Lupus.
The maximum dose allowed for chloroquine is 6 mg/kg in 24 hours while for hydroxychloroquine it is 4.5 mg/kg. Hydroxychloroquine has a lower risk of ocular toxicity and hence is percived to be a safer drug but with weaker anti-inflammatory effect.
Manifestations of chloroquine toxicity:
• Reversible on stopping the drug: difficulty in night vision, blurring of vision, diplopia,
keratopathy



• central and paracentral scotomas
• Earliest fundus findings: blunting of foveal reflex, irregularity in the macular pigmentation.
• Advanced stages: 'Bull's eye maculopathy' where the central irregular pigmentation may become surrounded by a concentric zone of hypopigmentation
• End-stage appearance includes bullseye maculopathy, pigmentary degeneration of retina and bone spicule formation, vascular attenuation, and optic atropy.
screening should include a baseline examination for all patients before starting these drugs followed by annual screening starting after 5 years of use.
pre-existing maculopathy is considered a contraindication to treatment with chloroquine and HcQ because underlying abnormalities may mask early toxicity.
screening examinations include visual acuity testing, dilated fundus examination,
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (sD-OcT) testing, and functional assessment with Humphrey test.
various causes of Bull's eye maculopathy are:
• chloroquine and HcQ toxicity
• cone-Rod dystrophy
• Advanced stargardt's disease
• clofazimine retinopathy",2934-1772.PNG,B,
Q11,"A 3o-year-old man presents with a history of injury to the eye caused by a leaf 5 days ago,  resulting in pain, photophobia, and redness of the eye for 2 days. what would be the most likely pathology?","a)Anterior uveitis
b)conjunctivitis
c)Fungal corneal ulcer
d)corneal laceration","The given clinical vignette of the patient presenting with pain, photophobia, and redness of the eye following trauma by a vegetative matter is suggestive of a fungal corneal ulcer.
Fungal corneal ulcer also known as mycotic keratitis is usually caused by trauma from vegetative matter such as branches of trees, leaves and animal tails. Injudicious use of topical steroids and   antibiotics increases the predisposition to develop secondary fungal keratitis.
Mycotic keratitis can be caused by
• Filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus and Fusarium
• yeasts such as candida and cryptococcus
• Dimorphic fungi such as Histoplasma and Blastomyces
Typically in fungal corneal ulcers, the signs are more prominent than the symptoms. The symptoms of fungal keratitis are similar to that of bacterial ulcers which include pain,
lacrimation, photophobia, blurred vision, and redness of the eyes.
A typical fungal ulcer has the following signs:
• Greyish white looking dry corneal ulcer with rolled out margin.
• Feathery finger-like extensions into the corneal stroma under intact epithelium



• wessley ring which is a sterile immune ring that occurs due to the deposition of immune complexes
• Multiple small satellite lesions around the ulcer
• Hypopyon: The hypopyon in fungal ulcer is immobile and unsterile unlike bacterial ulcer (sterile hypopyon)
• perforation is rare
• corneal vascularization is usually absent.
A diagnosis of fungal ulcer is made by a typical history of trauma with vegetative matter followed by clinical examination and KoH mount or SDA agar cultures from corneal scrappings.
The image below depicts a fungal corneal ulcer with the arrowhead indicating a satellite lesion.


other options:
option A: Anterior uveitis is the inflammation of the uveal tissue from the iris up to the pars plicata of the ciliary body. Infectious uveitis can be caused by the exogenous entry of the
organisms following penetrating injuries, perforation of corneal ulcer, and post-intaocular operations.
Acute anterior uveitis presents with symptoms of pain, photophobia, lacrimation, blurring of vision and redness of the eye. Signs of anterior uveitis include:
• Aqueous flare -  It is the earliest sign of acute anterior uveitis, it occurs following the leakage of protein particles into the aqueous humor.
• Keratic precipitates(Kp) - These are pathognomonic for anterior uveitis. They are proteinaceous cellular deposits at the back of the cornea arranged in a triangular fashion. These include mutton fat Kp's as seen in granulomatous uveitis and granular Kp's of non granulomatous uveitis.
• Iris nodules: typically occur in granulomatous uveitis. Koppe's nodules are at the pupillary border and Busacca's nodules are situated near the collarette.
option c: conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva of which the bacterial
conjunctivitis is the most common. Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is characterized by marked



conjunctival hyperemia, swelling of the conjunctiva(chemosis), edematous eyelids, sticking together of lid margins and mucopurulent discharge from the eye.

Q12,what is the angle subtended by the largest alphabet on the snellen's chart at 6om distance?,"a)5
b)3o
c)5o
d)1o","The angle subtended by the largest alphabet on the snellens chart at 6om distance is 5 minutes.
visual acuity is a measure of the spatial resolution of the eye or an estimation of its ability to discriminate between two points. snellens chart is used for visual acuity assesment.
In snellens chart the alphabets decrease in size as we move from above-downwards and these
lines, from above-downwards should be read at 6o, 36, 24, 18, 12, 9, 6, 5 and 4 m respectively. At these distances, the respective letters subtend a visual angle of 5 minutes. Hence, the largest
alphabet that should be read at 6o m subtends a visual angle of 5 minutes in the eye.",,A,2957-1793.PNG;2957-1792.PNG
Q13,Identify the marked layer of the retina.,"a)Inner plexiform layer
b)External limiting layer
c)Internal limiting layer
d)outer plexiform layer","The inner plexiform layer is the marked layer in the given histological image of retina, identified as the fourth layer from the uppermost (innermost) layer.
The retina consists of 1o layers. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is the outermost layer -
below the Bruch's membrane of the choroid - and the internal limiting membrane is the innermost layer - separating the retina from the vitreous.
The retinal pigment epithelium consists of a single layer of cells containing pigment. It is
separated from the neurosensory retinal layers by the potential space between them which is known as interphotoreceptor matrix.
The inner plexiform layer consists of synapsing nerve fibers. The axons of bipolar cells synapse with dendrites of ganglion cells; and both these processes synapse with processes



of amacrine cells. It also contains some horizontally placed internal plexiform cells; and also a few ganglion cells.",2935-1773.PNG,A,2958-1794.PNG
Q14,The spectacles shown in the image are not used for the management of which of the following?,"a)presbyopia
b)Aphakia
c)pediatric pseudophakia
d)Hypermetropia","The given image shows spectacles made of lenses with two different optical power. Thus, it is a pair of bifocal spectacles which is not used in hypermetropia or myopia.
Bifocal glasses have different corrective powers in the upper segment for distant vision and lower segment for near vision. Thus, they are useful in conditions where both distance and near vision   are affected, like the following:
1. presbyopia (option A): It is a definitive indication. It is used to correct age-related near and far vision defects.
2. Aphakia (option B): It provides both near and far vision correction when intra-ocular lens insertion is contraindicated.
3. paediatric pseudophakia (option C): It is used to correct refractive errors or accommodative fluctuations post intra-ocular lens (IOL) insertion.
4. Non refractive accomodative esotropia
In hypermetropia there is defect in near vision only and hence a single vision glasses having uniform corrective power throught the entire surface is used instead of bifocal glasses.",2936-1774.PNG,D,2959-1795.PNG

Q16,"The child in the picture has large corneas, photophobia, and lacrimation. what is the likely diagnosis?","a)congenital glaucoma
b)Retinoblastoma
c)congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy
d)Megalocornea","The given clinical scenario of an infant with large corneas, lacrimation and photophobia supported with the image is suggestive of congenital glaucoma.
Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) also known as developmental glaucoma refers to abnormally high intraocular pressure(IOP) which results from the developmental anomaly of the angle of the anterior chamber.
It can be classified as:
• True congenital or newborn glaucoma in which IOP is elevated during intrauterine life and the baby is born with ocular enlargement.
• Infantile glaucoma: which manifests prior to age 3 years.



• Juvenile glaucoma: IOP rises between 3 and 16 years of age.
clinical findings include:
• Blepharospasm
• Buphthalmos: Large eyeball due to stretching of the globe from elevated IOP prior to the age of 3 years.
• corneal enlargement:
• corneal haze is due to corneal edema.
• Blue sclera - due to the shining of the underlying uveal tissue through the thinned-out sclera
• Haab striae are healed breaks in Descemetls membrane Treatment:
• Goniotomy - when the angle of the anterior chamber is visible through the clear cornea.
• Trabeculectomy when the corneal clouding prevents visualization of the angle.
• Filtration procedures such as Trabeculectomy or combined trabeculectomy with trabeculectomy if the above procedures fail.
• Glaucoma drainage devices in unresponsive cases.
Other options:
Option A: Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy of childhood that is seen between 1-2 years.
Findings of Retinoblastoma include:
• Leukocoria (white pupillary reflex)- the most common manifestation
• strabismus
• Painful red eye with secondary glaucoma
• An endophytic tumor grows into the vitreous as a white mass that may 6seed’ into the gel. If
calcification is present it gives a ""cottage cheese appearance"". An exophytic tumor grows outwards and causes overlying exudative retinal detachment.
The image below shows the leucocoria of the left eye.





option C: Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) is an inherited corneal dystrophy that manifests since birth with endothelial degeneration. It appears as diffuse bilateral corneal     edema in the absence of elevated IoP. The clinical features of the disease include corneal
clouding, visual impairment, and nystagmus.
option D: Megalocornea is a bilateral non-progressive X-linked condition that most commonly
affects males. In this condition, the horizontal corneal diameter is ≥12mm(&lt;2 years) and is ≥13   mm(&gt;2 years). It is characterized by a clear cornea, normal corneal thickness, and no breaks in the descemet's membrane. Systemic associations of Megalocornea include Marfan's syndrome,
Apert syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos, and Down syndrome.",2937-1775.PNG,A,Picture26.png
Q17,The following image indicates:,"a)Trochlear nerve palsy
b)Lateral rectus palsy
c)Internuclear ophthalmoplegia
d)occulomotor palsy","The given image is suggestive of oculomotor nerve palsy.
The central image shows the primary position of gaze where the patient's left eye is deviated down and out with ptosis of the left eyelid. From the eye movements in other positions, it can be seen
that adduction and elevation are absent and depression is reduced in the left eye. All of these findings are indicative of oculomotor nerve palsy.
3rd Cranial nerve(oculomotor nerve) palsy presents with:
• Ptosis due to weakness of levator palpebrae superioris muscle (LPS)
• Abduction and depression in the primary position (down and out) due to unopposed action of the lateral rectus(6th nerve supply) and superior oblique muscles(4th nerve supply)
• Dilated pupil and defective accommodation due to parasympathetic palsy (involvement of Edinger westphal parasympathetic supply)
• Limited adduction, elevation and depression due to ipsilateral paralysis of medial rectus, inferior oblique and inferior rectus .





option A: Trochlear(4th cranial) nerve palsy presents with superior oblique muscle paralysis. clinical findings of trochlear nerve palsy include:
•  Hypertropia (elevation) in the primary position
• Extorsion that is greatest in abduction
• compensatory head posture with contralateral face turn and head tilt with chin slightly depressed. This position is assumed to avoid Diplopia.
• Limitation of depression
• Normal abduction and elevation.
The below given image depicts 4th cranial nerve palsy.


option B: Lateral rectus palsy is seen in cases of isolated Abducens nerve palsy. These patients    present with esotropia/convergent squint in primary position with limitation of abduction on the



side of the lesion. This is due to unopposed action of the medial rectus muscle in the affected eye.
There is also a compensatory head turn towards the side of the lesion to reduce the symptom of Diplopia. The adduction is normal in lateral rectus palsy.


option C: Internuclear opthalmoplegia occurs following an injury to the medial longitudinal
fasciculus (MLF). A unilateral lesion to the MLF leads to the failure of adduction in the ipsilateral eye with a normal abduction of the contralateral eye.
The below given image depicts the pathogenesis of Inter nuclear opthalmoplegia in detail.",2938-1777.PNG,D,3046-1856.PNG;2963-1797.PNG;2964-1798.PNG;2965-1799.PNG
Q18,"A 26-year-old female patient presents with 6/6o visual acuity in one eye and 6/18 in the other eye. she has recurrent episodes of diminution of vision which recovers on treatment with
steroids. she also has a history of transverse myelitis. what is the most probable diagnosis?","a)Hereditary spastic quadriplegia
b)subacute combined degeneration
c)Neuromyelitis optica
d)Multiple sclerosis","The given clinical vignette of a patient presenting with decreased visual acuity and a history of transverse myelitis which is treated with steroids is indicative of Neuromyelitis optica (NMO).
Neuromyelitis optica also known as Devic's disease is an autoimmune demyelinating disease in
which antibodies are formed against Aquaporin 4 present in the cell membranes of Astrocytes. It is characterized by the findings of unilateral or bilateral optic neuritis developing within a few
weeks of transverse myelitis(demyelination of the spinal cord). The disease may be monophasic or recurrent.
Diagnostic criteria for Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD):
Diagnostic criteria for NMOSD associated with AQp4-IgG
• At least 1 core clinical characteristic
• A positive test for AQp4-IgG using the best available detection method (cell-based assay)
• Exclusion of alternative diagnoses
core clinical characteristics:
• Optic neuritis is usually bilateral and causes severe visual loss.
• Acute myelitis- may be severe, transverse and typically longitudinally extensive involving three or more contiguous vertebral segments.
• Area postrema syndrome: episodes of otherwise unexplained hiccups or nausea or vomiting
• Acute brainstem syndrome
• Symptomatic narcolepsy  associated with NMOSD-typical diencephalic MRI lesions
For acute cases of NMO, high-dose glucocorticoids or plasma exchange is used. Mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, and glucocorticoids with azathioprine are used for prophylaxis against
relapses.



The FDA has approved satralizumab, a humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of NMO spectrum disorder with AQP4 antibody positivity.
Eculizumab, a complement inhibitor, and inebilizumab, a B-cell depletion agent, are two more new drugs that have recently been approved for use in NMO attack prevention.
A history of transverse myelitis with optic neuritis(decreased visual acuity) rules out Multiple
sclerosis(option D). It is an autoimmune inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the CNS that affects both upper motor neurons (UMN) and lower motor neurons (LMN) with involvement of     sensory system, ocular system and bowel and bladder function. Ocular manifestations of MS
include Optic neuritis(usually retrobulbar)- decreased visual acuity, internuclear ophthalmoplegia and nystagmus.",,C,
Q19,which of the following is the site of lesion in internuclear ophthalmoplegia?,"a)Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus
b)6th Nerve nucleus
c)pontine paramedian reticular formation
d)A &amp; C","In internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) the lesion is at the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). In INO, there is impaired adduction on the ipsilateral side of the lesion, and nystagmus on
abduction on the contralateral side. when the gaze is initiated in the motor cortex, the horizontal gaze center or the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) generates the eye movements.  The PPRF has two outputs. The first is to the ipsilateral 6th cranial nerve nucleus which causes     abduction of the ipsilateral eye. The second output is to the contralateral MLF which sends an
impulse to the contralateral 3rd cranial nerve nucleus causing contralateral adduction. These two outputs from PPRF lead to conjugate movement of the eyes to the same side.
Therefore, a lesion in the right MLF leads to failure of the right eye adduction. The left eye, however, abducts normally. This is called internuclear ophthalmoplegia.
The following image shows the pathway for horizontal eye movements as described above.",,A,2966-1800.PNG;2967-1801.PNG
