Q2,"A middle-aged housewife consumed rodenticide powder and presented with K+ levels of 2.5meq. on examination, irregular pulse with muscle paralysis is present. ECG shows
ventricular ectopics. what is the suspected poison?","a)Aluminium phosphide
b)zinc phosphide
c)Barium carbonate
d)warafarin tablets","The above clinical scenario with a presentation of hypokalemia, cardiac arrhythmia and paralysis after consumption of rodenticide poison is caused by Barium carbonate.
Barium carbonate is used in rat poised, a local corrosive irritant that, after absorption, mainly acts on muscles including the heart muscles.



The initial symptoms manifest as intense gastrointestinal distress, including nausea, vomiting,
and diarrhoea. subsequently, muscle cramps and stiffness, pupil dilation, tongue and larynx
paralysis, and vertigo occur. Early impacts on the heart lead to elevated blood pressure, a slow
and irregular pulse, and potential cardiac arrest in systole. Among the most notable changes are a loss of reflexes and paralysis.
Treatment involves the following steps:
• Gastric lavage to remove contents and administration of either sodium sulfate or magnesium sulfate solution to precipitate barium as insoluble sulfate.
• Intravenous administration of 1o ml of 1o% sodium sulfate every 15 minutes to convert the soluble salt into insoluble sulfate.
• Purging with magnesium sulfate and repeated bowel lavage.
• symptomatic management.
other options:
option A: Aluminium phosphide (ALP) is a solid fumigant pesticide, insecticide and rodenticide. ALP has a garlicky odour. Phosphine is a toxic agent. It acts by inhibiting the electron transport  resulting from preferential inhibition of cytochrome oxidase.severe toxicity produces ARDs,
cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, pulmonary oedema, convulsions and coma.
cardiogenic shock is the most common cause of death, associated with higher mortality(35%- 1oo%) but does not cause hypokalaemia.
option B: zinc phosphide poisoning can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhoea, and weakness. However, these symptoms are generally less severe compared to aluminium phosphide poisoning due to the highly toxic nature of phosphine gas released by
aluminium phosphide.
option D: warfarin is an anticoagulant used in rat poison but is not directly associated with hypokalemia.",,C,
Q3,which of the following antidotes are used to treat cyanide toxicity?,"a)1 and 2
b)1, 2 and 3
c)1, 3 and 4
d)3 and 4","Amyl nitrite, sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate are antidotes used to treat cyanide toxicity.
cyanide acts by inhibiting the activity of enzyme systems like cytochrome oxidase and carbonic
anhydrase. It inhibits the final step of oxidative phosphorylation, preventing the synthesis of ATP and its usage as an energy source. cyanide reduces the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity and
combines with the ferric iron atom of intracellular cytochrome oxidase, inhibiting oxygen intake for cellular respiration.
Treatment primarily aims at reversing the cyanide-cytochrome combination by providing nitrites which convert haemoglobin to methaemoglobin.
cyanides combine with methaemoglobin to produce non-toxic cyanmethaemoglobin, which, in the presence of rhodanase and sulphate donors such as thiosulphate, transforms cyanide to
thiocyanate, which is eliminated in the urine.
The cyanide kit contains:



• 21 amyl nitrite pearls
• Two 1o ml vials of 3% sodium nitrite
• Two 5o ml vials of sodium thiosulphate.
using a handkerchief, a o.2 ml ampoule of amyl nitrite is broken and held over the patient's nose for 15 to 3o seconds of every minute, until sodium nitrite infusion is started.
IV administration of o.3 g of sodium nitrite in 1o ml of sterile water is given slowly over a
5-minute interval. sodium nitrite forms methaemoglobin (Hb-Fe2+), then competes with
cytochrome oxidase for the cyanide ion, thus protecting cytochrome oxidase. Folllowing this, 25 g of sodium thiosulphate in 5o% solution is given i.v. over a period of 1o minutes. It converts
cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in urine.
Other antidotes such as Hydroxocobalamin (Vit B12) and Dicobalt EDTA can also be used.",,B,
Q4,what is the correct order for opening cavities in case of a foetal autopsy?,"a)1, 3, 2
b)3, 2, 1
c)2, 1, 3
d)1, 2, 3","During the postmortem examination of a foetus, cranium is examined first intact along with the dura followed by the abdomen and thorax. The abdomen should be opened before the thorax to note the highest point of the diaphragm. Hence the answer is HEAD&gt;
ABDOMEN&gt;THORAX.
During the removal of body cavities, preference is given depending upon the findings. cavities    that give trace evidence are opened first as compared to cavities that give maximum evidence to reduce the various artefacts.
Body cavities to be opened first:
• New Born: Abdomen&gt; thorax
• poisoning: cranium
• Asphyxial deaths: cranium &gt; Thorax &gt; Abdomen &gt; Neck
The protocol for fetal autopsies differs slightly from that of adult autopsies. It includes examining  the umbilicus, umbilical cord, placenta, scalp hairs, lanugo hairs, nails and their length, skin color and texture, scrotal sac wrinkling, as well as specific fetal measurements of the head, chest, and
abdominal circumference.",,A,
Q5,Match the following:,"a)1-b, 2-c, 3-d, 4-e
b)1-a, 2-b 3-d, 4-c
c)1-d, 2-c, 3-a, 4-e

paraphilias or perversions are sexual stimuli or acts that are deviations from normal sexual behaviors but are necessary for some people to experience arousal and orgasm.
1. Eonism (also known as transvestism) is a sexual perversion, where a person's whole personality is dominated by a desire to be identified as a member of the opposite sex. This is usually seen in    males who obtain sexual pleasure by wearing female clothes. There is no hormonal/genital
abnormality.



2. Algolagnia is sexual pleasure derived from inflicting pain (active algolagnia) or enduring pain (passive algolagnia).
Active algolagnia also called sadism, is the sexual gratification obtained from acts of physical
cruelty or infliction of pain upon one's partner. It is seen more commonly in men. To obtain
sexual gratification the sadist may bite, beat, cut, burn, or otherwise mistreat or abuse his sexual partner.
3. Frotteurism refers to the sexual gratification achieved by touching or rubbing against a non-consenting person. This behavior often occurs in busy and crowded places. It is
predominantly described in men.
4. Necrophilia is an obsession with obtaining sexual gratification from dead bodies.
Bestiality is an act of using a lower animal for sexual gratification. It is an unnatural sexual offence and is punishable in India.

1. Eonism	b. sexual pleasure by wearing clothes of the opposite sex
2. Algolagni a	c. sexual gratification in infli cting pain
3. Frotteuris m	d. sexual gratification by rub bing private parts against an  other person

Q6,The following finding was found in an autopsy. Identity the weapon.,"a)Bullet
b)Hammer
c)Iron rod
d)scissors","The given image shows a well-defined punched-out hole in the inner table of the skull. Hence, it could most probably be an entry wound produced by a bullet.
Entry wound: The initial contact of the missile punches a clean hole through the outer table of the skull. where the bullet emerges internally, the inner table is then unsupported and a cone-shaped plug is detached, forming a crater that is appreciably larger than the external hole.
Bevelling: inner table
punched out hole: outer table
Exit wound: If the bullet traverses the cranium and penetrates the opposite side, then the same    pattern occurs, but this time with the small hole on the inner table and the crater on the outside.
Bevelling: outer table
punched out hole: inner table





The sequence of bullet injuries is given by puppe’s rule.
puppe’s rule: It is possible to determine the sequence of injuries in skull fractures caused by blunt injuries to the head because the second fracture ends at the point where a break in cohesion is
already present. The fracture lines created by every other shot extend only up to the fractured     lines produced by the previous shot without continuing over them. Even though this rule is true for all blunt injuries to the skull, it is of particular importance in gunshot wounds.
other options :
option B: Hammer: when a hammer is used, the fracture is circular or in the shape of an arc of a circle. The diameter of the fracture is the same as the striking surface. There are generally no
radiating linear fractures. A depressed fracture is caused by blows from a heavy weapon with a
small striking surface. It is also called a signature fracture as the pattern of fracture resembles the weapon or object used.
The following is an image of a depressed fracture:




option C: Iron Rod: An irregular missile such as an iron rod would produce several irregular lacerated wounds, and the exit wounds are larger than the entrance wounds.
The following is an image of the famous 3D model of phineas Gage's skull, who survived a workplace injury of a tamping iron rod through his skull.",2873-1729.PNG,A,2880-1732.PNG;2880-1731.PNG;2881-1733.PNG
Q7,"Marshall's triad (punctate lacerations, bruises, and abrasions) is seen in which type of blast injury?","a)primary blast injury
b)secondary blast injury
c)Tertiary blast injury
d)Quaternary blast injury","Marshall's triad in a bomb explosion is seen due to secondary blast injuries.
Marshall described the characteristic injuries associated with bomb explosions. It includes:
• Abrasions
• Bruises/ contusions
• puncture lacerations
Blast injuries are classified as:
• primary injuries- effect of transmitted blast waves on gas-containing structures. External injuries are absent and are characterized by internal injuries. The middle ear, lungs, and gastrointestinal    tract are the most susceptible to this.
• secondary injuries- injuries caused by shrapnel and other airborne debris propelled by the    explosion. These injuries may affect any part of the body and sometimes result in penetrating trauma. Most casualties are caused by secondary injuries.
• Tertiary injuries- are caused by blast wind that can throw victims against solid objects.
• Quaternary injuries- all other injuries caused by explosions are not included in the above three categories. eg, flash burns, crush injuries, respiratory effects due to toxic dust, gas, etc.",,B,
Q8,what is not seen in heat exhaustion?,"a)Loss of thermoregulatory mechanism b) Altered sensorium
b)orthostatic Hypotension
c)core body temp below 105°F","Loss of the thermoregulatory mechanism is not seen in heat exhaustion. It is seen in heat stroke.
Heat exhaustion is caused by excessive exposure to heat, leading to nausea, vomiting, dizziness, altered sensorium(option B), thirst, fatigue, headache, sweating, and decreased urine output.
Increases in sweating and dehydration can cause orthostatic hypotension(option C). Body
temperature may rise but does not exceed 4o.5°C (1o5°F). In heat exhaustion, the body maintains thermoregulation and no CNS dysfunction occurs. prompt treatment is essential to prevent the
progression of life-threatening heat stroke.",,A,
Q9,correctly matched antidote with toxicity,"a)Benzodiazepene-Flumazenil
b)Arsenic-Desferrioxamine","Benzodiazepine-Flumazenil is the correct match of toxicity with its antidote.
Flumazenil is a competitive antagonist at the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA A receptor. It antagonizes both the agonist (benzodiazepines) and inverse-agonist (beta-carbolines) of this
receptor.
The duration of clinical effects usually is only 3o–6o min. It is absorbed rapidly after oral
administration, less than a quarter of the drug reaches the systemic circulation. This is due to the extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Flumazenil is eliminated almost entirely by hepatic
metabolism to inactive products with a t1/2 of about 1 hour.
It is primarily indicated for the management of benzodiazepine overdose and the reversal of
benzodiazepine anaesthesia. Flumazenil is only available for intravenous administration. It
reliably reverses the sedation, respiratory depression, and amnesia caused by benzodiazepines.
other options:
option A: In organophosphate poisoning (insecticide) with both muscarinic and nicotinic
manifestations, antidotes administered are atropine and pralidoxime. Atropine is effective against muscarinic receptors. pralidoxime (2-pAM) is a cholinesterase-reactivating agent. Hence, both
drugs must be co-administered to treat both muscarinic and nicotinic symptoms.
option B: Treatment of atropine toxicity includes administration of a short-acting barbiturate or diazepam to control convulsions. physostigmine is used as an antidote to atropine poisoning to   treat delirium and coma. other measures for symptomatic management are respiratory support  and control of hyperthermia.
option D: ■■In Arsenic toxicity, the antidote preferred is freshly prepared hydrated ferric oxide, which converts toxic arsenic to non-toxic ferric arsenite. DMSA (Succimer), British anti-Lewisite  (BAL), and penicillamine can also be used.",,C,
Q10,The compound given in the image below can be used in the treatment of which of the following poisonings?,"a)Aluminium phosphide
b)Mercury
c)phophorus
d)Arsenic","The compound given in the image is copper sulphate. It can be used in the treatment of
phosphorus poisoning.
The initial stage of acute phosphorus poisoning through ingestion involves severe abdominal
discomfort, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Excreta and breath have a garlicky odour. Luminescent
faeces and vomit are characteristically seen (smoky stool syndrome). Direct contact with the skin



can result in second and third-degree burns. shock, hematemesis due to liver failure, and renal insufficiency are potential causes of death.
Regular inhalation of phosphorus fumes, leading to chronic phosphorus poisoning, results in     necrosis of the lower jaw around a decayed tooth. This condition is known as phossyjaw and is associated with the discharge of foul-smelling pus from multiple sinuses.
Gastric lavage with potassium permanganate oxidizes phosphorus into phosphoric acid and phosphates. Activated charcoal can be used to adsorb the poison.
stomach wash with o.2% copper sulphate solution or o.2 g of copper sulphate every 5 minutes
until vomiting occurs. It coats the particles of phosphorus with a film of copper phosphide, which is relatively harmless. As copper has caustic properties and can cause acute poisoning, adequate    care should be taken. copper sulphate was also used for topical application in phosphorus
poisoning. It is not recommended now.
other options:
option A: Aluminium Phosphide has no antidote. Magnesium sulphate is given in ALP poisoning to correct hypomagnesemia and arrhythmias and reduce organ toxicity.
option B and D: British anti-Lewisite (BAL), also known as Dimercaprol, is used as an antidote for Mercury poisoning (except non-alkyl mercury) and Arsenic poisoning.",2875-1730.PNG,C,
Q11,A student consumed an unknown substance and came with shock and pulmonary edema. The silver nitrate breath test is positive. what is the antidote?,"a)BAL
b)pralidoxime
c)Mgso4
d)Atropine","The patient presents with clinical features suggestive of Aluminium phosphide (ALP) poisoning. Magnesium sulphate is given in ALP poisoning to correct hypomagnesemia, arrhythmias and
reduce organ toxicity.
Aluminium phosphide (ALP) is a solid fumigant pesticide, insecticide and rodenticide. ALP has a garlicky odour. Phosphine is a toxic agent. It acts by inhibiting the electron transport resulting     from preferential inhibition of cytochrome oxidase. Aluminium phosphite and Aluminium
hypophosphite are non-toxic agents. Phosphine is a systemic poison and affects all organs of the body. The presence of Hcl in the stomach accelerates this reaction.
signs and symptoms include irritation of mucous membranes and acute respiratory distress in
mild toxicity. Moderate toxicity produces ataxia, numbness, tremors, muscular incoordination
and paralysis. severe toxicity produces ARDs, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure,
pulmonary oedema, convulsions and coma. cardiogenic shock is the most common cause of death and is associated with higher mortality(35%- 1oo%)
There is no specific antidote. Gastric lavage should not be done with warm water as on coming in contact with water, aluminium phosphide releases phosphine and increases the concentration of  toxic agent phosphine, so it is done with potassium permanganate and activated charcoal.
Magnesium sulphate is used to correct hypomagnesemia, arrhythmias and reduces organ toxicity. supportive measures to treat acidosis, shock and hemodialysis can be done.
on post-mortem examination, a garlic-like odour is present at the mouth, nostrils and in the
gastric contents. silver nitrate paper test is done to detect phosphine which turns the paper black. silver nitrate paper test: This test is used to detect aluminium phosphide poisoning.



• Aluminium phosphide (ALP)is used as a pesticide, insecticide, and rodenticide.
• when ALP comes in contact with moisture, it releases an active component called phosphine.
• when the silver nitrate-impregnated filter paper, comes in contact with phosphine the paper turns black in colour.
• The test is done in two methods:
a. Gastric aspirate: 5 mL of gastric aspirate and 15 mL of water are put in a flask and the mouth of the flask is covered with silver nitrate-impregnated filter paper. The flask is heated at 5o°c for 15   to 2o minutes. If the filter paper turns black, it indicates the presence of phosphine.
b. Breath: The patient is asked to breathe in and out through a face mask which is impregnated
with silver nitrate. If the face mask turns black, it indicates the presence of phosphine. The breath test is positive only if the patient ingests more than 6 grams of aluminium phosphide.",,C,
Q12,cytochrome c oxidase present in ETc can be blocked by all except?,"a)carbon monoxide
b)cyanide
c)Nitric oxide
d)Hydrogen sulphide","Nitric oxide cannot block cytochrome c oxidase present in ETc.
Nitric oxide: while No can modulate ETc activity and inhibit respiration temporarily, it does not universally block complex IV like the other inhibitors. (option c)
cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) in the electron transport chain (ETc) is the terminal enzyme that facilitates the transfer of electrons to molecular oxygen, reducing it to water. Various
inhibitors can block this process, leading to impaired oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis:
carbon monoxide: co binds strongly to the heme iron of cytochrome c oxidase in its reduced
(ferrous, Fe²■) state. This prevents oxygen from binding and accepting electrons, halting the
production of water and the proton gradient. Poisoning with co can lead to severe hypoxia at the cellular level, even in the presence of normal oxygen levels. (option A)
cyanide: cyanide binds irreversibly to the ferric (Fe³■) iron in the heme group of cytochrome c oxidase. It completely blocks electron transfer to oxygen, making it a potent inhibitor. cyanide  poisoning results in rapid cellular asphyxiation and is life-threatening. (option B)
Hydrogen sulfide: Inhibits complex IV at high concentrations by binding to its heme groups, similar to cyanide. Its inhibition is dose-dependent, but it remains a strong inhibitor at high   levels. (option D)",,C,
