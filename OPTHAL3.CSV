Q1,"A patient presented with painless decrease in vision and metamorphopsia. Fundus
examination revealed the lesion shown in the image. what is the expected finding on angiography?","a)smoke-stack appearance
b)Inkblot appearance
c)collarstud appearance
d)Double circulation","The clinical vigenette is of a patient presenting with painless dimunition of vision and
metamorphopsia with the right fundus showing choroidal melanoma superotemporal to the optic disc and involving the macula.
In this patient a “Double circulation” pattern consisting of an internal circulation within the lesion and the normal vascularity of the overlying retina will be seen on angiography.
Although collar stud(option c) appearance is pathagnomic for choroidal melanoma, it can be seen on B-scan and not on angiography.
choroidal melanoma is a primary intraocular malignancy in adults that peaks around 6o years of age.
Symptoms include a range of visual disturbances such as painless decrease in vision and metamorphosia when macula is involved.
other features of choroidal melanoma includes:
• A solitary elevated subretinal grey-brown dome shaped mass
• clumps of orange pigment are common over the mass
• collar stud appearance on B-scan (option c): It is pathagnomic of choridal melanoma. It is seen if the tumour breaks through the Bruch's membrane into the subretinal space .
• Associated haemorrhage
Smoke stack pattern (option A) and ink blot (option B) pattern is seen on FFA in central serous retinopathy (cSR).
cSR is the spontaneous serous detachment of the sensory neuroretina in the foveal region with or without retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) detachment.
This occurs due choroidal vascular hyperpermeability.
on FFA it is initially seen as an ink-blot pattern or smoke stack pattern
of hyperfluorescence which then spreads to take the configuration
of mushroom or umbrella pattern.
The below given images depict the smoke stack pattern and mushroom pattern respectively",2968-1802.PNG,D,2950-1789.PNG;2950-1788.PNG
Q2,The test given below in the image is used for:,"a)ocular deviation
b)stereopsis test
c)Refractive errors
d)colour Blindness","The given image is of Titmus stereotest, which is done for the assesment of stereopsis (perception of depth).
• The pictures consist of a housefly for children and circular patterns for adults.
• The picture is held in front of the eyes of the patient at a distance of about 16 inches and the patient is asked to wear polarized glasses.
• If the patient's perception of the depth is normal, the housefly appears to rise above the plane,   like a 3D image. If the patient is asked to pinch the wings of the housefly, he/she will try to pinch in the air, above the plane of the image.



• If the patient's perception of depth in either eye is defective, then the image appears just like normal 2D image.
option A: Tests for ocular deviation include
• Cover tests
• prism cover test- This will tell the amount of deviation in prism dioptres.
• Maddox rod test
• Hirschberg corneal reflex test
The below given image shows Maddox rod test.


option C: Test for refractive error includes
• Retinoscopy
• Auto refractometry
The below given image shows the findings of Retinoscopy in different refractive errors.






option D: Tests for colour blindness include
• Ishihara test: It is frequently used to screen for a red–green colour vision deficit. It consists of a test plate followed by 16 plates, each with a series of dots arranged to show a shape or number
that the subject is asked to identify.
• Hardy–Rand–Rittler test: It is similar to ishihara test but is used to detect all three color vision defect.
• Farnsworth–Munsell 1oo-hue test: Is the most sensitive test for both acquired and congenital colour blindness. It consists of 85 caps of different hue that needs to be rearranged.
The below given image depicts the ishihara test.",2969-1804.PNG,B,2976-1808.PNG;2977-1810.PNG;2978-1811.PNG
Q3,A patient presents to the emergency and his ocular examination reveals the following. which of the following is not done initially?,"a)Removal of the foreign body
b)check for visual acuity
c)Give antibiotics
d)Do primary survey","The above image shows penetrating injury by a metallic fish-hook.
In cases of penetrating injuries, the foreign body is removed only after ascerting it's location through a CT scan.
Hence, Removal of the foreign body is not done initially in these injuries. It is surgically explored &amp; repaired under OT settings.
Management of penetrating injuries of the eye include:
• primary survey (Option D) of the patient and the wound
• visual acuity assesment (Option B) in both normal and injured eye
• A CT scan is performed to localize the foreign body and detect any intaorbital or intracranial extensions.
• MRI is contraindicated for metallic foreign bodies.
• prophylactic intravitreal antibiotics (option C) are prescribed",2969-1803.PNG,A,
Q4,An Intraocular lens was placed uneventfully in a young patient during cataract surgery. what should be done then?,"a)IOL replaced every 1o years
b)Never replaced
c)Replaced when secondary cataract develops
d)Replaced when presbyopia develops","uneventful intraocular lens placement, is not an indication for replacing the IOL.
An IOL replacement (IOL exchange) may be done under the following conditions:
• Incorrect IOL placed
• posterior or anterior dislocation of IOL
• Hyphema



• Asymmetrical Haptic placement
• sunset syndrome
• Lens-Bag Decentration
option c: In the event that secondary catarct develops, it is treated by surgical or laser (Nd:yaG) posterior capsulotomy.
option D: presbyopia is a disorder of accomdation seen in old age. It is usually corrected by prescription unifocal or Bifocal or multifocal glasses or contact lenses.",,B,
Q5,what is the first step in the management of an 18-month-old child with both eyes deviated medially:,"a)Forced ductions test
b)Examination under anaesthesia
c)Refractive error testing
d)Examination of fundus","In children, who present with a convergent squint, the first step is to check the visual acuity and estimate the error of refraction.
convergent squint also known as Esotrpia is commonly seen in children with hyperopia (also
known as hypermetropia) of which the accomdative type of esotropia is more common in the age group below 3 years.
The first line of management in the treatment of esotropia includes refractive error correction with glasses.
If a child with accomdative issues, is unable to use spectacles (such as a child ≤ 2 years) or is non compliant with wearing glasses we can eliminate accommodation by temporarily treating him
with miotic drugs such as echothiophate.
Further treatment may include orthoptic training with specific exercises or surgical
correction when the angle of squint is 1o° or more with correcting lenses and when orthoptic training doesnt help in reasonable correction of the squint.
Mnemonic:
The algorithm for the management of accommodative esotropia is as follows:
• R: Refractive correction: Glasses/Miotics
• o: orthoptics/occlusion: for amblyopia
• o: operative correction: for non-accommodative component
• p: prism correction: for remaining error
classification of Accomdative esotropia:
The below image shows accomdative esotropia before and after correction.

option A: Forced Duction Test (FDT) is performed to differentiate between the paralytic and restrictive type of inconcomitant squint.
FDT is positive in restrictive squint where a resistance is encountered during passive rotation.",,C,2980-1812.PNG;2980-1813.PNG
Q6,which of the following is correct regarding the image given below:,"a)It is called Argyl Robertson pupil
b)Both eyes are abnormal
c)The vision is normal in right eye
d)Seen in optic neuritis, the pupil can paradoxically dilate in the both eyes","The given image of ""swinging flashlight test"" shows both pupils constricting when the left eye is stimulated (normal response) followed by both pupils abnormally dilating when the right eye is stimulated (abnormal response).
This finding is suggestive of Marcus Gunn pupil which is also known as Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD).
In this patient the right eye is defective (option A) and the left eye is normal (rules out option B).
Marcus Gunn pupil refers to the paradoxical response of the pupil to light and it is the earliest    sign of optic nerve disease such as optic neuritis or optic nerve damage in glaucoma.It is caused due to a defect in the afferent pathway (optic nerve) of the pupillary light reflex in one eye.
Normal response to stimulation of the eye is constriction of the pupil of the stimulated eye (direct light reflex) and also of the contralateral eye (indirect or consensual light reflex).
causes of RAPD:
• optic nerve lesions (e.g.All types of optic neuritis, glaucoma)
• optic tract lesions (e.g., infarction)
• severe retinal disease (e.g., central retinal artery occlusion, extensive retinal detachment)
• Maculopathy (macular degeneration )
The below given image depicts the findings seen in Marcus Gunn pupil (RAPD).


option A:Argyl Robertson pupil is seen in neurosyphilis. In this condition,on light stimulation both the pupils will not constrict, but on accommodation (near target) both the pupils will
constrict.
Argyll Robertson pupil is attributed to a dorsal midbrain lesion of neurosyphilis that affects the pupillary light pathway but spares the more ventrally placed pupillary near reflex
pathway(Accomdation pathway), thereby causing a light-near dissociation.
Features of Argyll Robertson pupil (ARP) include:



• Bilateral small, irregular pupils in dim light
• Accommodation Reflex Present (ARP)- The eye accomdates by constricting the pupil for a near target.
• Light Reflex absent: pupils do not constrict when exposed to bright light.
• cocaine eye drops(mydriatics) induced mydriasis.",2971-1805.PNG,D,2981-1814.PNG
Q7,A person is diagnosed to have diabetes on his 45th birthday. when will you recommend a dilated fundus examination for him?,"a)Immediately
b)Before his 5oth birthday
c)After his 5oth birthday
d)when he complains of decrease in vision","A 45 year old diagnosed with diabetes mellitus is likely to have type 2 diabetes and thus, he should undergo screening for diabetic retinopathy immediately.
Duration of diabetes is the most important risk factor for developing diabetic retinopathy,
especially proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The recommendations for first fundus examination in diabetic retinopathy is:
• within 3-5 years of diagnosis in type 1 diabetes
• Immediately in type 2 diabetes.
Later, the screening is continued once every year in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. In the event proliferative diabetic retinopathy develops, screening is done more frequently - once every 2
months.",,A,
Q8,ETDRS study was related to?,"a)central retinal artery occlusion
b)Diabetic macular edema
c)primary open angle glaucoma
d)Non-infectious uveitis","Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) was a randomized clinical trial that studied the effect of photocoagulation on diabetic macular edema.
The results of the study demonstrated the beneficial effects of focal photocoagulation on diabetic  macular edema. The study resulted in the recommendation that all eyes with clinically significant diabetic macular edema should be considered for focal photocoagulation.",,B,
Q9,"A patient with a history of diabetes and hypertension underwent fundus fluorescent
angiography (FFA) to evaluate his decreasing vision. The FFA yields an image as shown below, which is characteristic of:","a)Macular ischemia
b)Macular edema
c)submacular haemorrhage
d)premacular haemorrhage","The fundus fluorescent angiography (FFA) image shows enlarged foveal avascular zone, seen as a   hypofluorescent patch in the macula (white arrow), with surrounding capillary non perfused areas (blue arrow). Both of these are suggestive of macular ischemia.





The above mentioned findings when combined with the history of diabetes in this patient points towards the diagnosis of diabetic macular ischemia.
FFA images in a case of diabetic retinopathy are given below:
• Non proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NpDR)
• punctate or pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence - microaneurysms
• Abnormal branching of arteriovenous shunt - intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA)
• patchy filling defects of ischemia due to capillary atrophy or non perfusion
• Increase in the size of hypoperfusion in foveal avascular zone in macular ischemia
2. proliferative diabetic retinopathy(pDR)
• Fluorescein leakage - in retinal neovascularization.
• Leakage in the disc region suggests neovascularization of the disc (NVD) and leakage in other regions suggests neovascularization elsewhere (NVE).
The image below shows pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence and areas of fluorescein leakage in the fundus.





option B: Macular edema also known as cystoid macular edema (CME) is a collection of fluid
between the outer plexiform layer and the inner nuclear layer of the retina following a break in the blood-retina barrier. on fundoscopy, a honeycomb appearance is seen, and on FFA, flower petal     pattern can be seen. The below image shows the flower petal pattern on FFA as seen in CME.


option C: submacular hemorrhage also known as subretinal hemorrhage will obscure the
choroidal dye visualization and appaers as ill defined areas of hypoperfusion in the corresponding area. The retinal vessels overlying the area would, however will be visualized. There are no
assosciated features of pinpoint hyperfluorescence and vascular leakage that are usually seen with diabetic macular ischemia. The below given images show fluorescein angiography which reveal
blocked fluorescence in the maculae of both eyes due to subretinal hemorrhages.





option D: Premacular hemorrhage is a term used to define vitreous hemorrhage that occurs in the subhyaloid space. It is seen as a region of hypofluorescence with no overlying retinal vasculature    visualization on FFA.",2972-1806.PNG,A,2984-1816.PNG;2983-1815.PNG;2928-1767.PNG;2985-1818.PNG;2985-1817.PNG
Q10,causes for expanding blind spot are all except __________,"a)pOAG
b)Hypoplasia of optic disc
c)papilledema
d)Medullated nerve fibres","optic disc hypoplasia does not cause enlargement of the blind spot.
The physiological blind spot is an area of absolute scotoma in the visual field, seen in the region of optic disc. It is due to the absence of photoreceptors (rods and cones) in that region. Enlarged
blind spot is seen in primary open-angle glaucoma (PoAG) (option A), papilledema (option C), medullated nerve fibers (option D), optic disc drusen, coloboma of optic disc and
myopic disc with a crescent.



optic nerve hypoplasia is the most common congenital optic disc anomaly. There is
underdevelopment of the optic disc in the disease and it typically presents with a small disc that is surrounded by a yellowish pigmented ring, called the 'double ring sign'.
option A: In primary open-angle glaucoma(PoAG), the optic disc enlargement is seen secondary to increased intra-ocular pressure (IoP) in the eye.
option C: Papilledema is a passive disc swelling seen with raised intracranial pressure. The blind spot is enlarged due to the edema of the optic disc.
option D: Medullated or opaque nerve fibers are the abnormal myelination of nerve fibers of the retina. Normally, optic nerve myelination stops at the level of lamina cribrosa. If the myelination continues beyond the optic disc it leads to the expansion of the blind spot.  on ophthalmoscopic  examination, these are seen as a whitish patch with feathery margins.",,B,
Q11,Identify the structure marked with red arrow,"a)outer limiting membrane
b)Inner plexiform layer
c)outer plexiform layer
d)outer nuclear layer","The marked structure in the slide is the outer plexiform layer of the retina.
The outer plexiform layer (outer synaptic layer) is present between the outer nuclear layer and the inner nuclear layer. This layer stains lightly. This layer consists of the axons of rods and cones
which synapse with dendrites of bipolar neurons and horizontal cells.",2973-1807.PNG,C,2973-1807.PNG
